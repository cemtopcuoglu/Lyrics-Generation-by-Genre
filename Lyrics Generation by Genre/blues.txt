Holy Mother, where are you?
Tonight I feel broken in two.
I've seen the stars fall from the sky.
Holy mother, can't keep from crying.
Oh I need your help this time,
Get me through this lonely night.
Tell me please which way to turn
To find myself again.
Holy mother, hear my prayer,
Somehow I know you're still there.
Send me please some peace of mind;
Take away this pain.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you.
Holy mother, hear my cry,
I've cursed your name a thousand times.
I've felt the anger running through my soul;
All I need is a hand to hold.
Oh I feel the end has come,
No longer my legs will run.
You know I would rather be
In your arms tonight.
When my hands no longer play,
My voice is still, I fade away.
Holy mother, then I'll be
Lying in, safe within your arms.
When I get out on the dancing floor,
There ain't no stopping for an hour more.
I go rocking up and down and around and round.
I go reeling to the beat of that crazy sound.
I can't stop, I want to kiss your pretty lips,
'Cause I know, pretty babe, you got honey in your hips.
I can't stop my feet and I can't stop my hands
When I hear the sound of a rock 'n' roll band.
Gotta rock, gotta roll, gonna jump and shout;
Nobody better come and turn me out.
I'm staying all night till I get my kicks,
'Cause you know, pretty babe, you got honey in your hips.
I want you and you want me.
We're gonna dance all night till we both feel free.
We'll shake and we'll shimmy right across the floor.
When it gets late, we'll dance out the door.
You better get ready with your pretty lips,
'Cause you know, pretty babe, you got honey in your hips.
Gypsy woman told my mother 'fore I was born,
You got a boy-child coming, gonna be a son of a gun.
Gonna make pretty women's jump and shout,
And then the world gonna know what this all about.

But you know I'm here.
Everybody knows I'm here.
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man.
Everybody knows I'm here.

I got the black cat bone and I got a mojo, too.
I got the John the conqueror Root, gonna mess with you.
I'm gonna make you girls lead me by my hand,
And then the world will know the hoochie coochie man.

But you know I'm here.
Everybody knows I'm here.
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man.
Everybody knows I'm here.

On the seventh hour, on the seventh day,
On the seventh month, seven doctors say,
"He was born for good luck, that you'll see."
I got seven hundred dollars; don't you mess with me!

But you know I'm here.
Everybody knows I'm here.
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man.
Everybody knows I'm here.
Well, I wonder, what's exactly the matter
Child you know the time
Seemed like an hour
Everything had changed
But I hold up my head
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man
Well now, I buzzed your bell this morning
You had your elevator run slow
I buzzed your bell in, woman
Take me on the third floor
Well, I hold up my head
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man
Well, I buzzed your bell this morning
You had your elevator run slow
I buzzed your bell in, woman
Take me on the third floor
I hold up my head
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man
Well, I wonder, what's exactly the matter
Child you know the time
Seemed like an hour
Everything had changed
I hold up my head
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man
[Chorus:]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' round my door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more
You told me you was high class
I could see through that
You told me you was high class
I could see through that
And baby I know
You ain't no real cool cat
[Chorus]
You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
'Cause I'm looking for a woman
All your lookin' for is a home
[Chorus]
Baby, I've been downhearted
Ever since the day we met 
Baby, I've been downhearted 
Ever since the day we met 
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get? 
My love burns like a fire
Your love burn like a cigarette
Yes, my love burns like a fire
Your love burn like a cigarette
Yes, I've seen you put it down and crush it
Baby, how blue can you get?
Oh, you're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you are jealous when we're apart 
Yes you're evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you are jealous when we're apart 
How blue can you get, baby?
The answer's right here in my heart 
I gave you a brand-new Ford 
You said "I want a Cadillac"
I bought you a ten dollar dinner 
You said "thanks for the snack" 
I let you live in my penthouse 
You said it was just a shack 
I gave you seven children 
And now you want to give them back 
I've been downhearted, baby 
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues 
Tell me, how blue can you get?
How much do I love you? 
I'll tell you no lie 
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky? 
How many times in a day 
Do I think of you? 
How many roses are 
Sprinkled with dew? 
How far would I travel 
Just to be where you are? 
How far is the journey 
From here to a star? 
And if I ever lost you 
How much would I cry? 
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky?
How long, baby how long,
Has that evening train been gone?
[Chorus:]
How long,
How how long,
Baby how long?
Went to the station, didn't see no train.
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
[Chorus]
I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had.
[Chorus]
I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.
[Chorus]
You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue.
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you.
[Chorus]
Don't have no money for to ride the train.
I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again.
[Chorus]
How long, baby how long
Must I keep my, my watch in pawn?
[Chorus]
I was ready to take a chance,
I found myself a new romance.
Then you call that same old night,
Always change my mind.
Oh no, not again.
Oh no, not again.
[Chorus:]
Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again.
Just when I thought I was free, you come back.
Now I'm hung up on your love again.
Just as I was doing good,
You come back, just to prove you could.
Things will always be the same,
With me the victim of the game.
Oh no, not again.
Oh no, not again.

[Chorus: x4]
Yeah the bells have tolled,
And my baby caught that train and gone.
Oh the bells have tolled,
And my baby caught that train and gone.
Well it's all my fault,
I must have done somebody wrong.
Well it's all my fault,
And I just can't explain.
Yes it's all my fault,
And I just can't explain.
Gonna get me a new doll,
So maybe my luck will change.
My baby's (treating me that my luck would change?)
I've been goin' around,
And now look at me,
Done somebody wrong,
Well it's all my fault,
I must have done somebody wrong.
I just talked to my baby on the telephone,
She said, "Stop what you're doing and baby come on home."
[Chorus:]
I can't hold out,
I can't hold out too long.
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone.
You said, "Baby don't you worry, you're my heart's desire.
You know that I love you, I can't stand to see you cry."
[Chorus]
She said, "Baby you can run, you can walk or fly.
You know that I love you, you're my heart's desire."
[Chorus]
I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby.
I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby.
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone.
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp

I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free

Feel when I dance with you,
We move like the sea.
You, you're all I want to know.

I feel free.
I feel free.
I feel free.

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd.
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud.

I, I, I, I feel free.
I feel free.
I feel free.

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd.
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud.

Dance floor is like the sea,
Ceiling is the sky.
You're the sun and as you shine on me,

I feel free.
I feel free.
I feel free.

I, I, I, I
What would you do if I told you that I'm falling in love again?
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands
A way to make my heart beat faster.
Is this heaven we're living in?
A way to make my life worth living.
I've fallen in love again.
I've got to ask you now, baby:
What would you say if I told you that I'm falling in love again?
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands
A way to make my heart beat faster.
Is this heaven we're living in?
A way to make my life worth living.
I've fallen in love again.
I've got to ask you now, baby:
What would you say if I told you that I'm falling in love again?
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands
A way to make my heart beat faster.
Is this heaven we're living in?
A way to make my life worth living.
I've fallen in love again.
Have you heard that rumour that's going' around
You got it made, way across town
It's the same old story, tell me where does it end
Yes, I heard the news, it's the same old blues again

When I wrote you a letter, you must have read it wrong
I stood at your doorway, but you were gone
I took a lot of courage and let the telephone ring
It's the same old blues, same old blues again

When you give me the business, you know I get a mind
'Cause I've got a lot of patience and I've got a lot of time
It's the same old story, tell me where does it end
It's the same old blues, same old blues again

I'm gonna find me a mountain, I'm gonna hide out
I ain't talking to you and I ain't coming out
Yes, I heard that rumour, tell me where does it end
Yeah it's the same old blues, same old blues again
She took my hand
And tried to make me understand
That she would always be there
But I looked away
And she ran away from me today,
I'm such a lonely man.
It came as no surprise to me
That she'd leave me in misery.
It seemed like only yesterday
She made a vow that she'd never walk away.
She took my hand
And tried to make me understand
That she would always be there
But I looked away
And she ran away from me today,
I'm such a lonely man.
And if it seemed a sin
To love another man's woman, baby,
I guess I'll keep on sinning
Loving her, Lord, till my very last day.
But I looked away
And she ran away from me today,
I'm such a lonely man.
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy, but I say
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
He said, "Kill it before it grows", I say
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down, I say
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out, but I say
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no
I wander helplessly day by day.
It's so much easier to run away.
My mind is spent, my body sold,
Never knowing which way to go
I'm always there for you baby,
Won't you let me see
If we can get closer.
Every day,
[Chorus:]
I want to be felt by you.
I want to be touched by you.
I want to be loved by you.
I want to be anything you want me to.
Don't mean nothing when you're growing old.
Nobody knows what the future holds.
I am left with a bitter taste,
Torn away from that beautiful chase.
I'm always there for you baby,
Won't you let me see
If we can get closer.
Every day,
[Chorus: x3]
I want a little girl, call my own.
She must be someone who's all alone now.
Say, I want a little girl to fall in love with me, oh yeah.

I want a little girl, but she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book.
If she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T.

And she don't have to wave her hair
Or even wear fancy clothes, I wouldn't even care.
She don't wear nylon hose, oh.

I want a little girl to love a lot.
You know that I'd give her everything I got.
I want a little girl to fall in love with me.
When times are hard and friends are few
And you need someone to help you through
Just call my name and I will come running to your side
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there
When morning comes and nothing's changed
And the world outside plays the same old game
Just call on me and I will ease your lonely heart
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
I will be there
When you are lost in the night
No where to turn
I will be there
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
I will be there
Don't be afraid
I will be there
When every one that you believe still lets you down
I will be there
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Will be there
Don't be afraid
Just call my name
And I will come running to your side
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
I will be there
When you are lost, lost in the night
No where to turn
I will be there
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
I will be there
When everyone that you believe still lets you down
I will be there
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
When you are lost, lost in the night
No where to turn
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day,
That's when my baby went away.
Come back, baby, I wish you would,
Try and love me, you won't do no good.
Walking and a-kissing late at night;
I tell you now baby, I feel just right.
Come now baby, whatcha trying to do?
Trying to love me and some other man, too.
Come now baby, give me one more chance.
You know I still love you, want to give you romance.
Yeah romance, all night long, in my arms, woah yeah.
Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day,
That's when my baby went away.
Come back, baby, I wish you would,
Try and love me, you won't do no good.
You know baby that I love you so.
You know, pretty baby, it hurts me to see you go.
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'd never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now,
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again
Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do
Anything for love
And I'l be there until the final act
I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way, tonight
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls
Maybe I'm lonely, that's all I'm qualified to be
That's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do
Anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you. So long, so long
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do...
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do...
But I'll never stop dreaming of you ev'ry night of my life, no way
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Will you raise me up? will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
I can do that
Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh no, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Will you build and emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
I can do that
I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
I can do that
Oh no, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut trees
The wishing well
And I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer day
In everything that's bright and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you
In the morning sun
And when the night is through
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
In that small cafe
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut trees
The wishing well
And I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer day
In everything that's bright and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you
In the morning sun
And when the night is through
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
Well I can't read and I can't write
And I don't know my left from right.
I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine,
But I'll make love to you any old time at all.
I can't swim and I can't fly,
I ain't no fish, ain't a bird in the sky.
I can't count from one to ten,
And I don't know the shape I'm in.
[Chorus] 
(Well) I'm goin' left 
'Til you lead me to the right 
Lead me to what is right 
I'm goin' left 
'Til you lead me to the right 
Lead me to what is right 
There's a train people say 
I could ride to get my whole life straight 
But the bridge on the way 
Has a toll too much for me to pay 
Yes I know it must be 
What I chose could mean my destiny 
Lights are green all is go 
But my heart keeps telling my mind no 
[Chorus] 
There's a plane over there 
Where all are given even share 
What you get is so small 
It's like never having nothing at all 
Take my hand says a friend 
A will stick with you until the end 
But I'm in doubt I must decline 
'Cause even friends can change their lines 
[Chorus]
EP version
I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
Used to think I knew it,
Man I sure outgrew it.
Things like idle chatter,
Ain't the things that matter,
That's one thing I can do without.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
Things I say at midnight,
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight.
I reached the final conclusion,
And all this persecution,
Don't call me, baby, I'll call you.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
Things I say at midnight,
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight.
I reached the final conclusion,
And all this persecution,
That's one thing I can do without.

I'm not talking,
Well that's all I got to say.
If I said things were awful,
It might just be unlawful.
If I said things were splendid,
You might just be offended.
That's one thing I can do without.

I'm so glad, I'm so glad.
I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad.
I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.
I don't know what to do,
I don't know what to do,

I'm tired of weeping,
I'm tired of moaning,
I'm tired of crying for you.

I'm tired of weeping,
I'm tired of moaning,
I'm tired of groaning for you.
I don't know what to do,
I don't know what to do,
I don't know what to do.
[Chorus: x5]
[Chorus:]
I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found.
I went to the river to jump in.
My baby showed up and said, "I will tell you when."
Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found.
I love you babe with all my heart and soul;
Love like mine will never grow old.
Love you in the morning and in the evening too.
Every time you leave me I get mad with you.
[Chorus]
I love you baby with all my might;
Love like mine is out of sight.
I'll lie for you if you want me to.
I really don't believe that your love is true.
[Chorus]
I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found.
I'm your witchdoctor, got the evil eye,
Got the power of the devil, I'm the conjurer guy.
Gonna teach you love at the midnight hour,
Gonna feel you burning like a passion flower.
[Chorus]
Hey hey, hey hey hey, hey.
Hey hey, hey hey hey, hey.
Your witchdoctor, your witchdoctor, got my eyes on you.
I was born in the country and I lived in the trees.
I got my voodoo from the birds and the bees.
Gonna teach you love at the midnight hour,
Gonna feel you burning, little passion flower.
[Chorus]
I'm your witchdoctor, got the evil eye,
Got the power of the devil, I'm the conjurer guy.
Gonna teach you love at the midnight hour,
Gonna feel you burning like a passion flower.
[Chorus]
I've got my mean old spell on you,
I've got my mean old spell on you,
Your witchdoctor, your witchdoctor, got my eyes on you.
You pretty women,
Standing in line,
Make love to babe,
In my own time
Cause I'm a man,
Turned twenty one,
I spell M-A-N, man
Don't back down,
To Kansas too
Bring back a pretty girl,
Just like you,
Cause I'm a man
I spell m, a, n, man
I've got a feeling we could be serious, girl;
Right at this moment, I could promise you the world.
Before we go crazy, before we explode,
There's something 'bout me, baby, you got to know,
You got to know.
[Chorus:]
I get off on '57 Chevy's
I get off on screaming guitar.
Like the way it gets me every time it hits me.
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart.
Feels like we're falling into the arms of the night,
So if you're not ready, don't be holdin' me so tight.
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain
Here's what you're gettin' and I don't want to change,
I don't want to change.
[Chorus]
I don't need to glitter, no Hollywood,
All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good.
[Chorus]
Well, I've told you for the last time,
Told you for the last time.
[Chorus:]
I'm gonna turn on my love light,
Let it shine one more time,
Let it shine, shine, shine for the last time.
There's gonna be a big change made, and I'm gonna make it.
This time I'm gonna lay it on the line.
I got a lot to give when you're woman enough to take it, oh yeah.
[Chorus]
I sure want to love you baby, baby if you'd only let me.
You only pick me up just to put me down.
I finally let my mind make a decision, oh yeah.
I'm gonna start my wheels a-spinnin',
Let 'em turn one more time,
Let 'em turn, oh yeah, for the last time.
Well, I've told you for the last time,
Told you for the last time.
[Chorus]
Blue sky upon the horizon,
Private eye is on my trail,
And if I don't be there by morning
You know that I must have spent the night in jail.
I've been running from Memphis to L. A.
Had an appointment set sometime for today,
And if I don't be there by morning
You know that I must have gone the other way.
Finding my way back to you girl,
Lonely and blue and mistreated too.
Sometimes I think of you girl,
Is it true that you think of me too?
I got a woman living in L. A.
I got a woman waiting for my pay,
And if I don't be there by morning,
Pack my clothes, get down on your knees and pray.
[Chorus]
I left my woman with a twenty dollar bill.
I left her waiting, I hope she's waiting for me still.
If I don't be there by morning
You know that I, I never will.
If I had possession over judgement day
If I had possession over judgement day
Lord, the little woman I'm lovin' wouldn't have no right to pray

And I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see
And I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see
Man got my woman and the 'a lonesome blues got me

And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
Boy, I woke up this mornin', my biscuit roller gone

Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away
I didn't like the way she done
Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away
And I said in my mind, yo' trouble gon' come someday

And now run here, baby, set down on my knee
Oh now run here, baby, set down on my knee
I wanna tell you all about the way they treated me
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now, I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah
I was a child born so free;
It seems that time has put age on me.
And when I grow old, will I once again find
All of those sweet, innocent times?
I was a child born without fear;
It seems that time has placed me here.
With no freedom to laugh, there's more reason to cry.
I really miss those innocent times.
I used to feel joy in my soul,
But now my sorrow has taken control.
As I look around I pray, Lord be kind;
Just one more taste of those innocent times.
As I look around I pray, Lord be kind;
Just one more taste of those innocent times,
Just one more taste of those innocent times.
The point on the water, there's a change in the air,
A vibe in the darkness but there's nobody there.
I look for the reason but there's nothing to see,
Just a hole in my memory where my mind used to be.
Tell me why
Can I find no relief in my heart.
I reside
In a world that has fallen apart.
Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby,
Show me a way to get back on time, please.
Where do we go, baby, how will I know?
Who holds the key, is it hidden inside of me?
But why should I worry and why do I care
When this road that I walk on is going nowhere.
I stand and I study every face in the crowd,
See the fear in their eyes, they must be thinking out loud.
[Chorus:]
Scratching the surface, it all looks the same;
A world full of anger with no one to blame.
But who can I turn to? Who holds the key?
And who has the answer? I think it's inside of me.
All things considered it looks as though 
Utopia were far closer to us than anyone, only fifteen 
Years ago, could have imagined. 
Then, I projected it six hundred years into the future. 
Today it Seems quite possible that the 
Horror may be upon us within a single century. 
That is, if we refrain 
From blowing ourselves to smithereens in the interval. 
Indeed, unless we choose to decentralize and 
To use applied science, not as the end to which human 
Beings are to be made the means, but as the 
Means to producing a race of free individuals,
We have only two alternatives to choose from, either 
A number of national militarized totalitarianism, 
Having as their root the terror of the atomic 
Bomb and as their consequence the destruction of 
Civilization (or, if the warfare is limited, the 
Perpetuation of militarism) or else one 
Supranational totalitarianism
Called into existence by the 
Social chaos resulting from rapid technological progress in general and 
The atomic revolution in 
Particular, and developing, under the need for efficiency and stability, 
Into the welfare-tyranny of Utopia. 
You pays your money and you takes your choice.
You know it ain't right just to treat me this a way.
Well, you know it ain't right just to treat me this a way.
Well, you know, my baby, have you home one day.
You know it ain't right just to treat me like you do.
Well, you know it ain't right just to treat me like you do.
Well, you know, my baby, coming home to you.
You know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long.
Well, you know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long.
Well, you know, my baby, you done something wrong.
So you think you are something special
I wonder why, baby, is that so
Could admit, you are something special
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know
Yes, I've seen you with your other girlfriends
I can tell they really think you're fine
And I've seen you with your other men friends
They don't know if you're a love of mine
[Chorus:]
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
[Chorus]
'Cause you've taken away
The only thing I ever ever had.
Don't you know that I love you?
Why'd you make me feel bad?
'Cause the only thing I ever loved
Was loving you.
So you think you are something special
I wonder why, baby, is that so
Could admit, you are something special
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know
[Chorus]
So you think you are something special...
What makes you think you are something special?
You said you was hurting,
Almost lost your mind,
And the man you love,
He hurts you all the time.
[Chorus:]
When things go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.
You love him more
When you should love him less.
I pick up behind him
And take his mess.
[Chorus]
He love another woman
And I love you,
But you love him
And stick to him like glue.
[Chorus]
Now you better leave him;
He better put you down.
Oh, I won't stand
To see you pushed around.
[Chorus]
If you need a woman in bed with you
Tell her in front what you can do
It's easy, easy as pie
Don't have to be a ?
You don't have to lie
If you play the guitar it won't be long
You'd be writing and singing, them songs
It's easy, easy you bet
And you've been bet, if you don't quit
If you feel kinda lonesome, a friend's inside
Get yourself a dog and be alright
Get yourself too, lucky me
Now one thing nice, I'll be there twice to love you
It's so easy gettin' through these times
So easy your love and mine
If you wanna think she's ugly and always depressed
She can go out and buy herself a new dress
It's easy, easy for her
Solves all of her problems, that's for sure
It's so easy gettin' through these times
So easy your love and mine
If she cashes your property, you might regret
Use that old plastic, swipe deeper in debt
It's easy, easy you see
If tomorrow never comes, everything is free
It's so easy gettin' through these times
So easy your love and mine
It's so easy gettin' through these times
So easy your love and mine
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you want to do
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you want to do
Yes, at the time, you were loving me, baby
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you
Used to make your own pay checks, baby
And bring them all home to me
I'd go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman, good girl seen
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you want to do
Yes, at the time, you were loving me, baby
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you
Yes, you used to be here with me, baby
But now you're running around with the boys
You said you were gonna leave me
You're gonna be over in Illinois
And it's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you want to do
Yes, at the time, you were loving me, baby
At that time, little girl, I wouldn't be true
Yes, fall on my knees
Raise up my right hand
Yes, I would do better, baby but I
Just don't understand
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes, at the time you were loving me, woman
At that time, little girl, I wouldn't be true
If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who'd watch for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who could it be
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
The jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go
Nobody's right until somebody's wrong
Nobody's weak until somebody's strong
No one gets lucky until luck comes along
Nobody's lonely until somebody's gone
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go
I've seen dark skies, never like this
Walked on some thin ice, never like this
I've told you white lies, never like this
Looked into true eyes, never like this
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright

I don't care what they may say
I don't care what they may do
I don't care what they may say
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah

Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah

Jesus, He's my friend
Jesus, He's my friend
He took me by the hand
Led me far, far from this land
Jesus, He's my friend

Jesus

Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright, oh yeah
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright

What you gonna do on judgement day
The time's run out now, you can't stay
Screaming and crying, you got to go
Turn and say, "Peter won't you open the door?"
Yes, I'm coming
(Yes, I'm coming)
Yes, I'm coming
(Yes, I'm coming)
Yes, I'm coming
Just like my time alone
When I die you can't bury me
Tombstone women at my head and feet
You fold my arms across my chest
You tell me friends that I'm gone to rest
Yes, I'm coming
(Yes, I'm coming)
Yes, I'm coming
(Yes, I'm coming)
Yes, I'm coming
Just like my time alone
When I'm dead right there in my grave
You're gonna be sorry
That you treat me like a slave
There ain't no one can take my place
You're gonna cry your blues away
Yes, I'm coming
Yes, I'm coming
Yes, I'm coming
Just like my time alone
[Chorus:]
Just like a prisoner,
He don't know right from wrong.
Just like a baby,
He sings a pleading song
And that's why
So many tears must fall.
Yes, that's why
So many tears must fall.
Just like a sailor,
He steers away from home.
He feels a tidal wave
In his heart, but he ain't alone
[Chorus]
I'm like that prisoner,
I don't know right from wrong.
Just like that baby,
I sing a pleading song
And that's why
You'll never know how I feel.
Yes, that's why
You'll never know how I feel.
I was laughing
Playing in the streets, I was unknowing
I didn't know my fate
Playing
The game of love, but never really showing
I thought that love could wait
I was a young girl and sure to go astray
You walked right into my life and told me love would find a way
To keep on growing, keep on growing
Keep on growing
I was standing
Looking in the face of one who loved me
Feeling so ashamed
Hoping
And praying, Lord, that he could understand me
But I didn't know his name He took my hand in his and told me I was wrong
He said, you're gonna be all right girl, oh just as long
As you keep on growing, keep on growing
Keep on growing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe
Someday baby, who knows where or when, Lord
Just you wait and see
We'll be walking
Together hand in hand, alone forever
Man just you and me
'Cause time is gonna change us, Lord, and I know it's true
Our love is gonna keep on glowing and growing and it's all we gotta do
Keep on growing, keep on growing
Keep on growing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep on growing, keep on growing
Keep on growing
I never realized that you were in pain.
I want to help you honey, let me see you again.
[Chorus:]
Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough.
Life is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love.
Put a smile on your face and dry away your tears.
Life is bound to get better as you live your years.
[Chorus]
Somewhere in this world, the one you waited for
Come along and find you, turn the key in your door.
Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough.
Life is so bad, baby, when you find the key to love.
I've got a kind hearted woman,
She studies evil all the time.
I've got a kind hearted woman,
She studies evil all the time.
You would do to quit me
As just to have it on your mind.
I've got a kind hearted woman,
Do anything in this world for me.
I've got a kind hearted woman,
Do anything in this world for me.
But these evil hearted women,
Lord, and they will not let me be.
Now it ain't but one thing makes Mr. Clapton drink.
I swear about how you treat me baby, I begin to think.
Oh baby, my life don't feel the same.
It breaks my heart when you call Mr. So-and-So's name.
She's a kind hearted woman,
She studies evil all the time.
She's a kind hearted woman,
She studies evil all the time.
You're best to quit me baby
As just to have it on your mind.
I don't want to lose this good thing that I've got.
If I do, I would surely, surely lose a lot,
'Cause your love is better than any love I know.
[Chorus:]
It's like thunder, lightning,
The way you love me is frightening.
Think I'd better knock on wood, baby.
I'm not superstitious about you, I can't take no chance.
You got me spinning, baby. Baby, I'm in a trance,
'Cause your love is better than any love I know.
[Chorus]
Ain't no secret, that woman is my loving cup.
She sees to it that I get it up.
Just one touch from her, you know can do so much.
[Chorus]
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood.
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood.
Ma, take this badge off of me.
I can't use it any more.
It's getting dark, too dark to see.
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door.
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door.
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door.
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door.
Ma, take these guns away from me.
I can't shoot them any more.
There's a long black cloud following me.
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
[Chorus]
Ma, take this badge off of me.
I can't use it any more.
It's getting dark, too dark to see.
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
[Chorus]
It's the last fair deal goin' down
Last fair deal goin' down
It's the last fair deal goin' down, good Lord

If you cry about a nickel, you'll die about a dime

Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had.
Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had.
She's gone away and left me, that makes me feel so bad.
It's early in the morning and my love is coming down to you.
It's early in the morning and my love is coming down to you.
I'll love you, love you, baby, till I don't know what to do.
Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had.
Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had.
Now you've gone away and left me, that makes me feel so bad.
Well, I met this old woman
She was hard as nails
I think that she just come out
Of the County jail
But I loaned her some money
Just to pay her rent
If I would, she would put me
In her last will and testament
Well, I got lots of children
An ex-wife or two
I never hear from them
Till the bills are due
The money I gave her
They already spent
If I could just help 'em out
They would put me in their last will and testament
You know I'm goin' over sixty
I'm older than most
It won't be long now
I'll be nothin' but a ghost
My intentions
It's my intent
To live on a little deeper
Havin' my last will and testament
And when it's all over
They put you in the ground
Send my belongings
To the 'Lost And Found'
My intent
To leave all the little people
Out of my last will and testament
There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave
Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
The sun ain't nearly on the rise
And we still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies
Love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me?
And don't you ever leave
Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
And don't you ever leave
Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long.
You know it's just your foolish pride.

Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down.
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,
Turned my whole world upside down.

Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane.
Please don't say I'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain.

Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.
What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long.
You know it's just your foolish pride.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.
Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs
To tell me which way I should go to find the answer,
And all the time I know,
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow,
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow,
Love is lovely, let it grow

Looking for a reason to check out of my mind,
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on,
But there's nothing left to show,
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow,
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow,
Love is lovely, so let it grow, let it grow

Time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get what you are needing,
The rest is up to you
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow,
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow,
Love is lovely, let it

Let it grow, let it grow,
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow,
Love is lovely, let it grow
Well now, ooh wee baby, you know I declare, you sure look fine
Well now, ooh wee baby, you know I declare, you sure look fine
Well, a girl like you a make a many man change his mind
Now baby, when you walk you know you shake like a willow tree
Now baby, when you walk you know you shake like a willow tree
Well, a girl like you would love to make a fool of me
Let me love you baby, let me love you baby
Whoa, let me love you baby, yes, let me love you baby
Let me love you baby 'til your good love drives me crazy
I give it all I own just for a little bit of your love

Since I met you baby, that's all I've been livin' for
Let me love you baby, let me love you baby
Mmm
Make it good to me, baby
Whoa
You told me this, you told me that
You try to tell me, tell me where it's at
You said you loved me, and I can see through that
Lies, lies, lies

You left me hangin'
Hangin' from a limb
You said you loved me
Then you left with him
Lord, you did it to me
I see it in your eyes
Lies, lies, lies

Tell me baby, why you take my time
You get a thrill off playing with my mind
Lord, you did it to me, I see it in your eyes
Lies, lies, lies
You're gonna be mine, little girl,
You've been through 18 years of pain.
You're gonna be mine, little girl,
You've been through 18 years of pain.
I'm gonna give you a love, child,
You won't feel bad again.
You've been mistreated, little girl,
But I swear, I swear it'll be outgrown.
You've been mistreated, little girl,
But I swear, I swear it'll be outgrown.
I'm gonna give you a love, child,
Something you've never known.
You're gonna be mine, little girl,
Even if I can't have you by my side.
You're gonna be mine, little girl,
Even if I can't have you by my side.
You're gonna remember the love, child,
That made you satisfied.
I must be invisible
No one knows me.
I have crawled down dead-end streets
On my hands and knees.
I was born with a ragin' thirst,
A hunger to be free,
But I've learned through the years.
Don't encourage me.
[Chorus:]
'cause I'm a lonely stranger here,
Well beyond my day.
And I don't know what's goin' on,
So I'll be on my way.
When I walk, stay behind;
Don't get close to me,
'cause it's sure to end in tears,
So just let me be.
Some will say that I'm no good;
Maybe I agree.
Take a look then walk away.
That's all right with me.
[Chorus]
Out on an open highway,
Such a lovely day but something's wrong.
Something, something's gotta be wrong.
I just left home this morning,
This old road keeps rolling on and on.
Rolling, rolling on and on.
Won't somebody help me?
Won't somebody help me?
Won't somebody help me?
I've never been so lonesome and long way from home,
Never been lonesome and long way,
Never been lonesome and long way from home.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Falling in the deep end
Stop messin' around
I cant keep from falling
When you're not around
I cant no rest when you leave
Your love keeps me burnin'
You got me lost and found
And my world keeps turnin'
It's not the same
When you're gone
Feel like I'm
Half of myself
Cause I need to have you around
I need to hear that sound
Of you creepin in the mornin'
I need to look in your eyes
When it keeps me learnin'
It's not the same
When your gone
Feel like I'm
Half of myself
Cause I can't keep my feet on the ground
You keep me lost and found
And girl it feels good
So, I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around
It's not the same
When you're gone
Feel like I'm
Half of myself
It's not the same
When you're gone
Feel like I'm
Half of a man
But, I can't keep my feet on the ground
You got me lost and found
And, girl, it feels good
So, I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around
Can't keep my feet on the ground
You got me lost and found
And girl it feels good
So, I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around
[Chorus:]
Oh Louise, yes you're the sweetest girl I know.
Don't you know now Louise, you are the sweetest girl that I know.
You made me run from Chicago
Oh, to the Gulf of Mexico.
Now you know Louise,
She's like a rolling stone.
Every time she leave a man,
He has to grieve alone.
Oh Louise, why don't you hurry home?
You know, I never had no good loving,
Oh Louise, since you've been gone.
Got a girl called Mamie,
Treat me nice and kind.
I don't care what she do
Because Louise is on my mind.
[Chorus]
Louise ain't so good looking
And her hair ain't red,
But she cooks my breakfast
And I bring it to my bed.
[Chorus]
Oh Louise, why don't you hurry home?
Oh Louise, why don't you hurry home?
You made me run from Chicago
Oh, to the Gulf of Mexico.
Well, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Lord, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand

Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain
All my love is in vain

When the train pulled up to the station
And I looked her in her eye
When the train pulled up to the station
And I looked her in her eye

I was lonesome, I felt so lonesome
And I could not help but cry
All my love is in vain

Well, the train, it left the station
Two lights on behind
Well, the train, it left the station
With two lights on behind

Well, the blue light was my blues
The red light was my mind
All my love is in vain

Ooh, Willie Mae
Ooh, ooh, Willie Mae
All my love is in vain
I am so in love for once in my life.
In my dreams, I've known you many times before.
And I so want you to be my dear wife,
As only you can satisfy me any more,
And only you can love me more.
[Chorus:]
I'm lovin' you lovin' me lovin' you.
It's all the same; when loving, two together makes one.
Everybody sing la, la la la, la la la, la la la.
It's all the same, and we are one.
I will give you a world of your dreams if you want them.
I can feel the power when you're standing there.
Someone sent me you; oh lord, I will thank him,
And all the rest, it just don't matter,
And all the rest and all the rest.
[Chorus]
Loving you.
You know I love you.
I remember yet before we met
When every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely one.
And I remember meeting you,
Discovering love could be so true
When shared by two, 'stead of only one.
When you said you loved me
We could not be parted.
Said, I built my world around you
And I'm truly glad I found you
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
I never felt so good before.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Yes it has, you know it has.
Each night I pray we'll never part
Because the love within my heart
Grows stronger from day to day.
Best I try, hard I try
To reassure and satisfy.
You know I'd be lost if you went away.
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Yes it has, I know it has.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
I never felt so good before.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Yes it has, you know it has.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Don't you know my baby there.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Whippoorwill's singing
Soft summer breeze
Makes me think of my baby
I left down in New Orleans
I left down in New Orleans

Magnolia, you sweet thing
You're driving me mad
Gotta get back to you, babe
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You whisper "Good morning"
So gently in my ear
I'm coming home to you, baby
I'll soon be there
I'll soon be there

Magnolia, you sweet thing
You're driving me mad
I've gotta get back to you, babe

You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(Ah, gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
My heart was leaping in the sun;
My friends all say that you're the one.
Let me get this one thing very clear:
There ain't enough going on down here.
[Chorus]
Mainline Florida, oh say.
Mainline Florida, O.K.
Her arms were open, open wide;
Her invitation's a changing tide.
I could remember not long ago
We took a cruise down on Hotel Row.
[Chorus]
Her arms were open, open wide;
Her invitation's a changing tide.
I could remember not long ago
We took a cruise down on Hotel Row.
[Chorus]
I keep drinking malted milk,
Trying to drive my blues away.
I keep drinking malted milk,
Trying to drive my blues away.
Baby, you're just as welcome to my loving
As the flowers is in May.
Malted milk, malted milk,
Keep rushing to my head.
Malted milk, malted milk,
Keep rushing to my head.
And I have a funny, funny feeling
And I'm talking all out my head.
Baby, fix me one more drink
And hug your daddy one more time.
Baby, fix me one more drink
And hug your daddy one more time.
Keep on stirring my malted milk, mama,
Until I change my mind.
My doorknob keeps on turning,
There must be spooks around my bed.
My doorknob keeps on turning,
There must be spooks around my bed.
And I have a funny, funny feeling
And the hair's rising on my head.
You say you do when you don't, you say you will when you won't.
You make me laugh make me cry, you make me live make me die.
You put me in put me out, you make me scream make me shout.
You pick me up put me down, you make me king make me clown.
[Chorus]
I'm like a man on fire, a man overboard.
I'm like a man on fire, a man overboard.
You can turn on the light in the middle of the night.
You can put me to rest, what you do is the best.
You can turn me away and get me back the next day.
You can fill up my heart or you can tear it apart.
[Chorus]
You got me so excited you put my heart on overload.
You got my soul ignited, I'm getting ready to explode.
There ain't no early warning for what I'm going through.
I got the fever in the morning because my heart is set on you.
[Chorus]
You're always in my hair, you keep me feeling fine.
I celebrate every time I realize you're really mine
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a man in love,
Yes I'm a man in love.
I tell it everywhere I go,
I want the whole world to know
That I'm a man in love.
I used to be so sad, like a dog without a bone
And then you gave me something baby I had never known.
[Chorus]
I love to see you walk up and down the street,
You look so pretty baby from your head down to your feet.
[Chorus]
Well, the minutes seem like hours, and the hours seem like days
And the days they seem like years every time you go away.
[Chorus]
It's the sugar so sweet,
Kind I'd like to meet
You at midnight
And tell no one else about it.
I'm going to make you mine
'Cause I know we've got the time
Now and then, baby.
Hey, I want you to know,
[Chorus:]
I want to marry you.
Isn't that what you want, too?
I want to marry you.
Isn't that what you want, too?
Come on in the back of the '57.
Let me show you the way, the way to heaven.
You're looking so sweet, yes you are.
I'm sure that you've got some heat.
I've got you on my mind
You know you've got my time
Now and then, baby.
Hey, I want you to know,
[Chorus]
I'm falling in love with you.
You make all my dreams come true.
I'm falling in love with you.
[Chorus: x2]
[Chorus]
May you never lay your head down without a hand to hold.
May you never make your bed out in the cold.
May you never lose your temper if you get hit in a barroom fight.
May you never lose your woman overnight.
Well, you're just like a great, strong sister to me,
And I know that your love is true,
And you hold no blade for to stab me in my back;
I know that there's some that do.
So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind:
Love is a lesson to learn in our time.
Please, won't you please, bear it in mind for me.
[Chorus]
Well, you're just like a great, strong brother to me,
And I know that your love is true,
And you never talk dirty behind my back;
I know that there's some that do.
So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind:
Love is a lesson to learn in our time.
Please, won't you please, bear it in mind for me.
[Chorus]
May you never lose your woman overnight.
May you never lose your woman overnight.
Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door
Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door
And I said, "Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go"

Me and the Devil, was walkin' side by side
Me and the Devil, was walkin' side by side
I'm goin' to beat my woman, until I get satisfied

She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round
Now, baby, you know you ain't doin' me right, now
She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round
It must be that old evil spirit, so deep down in the ground

You may bury my body down by the highway side
I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone
You may bury my body down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit can take the Greyhound bus and ride
Well that mean old dirty Frisco
And that low down Santa Fe.
Mean old Frisco
And that low down Santa Fe.
You know they take my girl away,
Lord, and blow back out on me.
Well my mama, she done told me,
And my papa told me too.
Mama told me
And my papa told me too.
A woman that gets in your face,
Lord she ain't no friend for you.
Well I'm going away now baby
And I won't be back until fall.
Going away, baby.
Lord, I won't be back till fall.
If I don't come back by then,
Lord, I won't be back at all.
Well I'm going away baby
And your crying won't make me stay.
Going away baby
And your crying won't make me stay.
Well the more you cry, little girl,
If anything you'll drive me away.
Well that mean old dirty Frisco
And that low down Santa Fe.
Mean old Frisco
And that low down Santa Fe.
Gonna take my gal away,
Lord, and blow back out on me.
I got a woman, 
Mean as she can be
I got a woman,
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
She kiss so hard, she bruise my lips
Hurts so good, my heart just flips
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
The strangest gal I ever had
Never happy 'less she's mad
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
She makes love without a smile
Ooh, hot dog that drives me wild
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
Put it in your pocket, leave it in your shoe
Plug it in your socket, flush it down the loo
Hey baby, show me something new

Put it in your hat, put it in your can
Feed it to your cat, share it with your band
Hey baby, help me understand

Well they're fighting in the kitchen and they're wagging in the hall
Up against the dark and up against the wall
Why don't you meet me in the bottom baby? Bring your running shoes
Merry Christmas, baby
Oh you sure did treat me right
Oh merry Christmas, baby
Oh you sure did treat me right
You gave me a diamond rings for Christmas
Now I'm living like paradise
I feel lucky this morning 
I got music on my radio
Baby I'm feeling fine this morning 
I got music on my radio
I'd love to hug and kiss you, baby
While you're standing underneath the mistletoe
Santa came down the chimney 
About half past three
Left all these presents 
That you see here for me
Oh merry Christmas, baby
You sure been good to me
And I haven't had a drink this morning 
And I am holding up like a Christmas tree
Santa came down the chimney 
About half past three
Left all these presents 
That you see here for me
Oh merry Christmas, baby
And you sure been good to me 
I'd have a drink this morning
But I feeling like a Christmas tree
Merry Christmas
Tell me, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you?
Ooh, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you?
Now, you have a little calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turnin' blue

Oh, your calf is hungry, I believe he needs a suck
Now, your calf is hungry, I believe he needs a suck
But your milk is turnin' blue, hoo hoo, I believe he's outta luck

Now, I feel like milkin' and my cow won't come
I feel like churnin' it and my milk won't turn
I'm cryin', please, please, don't do me wrong
If you see my milk cow, baby, now how, please, drive her home

But my milkcow been ramblin', hoo hee, for miles around
But my milkcow been ramblin', hoo hoo, for miles around
Well, now how can you suck on some other man's bull cow?
Hoo hoo, in this strange man's town
Don't change your mind,
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder.
I'm doing fine.
If you decide to leave, I won't go under.
You know I've come this far without you
It won't be too hard to be alone.
I've got choices all around me,
So I won't be spending too much time at home.
[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, baby.
I can't forgive you,
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.
No, don't say a word.
I already heard that you don't love me.
In your state of mind,
I don't need to hear your side of the story.
Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know.
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go.
[Chorus]
I broke my back to make you happy.
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care.
If you think you're better off without me,
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there.
[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,
Gonna miss the air you breathe.
I'm just not quite happy, baby,
'bout your crazy plans to leave.
I've been asking some people, if they remember
A girl they forgot, with brown eyes, hair cut, red dress
Have you seen her? I think she's much leaner
I guess she is missing, it's true
She has gone out there somewhere
Disappeared into thin air, I'd just like to find her
I'd like to remind her the good times we had then
More than just good friends, I guess she is missing, it's true
I've been asking around and what I have found
She moved on farther this time
I've been checkin' it out, there ain't no doubt
That woman used to be mine
She is a missing person
She's hidin' away you see
She is a missing person
She's so much lighter than I'll be
She is a missing person
She's got a new rider, she's so much tighter
Missing person
She's hidin' away from me
She up and she left, now she's gone
She didn't even give me a clue
Didn't write me no notes, send me no letters
It's true
She is a missing person, where are you?
A missing person, where are you?
Missing person, hidin' away from me
Missing person, missing person
Missing person, missing person
Missing person
[Chorus:]
She's a modern girl in a modern world
Where only the strong can survive.
Too many dreams have been laid at her door,
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.
Where would you fit in the scheme of her day
And where could you fit in her heart?
Trying to be small will get you nowhere at all,
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.
Don't throw your love away.
Don't throw your love away.
Don't throw your love away.
Don't throw your love away.
She moves through your life like a warm summer breeze,
And nothing will stand in her way.
The sound of her voice brings your heart to its knees,
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.
[Chorus: x2]

And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongoes like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these colour TV's, Lord
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
If I mistreat you girl, I sure don't mean no harm.
If I mistreat you girl, I sure don't mean no harm.
Well, I'm a motherless child; I don't know right from wrong.
Please tell me pretty mama, honey where'd you stay last night?
Please tell me pretty mama, honey where'd you stay last night?
Well, you didn't come home till the sun was shining bright.
I had to go so far girl to get my ham bones boiled.
Had to go so far girl to get my ham bones boiled.
Well, he's had a lot of women, gonna let my ham bones burn.
Well, I did more for you, girl, than your daddy ever done.
Well, I did more for you, girl, than your daddy ever done.
Well, I give you my jelly, he ain't give you none.
And when you see two women, always running hand in hand.
When you see two women, always running hand in hand.
You can bet your bottom dollar, one got the other one's man.
Lord, I'm going to the river, get me a tangled rocking chair.
I'm going to the river, get me a tangled rocking chair.
And if the blues overtake me, gonna rock away from here.
I'm a pawnbroker, what do you want on your ring
I'm a pawnbroker, what do you want on your ring
See like every woman I loaned, they want the same old thing
Have to use my tester and see if will stand the test
Have to use my tester and see if will stand the test
Yes, I'm a pawnbroker, don't have nothing but the best
18 carat is o.k., but 14 carat will make the grade
18 carat is o.k., but 14 carat will make the grade

Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker, I pay the best price in town
Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker, I pay the best price in town
Well, if you don't believe me, baby, just lay your ring down
Yes, you may need money, baby, on your ring some day
Yes, you may need money, baby, on your ring some day
Well, you can't ever tell, what bad luck may come your way
Diamonds of silvery rain in the fountains
And ten-cent red roses from department store counters
Watching the moonlight reflect off the river
Beside where the trains cross the bridge and slow down
Trains with white letters on black iron sides
And white rushing water that all rolls away
And Little Miss Someone does not want to stay
Everyone's moving, with places to go
And Mr Zero - he sadly stands still
As the water goes one way, the train goes another
Mr Zero stands still, and Miss Someone don't bother
Yesterday's kiss will be cold by tomorrow
As campfires of midnight dissolve in the darkness
The room is deserted, the blinds have been drawn
Little Miss Someone has packed up and gone
Fast moving cars disappear down the highway
With signs that say: "hitch-hikers: do not disturb"
Mr Zero looks quietly up from the curb
Morning has faded, and shadows have grown
And Little Miss Someone is on her way home
Mr Zero stands watching - her plane flies above
And with frost-bitten hands waves goodbye to his love
Walks through the park on a bright summer Sunday
And tapestry kittens that hung on the wall
They all die in the air like a soft minor chord
A vacancy sign, and a bulletin board
Mr Zero is wrapping his jacket around him
Speaking kind words that should have been said long ago
But Little Miss Someone does not want to know
The night is deserted, there's dust on the shelf
Mr Zero sits lonely and talks to himself
It's too late to change, the fine line has been crossed
The charades are all done, Mr Zero has lost
Crimson flames tied through my ears, rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads using ideas as my maps
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I, proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth, "rip down all hate," I screamed
Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Girls' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy
To memorizing politics of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now
A self-ordained professor's tongue too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school
"Equality," I spoke the word as if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now
Me and my children
Together once in a while
We go walking and talking
Seeing them smile and
Run and play
Reading their minds
Ever growing wiser
What to do
We'll go to the zoo
Right now

Lions and tigers are eating
Don'tcare that we stand and see
As we pass by their bars to the next attraction
The horses the birds in their cages
Such a shame thay can't be free
Like me and my children

Me and my children
So happy in the times that we ride in the day
And at night there's always a meal and a show
And then we go to the point where we say
Farewell to remember
When I go my love stays
With the children
Sailing down behind the sun, 
Waiting for my prince to come. 
Praying for the healing rain 
To restore my soul again. 
Just a toe rag on the run. 
How did I get here? 
What have I done? 
When will all my hopes arise? 
How will I know him? 
When I look in my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
When I look in my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
Then the light begins to shine 
And I hear those ancient lullabies. 
And as I watch this seedling grow, 
Feel my heart start to overflow. 
Where do I find the words to say? 
How do I teach him? 
What do we play? 
Bit by bit, I've realized 
That's when I need them, 
That's when I need my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
That's when I need my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
Then the jagged edge appears 
Through the distant clouds of tears. 
I'm like a bridge that was washed away; 
My foundations were made of clay. 
As my soul slides down to die. 
How could I lose him? 
What did I try? 
Bit by bit, I've realized 
That he was here with me; 
I looked into my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
I looked into my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
I looked into my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes.
Hang on sloopy,

Improvisation
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
I got something more to say to you,
Little sloopy blue.
I want to say 
Hang on sloopy.
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine,
My valentine

As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine,
My valentine

And I will love her, for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly

And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon
The sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there
This love of mine,
My valentine

What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun is gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine,
My valentine
My very good friend the milkman says
That I've been losing to much sleep
He doesn't like the hours I keep
And he suggests that you should marry me
My very good friend the mailman says
That it would make his burden less
If we both had the same address
And he suggests that you should marry me.
Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views
My very good friends the neighbors say
That they've been watching little things I do
And they perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me.
(Sir Walter Richmond)
(Sir Allan Touissaint)
Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views
And my very good friends the neighbors say
That they've been watching little things I do
And they perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me.
Hey comes the bride, all fat and wide...
You left him standing in the pouring rain.
There's every chance he'll go insane.
And someone comes along and takes his hand.
He must have love, can't you understand, that
[Chorus:]
He needs his woman,
He needs his woman,
And he needs his woman,
He needs his woman to love.
His hands are shaking and his head hangs down.
No peace of mind for him is found.
Break his heart and then you'll set him free.
Someone must save him, just you wait and see, but
[Chorus]
What will it take till you believe his love is real? 
Nobody said he had to love you, now he always will.
He'll walk that lonely road again today.
The love he gave you, you threw away.
When all he wanted was a hand to hold.
His lonely world has grown so cold, and
[Chorus: x2]
It's so easy loving you
With everything I feel inside,
And holding me the way you do,
It's here I'm staying all of my life.
[Chorus:]
I'll never ever make you cry.
I'll never ever say goodbye.
Can't you see it in my eyes?
I'm yours until the day I die.
I'll watch you fall asleep at night,
I'll smile and kiss you, hold you tight,
I'll hold your hand and close my eyes,
It's here I'm staying all of my life.
[Chorus: x2]
If you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
Yes you do.
Well, if you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
They got such pretty little girls in that big town,
Make a man want to jump around and shout.
I met a little girl there,
She was about five foot eight.
I said "I want you to love me."
She said "Why man, that'd be great."
So,
I got long hair but,
She took me back,
Back to see her pad,
But the first thing I saw when I arrived there,
Was a big black shiny shotgun,
In the hands of her dad.
Alright now, this is how it was,
Oh no!
Well alright!
I finally learned my lesson,
Such a long time ago,
Next little woman that I date,
I've got to know, I've got to know her family too.
Yes indeed, I gotta know her family too.
But if you don't want to be filled full of shotgun holes,
Mister, this song is just for you.
When the evenin' sun goes down
You will find me hangin' 'round
The night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life
Many people just like me
Dreamin' of old used-to-be's
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
Ah, but it's my life
Listen to the blues that they're playin'
Listen what the blues are sayin'
Life is just another scene
In this old world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
Oh, but it's my life
Listen to what the blues are saying
Life is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
And the night life ain't no good life
but its my life
the night life ain't no good life
but, it's my life
Well, I wish I was a catfish,
Swimmin in a oh, deep, blue sea
I would have all you good lookin women,
Fishin, fishin after me
Sure 'nough, a-after me
Sure 'nough, a-after me
Oh 'nough, oh 'nough, sure 'nough

I went to my baby's house,
And I sit down oh, on her steps
She said, "C'mon in now, Muddy
You know, my husband just now left
Sure 'nough, he just now left
Sure 'nough, he just now left
Oh Lord, oh well, oh well

Well, my mother told my father,
Just before hmmm, I was born,
"I got a boy child's comin',
Gonna be, he gonna be a rollin' stone,
Sure 'nough, he's a rollin' stone
Sure 'nough, he's a rollin' stone"
Oh well he's a, oh well he's a, oh well he's a

Well, I feel, yes I feel,
Feel that I could lay down oh, time ain't long

Back, back down the road I'm goin'
Back down the road I'm goin'

You know if you don't want me little girl

Oh, sad, sad day

I'm about to lose my doggone mind
Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long

Alright, alright.
Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen right here, 
Right here I want to tell you a little story.
This is about a country boy from down home.
This young man has never been north before.
I want you to listen to me, I got something to tell
You.
He heard about Chicago.
He worked hard over here, made all of that money, 800
Dollars.
After caring for his crop, he called his cousin in
Chicago, 
And he said, "Cousin, I'm on my way".
He picked all of that cotton.
I said this is about a country boy like myself, B.B.
King you know.
So when he get to Chicago, his cousin meet him and
Bring him out to the club.
He said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for.
Had all the go-go girls set up, waitin' up.
They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the
Pleasure hotels.
They brought him back out and said, "Set him up!", 
Cous's payin' for.
His money got a little lighter, they lured him out from
The Lute and brought him down to Robert's.
And then he said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for.
And then the 800 dollars, bein' more money then my man
Had ever had, began to run out.
Then they moved him out and put him down with the... 
And then, ladies and gentlemen, the go-go girls would
Get fewer.
His friends was fewer.
All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other
Side of the street.
And then it happened all his buddies were gone.
And my man knew only one thing to do, it was getting
Cold there, like it is today, 
You know what I'm talking about.
He went down to the railroad yard, 
And one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent
His money, came by to see him.
And she said "You fool!, you fool!", I wouldn't have
Spend your money, but the rest of them was spending
Your money so I decided to spend my portion too, you
Know.
But ladies, God bless 'em, wonderful something's aren't
They?.

Knew my man needed her bad.

Down in Mississippi, I knew a blind man. 
This is what he told me, when I tried to lend a hand. 
I go by feel, yes, I go by feel. 
The only way I know what's real, I go by feel.
People always ask me about the blues I play. 
I say it just comes through me, I don't know no other way. 
I go by feel, I go by feel. 
The only way I know what's real, 
Hey, I go by feel.
Sometimes it seems like a mystery, 
I just close my eyes and it comes to me. 
There's somethin' I don't even understand. 
I just open my heart and it flows right through my hand.
Listen to it.
When I'm with a woman, and I wonder if there's love,
All the proof I need is right there in her touch. 
I go by feel, the only way I know what's real, 
Hey, I go by feel. 
I go by feel. 
People, I go by feel. 
The only way I know if it's real, 
Hey, I go by feel.
Go by feel, go by feel

Stoned on the stoop, got the box pumpin' Billy Joel
I'm Mickey Mantle while you motherfuckers semi-pro
Neck to colon how a slice from the machete go
Shoot your gun and throw confetti 'cause I'm ready ho!
Look in my eyes, you can tell that I'm a stand-up
Call me the teacher, wanna talk just put your hands up
We eat the lamb, duck, goose, beef or chicken
Two seater shiftin' with the smooth Cedar Strippin'
My facial hair is light red just like a ball of fire
Golden sound, blow the town, 'lo attire
Brown haze leather swampy like the Everglades
I'll switch a style so that I'm ready when the era change
First pressed virgin oil from the Greek Border
Spit the shit that have me laid up with the sheik's daughter
Three quarter on the Bally jacket to the knee
Lights flashin' when I'm rappin', tappin' tree
That smoke lingers son it shine through the curtain
Cracked pepper motherfucker I'mma grinder for certain
So never in your life come with scared business here
Fuck around never found bitch, disappear
Time after time I'm a winner
Seasoned in the barrel, harvest in the winter
Far from a beginner, keep an extra cartridge in the denim
Twisted off of Manischewitz, Harlem in a rental
The hash tanner than Connie, gorgeous
360 is the ways and the caesar's huggin' knotty flosses
Never stop until we hoppin out of grimey Porsches
One night shorty needin' over 9 abortions
I'm the whole shit, one you wanna roll with
When in canoe waving the ganja like a glow stick
Number one, numero uno with the flow shit
Your style is tired and limp just like an old dick
Bitch
Roman sculptures, all of my students hold a diploma
Stairs to the bath, garage door, behold the Lotus
Finest tuna right out the sea straight off the boat this
Hurricane rap spit tap low, rock a toga
Bronsonelli chef de cuisine I flex the two seam
Inject the vein with marijuana I'm a true fiend

That's hidden inside the rented, the window tinted ten the percentage
Sacrificin' the lamb for the nutrition

Nuclear fission is heavy weighty top the division
Lots of provisions collosal status stoppin' collisions
Too beaucoup, fresher than a lake trout
Barbecue the venison, pair it with a great stout
Peace I'm out kid, a motherfucker pace out
Every time I take that motherfuckin' weapon from my waist out
I've got dreams, dreams to remember

Honey, I saw you there last night
Another man's arms holding you tight
Nobody knows what I feel inside
All I know, I walked away and cried

Mindin' my own bus'ness,
when the ticket man calls my name
Yeah, yeah, babe
There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
Comin' down the line
So I say, "If it ain't too much trouble,
when's the local out of town?"
His reply: "Two a.m."
If I'm leavin' local-bound
I can catch it in forty minutes,
if I want to grab the express
But the local trains are hard to come by,
this time of night, more or less
Listen, said
There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
Comin' down the line
So I stood for forty minutes,

Yeah, yeah
He said

I hate to even think about, yeah
Another man snoring in my baby's face
Don't change your mind,
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder.
I'm doing fine.
If you decide to leave, I won't go under.
You know I've come this far without you
It won't be too hard to be alone.
I've got choices all around me,
So I won't be spending too much time at home.
[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, baby.
I can't forgive you,
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.
No, don't say a word.
I already heard that you don't love me.
In your state of mind,
I don't need to hear your side of the story.
Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know.
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go.
[Chorus]
I broke my back to make you happy.
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care.
If you think you're better off without me,
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there.
[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,
Gonna miss the air you breathe.
I'm just not quite happy, baby,
'bout your crazy plans to leave.

But you can keep them for the birds and bees

But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

A man in Louisiana
He never called me by my name
He said "boy do this and boy do that"
But I never once complained
I knew he had a good heart
But he just didn't understand
That I needed to be treated
Just like any other man
[Chorus]
I sat my little child down
When he was old enough to know
I said I fell in this big wide world
You're gonna be all kinda froze

That you treat everybody just the way
You want them to treat you

Tramp.
You didn't!
You don't wear continental clothes, or Stetson hats.

Matter of opinion.
That's all right, Mama was. Papa too. And I'm the only child. Lovin' is all I know to do.
You know what, Otis?

All that stuff. And I'm the only son-of-a-gun this side of the Sun. Tramp!
You know what, Otis? I don't care what you say, you're still a tramp.
What?
That's right. You haven't even got a fat bankroll in your pocket.

Ooooooohhh, I'm a lover. Mama was. Papa too. I tell you one thing.
Well tell me.
I'm the only son-of-a-gun this side of the sun.
You're a tramp, Otis.

What's wrong with that?
Look here. You ain't got no money.
I got everything.
You can't buy me all those minks and sables and all that stuff I want.
I can buy you minks, rats, frogs, squirrels, rabbits, anything you want, woman.
Look, you can go out in the Georgia woods and find them, Baby.
Oh, you foolin'.
You're still a tramp.
That's all right.
You a tramp, Otis. You just a tramp.
That's all right.
You wear overalls. You need a haircut, baby.

"Ladies. I said ladies ladies if you got a man and the man don't do like you think he
Should ladies you don't hurt 'im. I said don't you hurt him! Man happens to be
God's gift to women! So ladies you must know that the man is already grown so you can't
Raise him over again
So the thing to do is throw your arms around him! Hold him close to
You! Look him straight in the eyes! And then you tell him you tell him, you
Say "now baby you been messing up, but I know you gonna do me better." and when he
Look at you as if he wanna know when, then you tell him "someday baby." and if it seem
Like he's hard of hearing or not paying you much attention or something do like you ladies
Are known to do put your hands on your hips and then you say it again ow! He have to
Be a mighty hard hearted person not to listen to you
But I don't think it's fair to just talk to the ladies, I think I should say a few words to the
Men too. So fellas I said fellas! Fellas if you got a woman and the lady don't do like
You think she should
Don't you be goin' upside of her head now. You know what I'm talkin' about, don't you be
Beatin' on her. The judgment's much cheaper if you don't beat her. And you see if you hurt
Her you only do one thing I said if you hurt her you only do one thing! You make her a little
Smarter and she won't let you catch her the next time. So the thing to do is throw your
Arms around the pretty little thing! Now listen to me, listen to me I don't care if she
Weigh thirty-two and a half pounds wet or five hundred and fifty pounds on her feet. If she's
Your lady and you dig her, than she's your pretty little thing and then you tell
Her! You say "baby! Baby I don't care what they say about you on the next block, your
My little lady and I dig you. Let em talk, let 'em say what they want to say"
And fellas, you must know too that the ladies, god bless their sweet little souls, ladies
Happen to be god's gift to man too fellas. You all agreed? You better say it cause your wife
Is listening. But there's just one more thing I must say to you fellas, just one more thing
Don't be too proud to beg. I said don't be too proud to beg! If you have to fall
Down on your knees to let your woman know that you love her, go on down there
I can see some of you cats got dirty minds in the place this evening what I'm tryin'
To say, ladies love to hear their men say "baby I love you!" don't
You ladies? I said ladies love to hear their men say "baby I love you!"
Don't you ladies? So fellas tell your lady that you love her! She might
Think you're lying though. Tell your lady that you love her even if you are
Lying
But seriously speaking, when I goof, when I goof I usually slide up to my woman and I look
Straight at her I have to get my look first I usually say I look like a little puppy begging
For that last bone you been holding out on. I look straight at her and I say "baby! Please
Forgive me honey!" and then I wait a few minutes to see how she take it. And then I
Say "baby! Please forgive me honey!" and then I stand back far enough so that when
She swings I can duck and then I say "baby! You know when I goofed last week I
Was high "if she let me get away with that then I look at her real pitiful like this say
"Baby, honey you know when you're high it don't count. " And then I tell her, I say
"If you forgive me honey I'm gonna do better." And if she look at me as if she wanna know
When then I tell her "someday baby "
Yes someday, baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins

That I got the crossroad blues this mornin', Lord, babe, I'm sinkin' down
And I went to the crossroad, mama, I looked east and west
I went to the crossroad, baby, I looked east and west
Lord, I didn't have no sweet woman, ooh well, babe, in my distress
I'm a drunken-hearted man, my life seems so misery
I'm a poor drunken-hearted man, my life seems so misery
And if I could only change my way of livin', it would mean so much to me
I been dogged and I been driven ever since I left my mother's home
I been dogged and I been driven ever since I left my mother's home
And I can't see the reason why, that I can't leave these no-good women's alone
My poor father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she could
My poor father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she could
Every man love that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no good
I'm the poor drunken-hearted man and sin was the cause of it all
I'm the poor drunken-hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all
But the day that you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that you surely fall
From four till late, I was wringin' my hands and cryin'
From four till late, I was wringin' my hands and cryin'
I believe to my soul, that your daddy's Gulfport-bound
From Memphis to Norfolk, is a thirty-six hours ride
From Memphis to Norfolk, is a thirty-six hours ride
A man is like a prisoner and he's never satisfied
A woman is like a dresser, some man always ramblin' through its drawers

It cause so many men, wear an apron overall
From four till late, she get with a no-good bunch and clown

Now, she won't do nothin', but tear a good man' reputation down
When I leave this town, I'm gon' bid you fare, farewell
And when I leave this town, I'm gon' bid you fare, farewell
And when I return again, you'll have a great long story to tell
"one night while sleeping in my bed I had a beautiful dream
That all the people of the world got together on the same wavelength
And began helping one another
Now in this dream, universal love was the theme of the day
Peace and understanding and it happened this way"
The sick, the hungry, had smiles on their faces
The tired and the homeless had family all around
The streets and the cities were all beautiful places
And the walls came tumblin' down
People of the world all had it together
Had it together for the boys and the girls
And the children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away
I had a vision of blue skies from sea to shining sea
All the trees in the forest stood strong and tall again
Everything was clean and pretty and safe for you and me
The worst of enemies became the best of friends
People of the world all had it together
Had it together for the boys and the girls
Children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away
Remember that, remember that
Remember that, remember that
People of the world all had it together
Had it together for the boys and the girls
Children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away
Caught up in a whirlwind can't catch my breath
Knee deep in hot water broke out in a cold sweat
Can't catch a turtle in this rat race
Feels like I'm losin' time at a breakneck pace
Afraid of my own shadow in the face of grace
Heart full of darkness spotlight on my face
There was love all around me but I was lookin' for revenge
Thank God it never found me would have been the end
(I was) walkin' the tightrope steppin' on my friends
Walkin' the tightrope (it) was a shame and a sin
Walkin' the tightrope between wrong and right
Walkin' the tightrope both day and night
Lookin' back in front of me in the mirror's a grin
Through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend
We've all had our problems that's the way life is
My heart goes out to others who are there to make amends
We've been walkin' the tightrope tryin' to make it right
Walkin' the tightrope every day and every night
Walkin' the tightrope bring it all around
Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found
Walkin' the tightrope stretched around the world
Walkin' the tightrope save the boys and girls
Walkin' the tightrope let's make it right
Walkin' the tightrope do it do it tonight
Walkin' the tightrope
Went down to tin pan alley, see what was going on
Things was too hot down there, couldn't stay very long
Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there, livin' for their whiskey, wine, and gin
I heard a woman scream, yeah and I peeked through the door
Some cat was workin' on Annie with a, Lord with a two-by-four
Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there, livin' for their whiskey, wine, and gin
I saw a cop standin', with his hand on his gun
Said "this is a raid boys, nobody run"
Hey, hey, hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries

I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
I'm a mess without my, little China Girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes
My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth

So long, baby
Hope we'll meet again
If you ever in trouble
Just remember I'm your friend

Give me back my wig, honey let your head go bald
Give me back my wig, honey let your head go bald
You really had no business, honey buyin' no wig at all
Give me back that wig, honey let your head go bald
Give me back that wig, honey let your head go bald

Well I'm going down
Down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down
Down, down, down, down, down
I've got my head out the window
And my big feet on the ground
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I've got my head out the window
And my big feet on the ground
So I'm going down
Down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, yes I am
I've got my head out the window
And my big feet on the
Well I'm goin
Down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down
Down, down, down, down, down
I've got my head out the window
And my big feet on the ground
Gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I've got my head out the window
And my big feet on the
Well I'm Down
Down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down
Down, down, down, down, down
I've got my head out the window
And my big feet on the ground, yes I have
Well she walked out the door
And I crawled right out there
Suck it up, going down
30 seconds till we smash into the ground
Passengers, have lost their smiles
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train
Another day, another flight
There's not a chance of going down
But then we just might, so this is it, this is goodbye
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train
Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
But I'm going nowhere
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
And I really don't care
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train
We're going down, we're out of sky
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind
I try to reach her, but she's not there
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
I ease the seat back and start to pray
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What'd you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul, baby
I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but
Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue
I can't explain, no, I can't explain
You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain
I'm leavin' you woman....before i commit some crime
I'm leavin' you woman....before i commit a crime
You the evilest woman....i think ever crossed my mind
You put poison in my coffee....instead of milk or cream
You poison my coffee....in with that milk and cream
You're the meanest woman....i think i've most ever seen
You mix my drink....with a can of red devil lye
You mix my drink....with a can of red devil lye
Then you sit right down....watchin' me....hopin' i might die
You better be watchin' me baby....baby it was not my time
You better be watchin' me baby....just might be your time
Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"
Boy
Thanks for hesitating

You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams

You'll buy it secondhand
You'll get up and sleep

I picked up the extension and I heard every word you say
Why don't you just go, man and leave my little girl alone

A girl like you would just love to make a fool of me
Let me love you baby....let me love you baby
Let me love you little darlin'....let me love you baby

Let's dance 
Let's dance

Put on your red shoes and dance the blues 
Let's dance 
To the song they're playing on the radio 
Let's sway 
While color lights up your face 
Let's sway 
Sway through the crowd to an empty space 
If you say run, I'll run with you 
If you say hide, we'll hide 
Because my love for you 
would break my heart in two 
If you should fall into my arms 
And tremble like a flower 
Let's dance 
Let's dance 
Let's dance 
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance 
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway 
Under the moonlight this serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you 
And if you say hide, we'll hide 
Because my love for you 
would break my heart in two 
If you should fall into my arms 
And tremble like a flower 
Let's dance

Put on your red shoes and dance the blues

Hello there my old friend
Not so long ago it was till the end
We played outside in the pourin' rain
On our way up the road we started over again
You're livin' out dreams of you on top
My mind is achin' oh lord it won't stop
That's how it happened livin' life by the drop
Up and down that road in our worn out shoes
Talkin' 'bout good things and singin' the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter or time
You're livin' out dreams of you on top
My mind is achin' oh lord it won't stop
That's how it happened life by the drop
No waste of time we're allowed today
Churnin' up the past, there's no easier way
Times been between us, a means to an end
God its good to be here walkin' together my friend
Livin' our dreams
My mind stopped achin'
That's how it happened livin' life by the drop
That's how it happened livin' life by the drop
That's how it happened livin' life by the drop
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on Amerika's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the norfolk broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey mama look at little sis
Out in the backyard, playin' like this

"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
Till you come
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
Till you come
(Waiting so long, ahhh...)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) (repeat ad inf.)

Mary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow, yeah
And everywhere the child went
That little lamb was sure to go now
He followed her to school one day
Which broke the teachers cool
But what a time did they have
That day at school
Tisket! Tasket! baby
A green and yellow basket
I sent a letter to my baby
And on my way I past it
Now, this tune should be easy for you to deal with
All you gotta do is remember back home,
You know what I mean
When you was sitting out behind the house
Or practicing on your own guit feble
Tryin' to get things together,
And you couldn't make up your mind
Kinda half-way knew what you wanted to do
But you didn't have it all together
But you did know you wanted to travel
(That's right!)
Yeah, I remember those days real good
(I know)
Didn't have really many clothes
Didn't know nobody to call to sing for you
So you had to get out there in no time, you know
(so)
You don't make no tiffanies, you say
"I'm goin'...
And I know I got a great time, but I'm goin' anyway"
Whatever happens
(What happens?)
I gotta pay my dues somewhere
Listen:
Dreamed that I was lucky,
But I woke up cold in hand
Hey, I dreamed that I was lucky, darling,

But now I know you found you another man
Oh, that's why I wonderin'

Ooh
They were two lonely folks doin' the do's and don'ts
And got the notion together they'd be happy
Thought they'd lose the crowd 'n' do the mess around
Decided to make it snappy
Just a twist of fate they didn't hesitate
Now they had another party to lean on
She made him jump and sang he made her share that thang
Looks like they gonna have a ball ain't nothin' wrong at all
Wo they gonna have a ball
They got to askin' what if they had to scratch-n-sniff
To find out what it is they are after
Got the ants out their pants 'n' took the chance on romance
Made some plans to make it forever
Now several years have gone they still gettin' along
They know what true love is made of
Now they know that life's a trip with all it's bumps and dips
They gonna help one another along
Nothin' wrong at all still havin' a ball
Lord they really gettin' it on
Time is on their side they got nothin' to hide
Never had no secrets between them
He don't need to accuse her, use her or abuse her
And she feels the same for him
And those vows they made said nothin' 'bout slaves
And didn't mention rentin' to own
They can take the stand that walkin' hand in hand
What they got is gooder than gold
Ain't nothin' wrong at all wo they gonna have a ball
Yeah they really got it all
Love is true heart's desire without it's just a funeral pyre
Got to let your true love grow it's all you got that's gooder than gold

Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that 
He tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star
[CHORUS (x2)]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation 
As a rock & roll star
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like 
A regular superstar
I could fall asleep at night 
As a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right 
As a rock & roll star
Very superstitious, writing on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass 
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way 
Very superstitious, wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song 
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeh, yeh 
Very superstitious, nothin' more to say
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, no, no, no
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman
If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet.
Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman
Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes

Born under a bad sign
Been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
Wouldn't have no luck at all
Bad luck and trouble
Been my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten
Born under a bad sign
Been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for real bad luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
The morning is dead
And the day is, too
There's nothing left here to meet me
But the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's like a little more than enough
To make a man throw himself away

And I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Alone

Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust
That makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Lord, alone

Loneliness is such a drag

So here I sit to face
That same old fire place
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion
Goin' through my mind
And soon enough time will tell,
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone to toll my bell

And I continue
To burn this old lamp
Lord, alone
Darlin' can't ya hear me callin' you?
So lonely
Gonna have to blow my mind
Lonely

Swimin' in the, the deep blue sea

Come all you good time people
While I've got money to spend
Tomorrow might be Monday 
And I'd neither have a dollar nor a friend 
Well I've got plenty of money in my pocket
My good time friends are around 
But as soon as my pocketbook is empty
Not a friend on this earth can be found 
I wrote my little woman a letter good people
And I told her I was in jail
She sent me back an answer
Sayin honey I'm a coming go your bail
But I'm still walking round 
This old jail house this evening
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn whiskey has surrounded my body poor boy
And my woman is troubling my mind
Lord my daddy told me a pretty good people
And my momma she told me more
Said son if you don't quit your rowdy ways
You'll have trouble at your door
If it wasn't for heartaches and trouble good people
Lord I would not be here today
I will ramble this whole world over
At home I cannot stay
Give me corn bread
On the table when I'm hungry
Something tall and cool when I'm dry
And a true loving woman to stand by me
Sweet heaven when I die
Go dig a hole in the meadow good people
Make it deep in that cold cold ground
Then gather around all you kind friends 
And see this poor rounder go down
And when I'm dead and they buried me
With my pale face turned to the sun
Will you stand around and moan little woman
And think of the way you have done
Yeah,
Um ah um ah
I got a good reason, for taken the easy way out
I got a good reason, for taken the easy way out now

She's a big teaser

Oh, help me in my weakness
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the court room 
And were taking him away
Well, my trip hasn't been a pleasant one
And my time it isn't long
And I still do not know 
What is was that I've done wrong
Well the judge he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
Well you fail to understand, he said
Why must you even try
Outside the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more, more, more
Cried for more, cried for more
Hey you better leave that boy's soul alone
Oh stop that passing the jury
Grab me a tendon and me a nurse
Oh, the trial was bad enough
Yes, but this is ten times worse
Just then bolt of lightning
Showed the court house out of shape
And while everybody knelt to pray
The drifter made his escape
The drifter did his escape
Yeah
So long
Every since the first time I lay eyes upon you
You don't know how hard it is to let you go
Even in the first when we were started
I told you man was here to live but he had to go
So you killed jesus
You killed Abraham too
You killed Martin
What you here to do

That theey all left behind
Oh you make it hurt so bad
Why you make it hurt so bad

Get out my eyes teardrops

Well, I saw her...she was walkin' down the street
She was looking mighty tasty...she was looking so good to me
So I walked up to her with my very best smile on my face
She just kinda laughed and said "are you through?
Can we get on, can we get on down to your place."
She come to my house
She come up my stairs
She tell me she need me
She look like she cares
She make me feel good
She make me feel good all night
She make me feel good
She make me feel all right
I said "baby...what's your name? "
I said "baby...what's your name? "

And she said g...l...o...r...i-i-i-i-i-i-a
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)
You know, I saw her again...the very next day
She was walkin' on that same strip of road
And she was headin' my way
Now, I'll never forget the night before
In fact, I'll never forget that week
But there I sat, motionless, somber, silent, unable to speak
You see, to my sorrow, and to my shame
In all the excitement, I'd forgotten this girl's name
I said "baby...what's your name? "
I said "baby...what's your name? "
And she said g...l...o...r...i-i-i-i-i-i-a
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk
Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one
Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else
Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do
Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside
When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause
Sugar Pie Honey Bunch you know that I'm weak for you
Can't help myself I love you and nobody else
Sugar Pie Honey Bunch do anything you ask me to
Can't help myself I want you and nobody else
Sugar Pie Honey Bunch you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Can't help myself, no I can't help myself
(I Feel Good)
Oh
[Chorus]
I feel good
I knew that I would now
I feel good
I knew that I would now
So good, so good, I got you!
Oh
I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, 'cause I Got You
When I hold you in my arms
I know I can't do no wrong now
When I hold you in my arms
My love can't do me no harm
[Chorus]
When I hold you in my arms
I know I can't do no wrong now
When I hold you in my arms
My love can't do me no harm
[Chorus]
So good, So good, 'Cause I got you
So good, So good, 'Cause I got you
Hey Yeah
I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her"
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Oo baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey
Oo wee baby, my baby loves me
My baby needs me
Hey, hey, hey
Oo my baby loves me
Well, I'll Be Doggone if I would work all day
And I'll Be Doggone if I would bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around,
blowing my money all over this town
Then I wouldn't be doggone 
Hey, Hey!  I'd be long gone.
Then I wouldn't be doggone (Baby!)
I'd be long gone. mm mm
Now, hey, hey, hey!
 
I'll be Doggone if you ain't a pretty thing
And I'll be Doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring
And if we live to be a hundred year old,
if you ever let that spring turn cold
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey, Hey!  I'd be long gone.
Oh, I wouldn't be doggone (Baby)
I'd be long gone.  mm mm
Now, did you hear me?
Well, now, what I say oh, believe me.
 
Well, ev'ry woman should try to be whatever her man wants her to be.
And I don't want much, all I want from you is for you to be true to me.
 
I'll be Doggone if love ain't a man's best friend
Oh, baby, And I'll Be Doggone if you ain't the loving end
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could, 
if I ever found out that you're no good 
Then I wouldn't be doggone 
Well, I wouldn't be doggone (Baby!)
I'd be long gone.
I wouldn't be doggone 
(gonna catch me a train)
Naw, baby, I wouldn't be doggone
I wouldn't be doggone 
(gonna catch me a plane)
Now when I was a little boy,
At the age of five,
I had somethin' in my pocket,
Keep a lot of folks alive.
Now I'm a man,
Made twenty-one,
You know baby,
We can have a lot of fun.
I'm a man,

The way I make love to 'em,
They can't resist.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the Jimi Hendrix experience"
"I see that we meet again hmmm. Yeah well, well, well. Dig
Dig, I'd like to get something strait, we umm we got tired
Of the experience, and every once in a while we're blowing
Our minds too much, so we decided to change everything around
And a call it 'gypsy sons and rainbows' for short nothin' but
A band of gypsies. We have billy cox playin' bass, and um from
Nashville Tennessee we have lary lee playin' guitar over there
We got juma playin' congos over there, juma, and we have granny
Goose, oh I'm sorry Mitch Mitchell on drums over there, and we
Got jerry velez on congos too. You got yours truly on Pete Whistle
What me worry? Gives us about a minute and a half to tune up ok
Like we only had about two rehearsals so a we'll only do a primary
Rhythm thing, I have mine thank you
I have mine thank you, baby"
Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Livin' in a cottage made of earth and wood,
Lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell.

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, strummin' his guitar in the gentle shade,
Playing to the music that the drivers made.
People passing by they'd stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode

His mama told him ?someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
All kinds a people coming from miles around
To hear ya play ya guitar 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you
Peopled called you, said 'beware the doll, you're bound to fall',
You thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody else that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
In no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
What do you think you'll do then
I bet they shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Purple haze, all in my brain
Lately things they don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

Wait a minute, something's wrong, lord, have mercy
This key won't unlock this door,
Something's goin' on here
I have a bad bad feeling
That my baby don't live her no more
Well, I might as well go back over yonder,
Way back up on the hill
That's something to do
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder,
Way back yonder cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will
Yeah

She walks with a bell-clock round her neck
So the hippies think she's in with time
Time
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck
Branches attack me from her neck

She's so fine
She's so very very fine

The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind
Mind
Morning sign sounds just like a lock
All these signs are always a stock

She's so fine
She's so very very fine

When I veer I get so near
But so far far far away
Listen to me, today

We united just beside a leaf
The ground was hard underneath her

Ahhhahhh
She's so fine
Ahhhahhh

Oh uh
I see fingers, hands and shades of faces
Reachin' up and not quite touchin' the promised land
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper sayin'
Oh, Lord, please give us a helpin' hand
Yeah yeah
Way down in the background
I can see frustrated souls of cities burnin'
And all across the water, baby
I see weapons barkin' out the sting of death
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFOs jumpin' themselves
Laughin' they sayin'
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess
Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink
I can't really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor
But as far as I know, they may even try 
To wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me
Brother sell me, and don't worry about lookin' at the score
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me-e, yeah
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
Darlin', darlin', stand by me-e, stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
O say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say does that star spangled banner yet wave
For the land of the free
And the home of the brave?
Everyday in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog
Talkin' about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

Hey!
And that's why
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be down I gotta move on
Ah

Stone free to do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free I can't stay
I got to got to got to get away right now

Alright
Listen to this baby
A woman here a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
But sometimes I get a ha
Feel my heart kind of runnin' hot
That's when I've got to move before I get caught

Hey that's why, listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down

I told you man was here to live but he had to go
So you killed jesus
You killed Abraham too
You killed Martin
What you here to do
Now we're gonna play you the feelings
That theey all left behind
Oh you make it hurt so bad
Why you make it hurt so bad
Take everything I had
Everything I had

It's getting near dawn,
When lights close their tired eyes.
I'll soon be with you my love,
To give you my dawn surprise.
I'll be with you darling soon,
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love.
I'm with you my love,
The light's shining through on you.
Yes, I'm with you my love,
It's the morning and just we two.

The things that I used to do, lord, I won't do no more
I said, the things that I used to do, yeah I won't do no more
I used to  run and hold your hand babe and cry, oh babe do not go? 
I used to search all night for you babe
All my search would always end in vain
I used to search all night for you 
Lord all my search would always end in vain
But I knew all the time babe that you was hid out wit' your other man
Gonna leave you all lonely, baby
Try somewhere else, love one more time
Gonna leave you home baby
Try somewhere else, love one more time
The way you mistreat me child, I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Turn off your mind relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.
Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving
So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Well, I came upon a child of god
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "where are you going?"
And this he told me
I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I got to get back to the land
And set my soul free
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
Though can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Now maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden, alright 
Oh back to the garden oh now
Gonna back, going back, gonna back to the garden

The same cigarettes as me

There must be some kind of way outta here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Business men, they drink my wine
Plowman dig my earth
None were level on the mind
Nobody up at his word
Hey, hey
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late, hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And auld lang syne?
(Repeat)
Peoples, peoples, peoples
You know what it means to be left alone
Peoples, peoples, people
You know what it means to be left alone

Lord it happened to day
Lord not even a call on my telephone
Understandin'
Lord a little love in the world is all I need 
A little love and understanding baby
It's all in the world I need
Lose of love
A misunderstanding of a no good woman
Lord they've both caused my heart to bleed
All right
Every mornin'
Every mornin' the willows weep among for me
Every mornin' yes the willows weep among for me
The birds sang the love song
My baby's caused my heart to bleed
You'll never know I cried
When I found out you lied
For I've been hiding all these teardrops in my heart
My eyes dare not reveal
The way I really feel
Because I know I'll cry my heart out if I start
(If I start)
Though I'm pretending
That I don't care
To be with you, my darling, is my prayer
(Is my prayer)
But way down deep inside
I can't give up my pride
So I'll just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart
(In my heart)
But way down deep inside
I can't give up my pride
So I'll just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart

Some people cry the blues, I never could
I had no time for tears, life was too good
I had the brightest smile in town, oh yeah
Till you came along, and you turned it upside down.
Everything went my way, life was a ball
But then you came along and changed it all
You took the brightest smile in town,
Yeah you took it baby, and you turned it upside down
You brought me love, oh tender love
That made my whole world glow
And then you took it all away

You took it baby, and you turned it upside down
Baby, whoa, yeah baby, you turned it upside down.
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!
He came witht the name Cincinnati
A kid with no ace in the hole
On a hot poker pot, Cincinnati
Had staked his heart and soul
He played night and day like a demon
And prayed for that one lucky day
When the lush royal flush of his dreaming
Is just a game away
Beyond all the green felt shadows
His own queen of hearts will wait
But till he's king of the green felt shadows
She'll wait, and wait, and wait
For sure as the cards will be falling
And chips in the pot, he'll remain
For the book Lady Luck will be calling
Whoah, the Cincinnati kid
I mean the Cincinnati kid
Whoah, the Cincinnati kid
Whoah, the Cincinnati kid
I'm talking about the Cincinnati kid
Everybody knows the Cincinnati kid
Have you heard about the, the Cincinnati kid
Here we go again
He's back in town again

One more time
Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again, I will
One more time
I've been there before
But I'll try it again
Any fool, any fool knows
That there's no, no way to win
Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time
I've been there before
But I'll try it again
Any fool, any fool knows
That there's no, no way to win
Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time
I'll take her back again
One more time.
Come, they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
Our newborn King to see, pa rum pum pum pum

Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
Little Baby, pa rum pum pum pum

So to honor Him, pa rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for Him, pa rum pum pum pum

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door

Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
That's meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you
And so all else above
I'm dreaming of the man I love
The midnight hour has found me lonely
So unhappy as I can be
You left me, yes you left me without a love
Gave you my lovin, everything I owned
That's why it's so shockin' to find you've gone
It's getting me, it's hard to be, without a love
Haven't had no lovin' now since you know when
The way it's got me baby, you know, it's a sin
I haven't got no money and I've lost my friend
All because I fell for you
I don't know why I have to worry
When you left me in a hurry
You've gone and I'm alone without a love
Please believe me, you know I care
I'd follow you most anywhere
But now you've gone and I'm alone, without a love
The naughty lady of Shady Lane 
Has hit the town like a bomb 
The back-fence gossip ain't been this good 
Since Mabel ran off with Tom 
Our town was peaceful and quiet 
Before she came on the scene 
The lady has started a riot 
Disturbin' the suburban routine 
[Chorus:] 
 The naughty lady of Shady Lane has the town in a whirl 
 The naughty lady of Shady Lane 
 Me-oh, my-oh, what a girl 
 You should see how she carries on 
 With her admirers galore 
 She must be givin' them quite a thrill 
 The way they flock to her door 
 She throws those come-hither glances 
 At every Tom, Dick, and Joe 
 When offered some liquid refreshment 
 The lady never never says "no" 
[Chorus:] 
 The things they're trying to pin on her 
 Won't hold much water, for sure 
 Beneath the powder and fancy lace 
 There beats a heart sweet and pure 
 She just needs someone to change her 
 And she'll be nice as can be 
 If you're in the neighborhood, stranger 
 You're welcome to drop in and see 
 The naughty lady of Shady Lane 
 So delightful to hold 
 The naughty lady of Shady Lane 
 So delectable 
 Quite respectable 
 And she's only nine days old
Your the first and only one,
Whose ever had my heart,
Wrapped around your finger,
And every time I think of you,
I'm not surprised that the memories still linger
'Cause I still here the songs that we sing,
Each step I take down memory lane,
Just takes me further back in time,
Those memories are all I see,
Like photographs of you and me,
As I turn the pages of my mind,
The pages of my mind
Sometimes at lonely nights,
I close my eyes and feel you there beside me,
But deep inside my heart,
I know that I have only touched your memory
'Cause I still here the songs that we sing,
Each step I take down memory lane,
Just takes me further back in time,
Those memories are all I see,
Like photographs of you and me,
As I turn the pages of my mind,
The pages of my mind
'Cause I still here the songs that we sing,
Each step I take down memory lane,
Just takes me further back in time,
Those memories are all I see,
Like photographs of you and me,
As I turn the pages of my mind,
The pages of my mind
Your the first and only one,
Whose ever had me wrapped around your finger

You know I just don't understand it
I can't seem to get a nickle or a dime for a cup of coffee
I need a hamburg- in fact a hot dog wouldn't be too bad
I would just be grateful if I could get my hands on most anything
Bet it ain't raining back home,
Bet you sister's still on the phone,
Bet momma's in the kitchen cooking fried chicken,
Wishing that I hadn't done wrong. 
Momma, don't you worry about it none though,
Everything's gonna be alright, momma,
They're teaching us a lot of new things in here, momma,
Things like there ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
And you don't go writing hot checks down in Mississippi,
And there ain't no good chain gang. 
Papa's reading yesterday's mail,
Wishing that the hay was all bailed,
I bet he's wishing he could go fishing,
And here I am a'lazing in jail.
Well, papa, don't you worry about it none,
Now, everything's gonna be alright, papa,
They're teaching us a lesson today, 
We're learning pretty well too,
We've already learned a whole lot of stuff already,
Things like there ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
And you don't go writing hot checks down in Mississippi,
And there ain't no good chain gang. There ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,

And you don't go writing hot checks down in Mississippi,
And there ain't no good chain gang.
For there's a change in the weather, there's a change in the sea,
So from now on there'll be a change in me.
My walk will be different, my talk and my name,
Nothing about me is going to be the same.
I'm going to change my way of living if that ain't enough,
Then I'll change the way I strut my stuff
Cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray.
There'll be some changes made today, there'll be some changes made.
For there's a change in the fashions, ask the feminine folks,
Even Jack Benny has been changing jokes,
I must make some changes from old to the new,
I must do things just the same as others do.
I'm going to change my long tall Mama for a little short fat,
Going to change the number where I live at.
I must have some loving or I'll fade away.
There'll be some changes made today, there'll be some changes made
There are many many crazy things
That will keep me loving you
And with your permission
May I list a few
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No they can't take that away from me
We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No they can't take that away from me
Well-a, oh yeah
Well-a, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Do you know that this little girl of mine
I want you people to know
This little girl of mine
I take her everywhere I go

One day I looked at my suit
My suit was new
I looked at my shoes
and they were too

And that's why I, I, I, I
Oh, I love that little girl of mine
Oh, do you know that this little girl of mine
Makes me happy when I'm sad

This little girl of mine
Loves me, even when I'm bad
She knows how to love me right down to her teeth
If she does any wrong, you know she keeps it from me

And that's why I, I, I, I
Oh, I love that little girl of mine

Do you know that this little girl of mine
Called me last night about eight
This little girl of mine
Told me that we had a date

She said that she'd meet me at a quarter to nine
Believe it or not, but she was right on time
And that's why I, I, I, I
Oh, I love that little girl of mine

Do you know that this little girl of mine
Knows how to dress so neat
This little girl of mine
Stops the traffic on the street

When the fellas start whistling, well I don't mind
I can't blame them, 'cause she is fine
And that's why I, I, I, I
Oh, I love that little girl of mine

And that's why I, I, I, I
Oh, I love that little girl of mine
Look down on me if you want to, oh baby
You can count me out, don't count along
I've lost my taste for love before
It goes away, but it don't stay gone
I feel it in my bones, my bones
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again
Well, I cried till I'm all out of tear drops
And I hurt till I'm all out of pain
Then I wait for the first love that comes down the track
Like a hobo waiting for a train
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again
You may wonder just what keeps me going
It's the true love that waits down the line
I know that heartbreak is one more behind me
And true love is getting closer all the time
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
Little girls and little boys
Dream of worlds full of toys
This time of year
When Christmas is near
Evergreens are snowy white
Sleigh bells ring through the night
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
And somewhere near a steeple
People kneel and pray
And a choir sings
Carols of a Christmas Day
Mmm, can you hear me?
Santa Claus is on his way
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
Till the end of time 'long as stars are in the blue
'Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing, I'll go on loving you
Till the end of time 'long as roses bloom in May
My love for you will go deeper with every passing day
Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappear
I'll be there for you to care for you through laughter and through tears
So take my hand in sweet surrender, and tenderly say that I'm
The one you'll love and live for, till the end of time

So if you can't change, go on, let me be
Well, I'm sick of your lies
(Sick of your lies)
Tired of my tears
(Tired of my tears)
Girl, if you want me
Better tell it like it is
Oh when a boy meets a girl he likes
He starts to dream
Before he know it, he's caught buyin' his scheme
Now, I used to believe every word you say
But realize now that was yesterday

To all the girls I've loved before,
who traveled in and out my door
I'm glad they came along,
I dedicate this song
to all the girls I've loved before
To all the girls I once caressed,
and may I say, I've held the best,
for helping me to grow, I owe a lot, I know, 
to all the girls I've loved before
The winds of change are always blowing
and ev'ry time I tried to stay
The winds of change continued blowing,
and they just carried me a way
 
To all the girls who shared my life,
who now are someone else's wife;
I'm glad they came along,
I dedicate this song
to all the girls I've loved before.
To all the girls who cared for me,
who filled my nights with ecstacy;
they live within my heart;
I'll always be a part of all the girls I've loved before
the winds of change are always blowing
and ev'ry time I tried to stay
The winds of change continued blowing,
and they just carried me way
 
To all the girls we've loved before,
who traveled in and out our door;
we're glad they came along
we dedicate this song
Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again
Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong
The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again
And nothing else matters
We're together again
I've often been told that time bring 'bout a change
I've often been told that time bring 'bout a change
Yes, I've had two years of torture and my heart still feel the same
I had a real fine woman, fine as she could be
Let me tell ya, I had a real, real fine woman, fine as she could be
But the syndicators, back-biters stole that little girl away from me
Two years of being without her, seven hundred and thirty days
And I still remember her little brown body and the sweet love, baby way
Two years of torture and I'm still in misery
Oh, but I'm doomed as a lover unless she come back to me
Unchain my heart, baby let me be
Unchain my heart 'cause you don't care about me
You've got me so like a pillow case
But you let my love go away so
Unchain my heart oh! Please me set me free

Unchain my heart, baby let me go
Unchain my heart, 'cause you don't love me no more
Ev'ry time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home so
Unchain my heart oh! Please me set me free

I'm under you spell like a man in a trance
But I know darn well that I can't stand a chance

So unchain my heart let me go away
Unchain my heart, you worry me night and day
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart oh! Please me set me free
First you say you do
And then you don't
And then you say you will
And then you won't
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do? 
Now you want to play
And then it's no
And when you say you'll stay
That's when you go
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do? 
I've been sitting on a fence
And it doesn't make much sense
'Cause you keep me in suspense
And you know it
Then you promise to return
When you don't
I really burn
Well, I guess I'll never learn
And I show it
If you've got a heart
And if you're kind
Then don't keep us apart
Make up your mind
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
Understanding is the best thing in the world,
Between a boy and a girl
Boy and girl and even a woman or a man,
It's always better when you really understand
You know understanding is a mighty powerful thing,
that's why it makes me so sad
When I see my friends wandering around through the world,
Never knowing the meaning of the word
Understanding, so in the next few minutes, I'm gonna
Try to explain just exactly what it means
Now wait a minute, listen, for instance, you take me
And my old lady, we gotta good thing goin'
Because I know If I don't work and pay the rent and the
Bills and buy her fine pretty clothes to wear well,
There are fifteen other guys just waitin' round the
Corner, and I don't care how much that woman loves me,
She's gonna go out and find herself one of them who
Will and that's why I believe that
Understanding is the best thing in the world,
Between a boy and a girl
Boy and girl and even a woman or a man,
It's always better when you really understand
Now listen I don't want you to think that this is a
One sided affair, no no
Because my old lady also understands that a man must
Have respect
What I mean is, if she must play around don't let me
Catch her, because what I don't see can't hurt me, you
Understand? but on the other hand, If I should ever
Catch her I'm not gonna talk about-a
And call her a bunch of bad names like you all might
No no 
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go down-town to the
Hardware store and buy myself a double blade axe,
Come back, square off, and believe her soul's gonna
Belong to the good lord
Because her head's gonna belong to me, and I
Guarantee she'll know what I mean when I'll say
Understanding is the best thing in the world,
Between a boy and a girl
Boy and girl and even a woman or a man,
It's always better when you really understand
Well, I swear I didn't see you with your wife's best girlfriend
Drinkin' beer and a-dancin' to that western swing
And I didn't see you kiss her and leave that barroom with her

George, I know I didn't hear you tell that blonde that you weren't married (no, uh-uh)

No, I don't but you know if I had seen you I certainly would've paid ya
But I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
We've got to stick together to keep our stories straight
Don't forget I was down in Atlanta and don't you forget I was working late
But you know it's always good to see you, George, it's good to see you too
But I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do

The wheel of fortune,
Goes spinnin' around.
Will the arrow point my way.
Will this be my day. 
Oh, wheel of fortune,
Please don't pass me by,
Let me know the magic of,
A kiss and a sigh. 
While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning,
I'll not dream of winning fortune or fame.
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning,
I'll be yearning, yearning for love's precious flame. 
Oh, wheel of fortune,
I'm hopin', somehow,
If you ever smile on me,
Please let it be now. 
While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning,
I'll not dream of winning fortune or even fame.
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning,
I'll be yearning, yearning for love's precious flame. 
Oh, wheel of fortune,
I'm hopin', somehow,
If you ever smile on me,
Please let it be now.
If you were mine,
I could be a ruler of kings
And if you were mine,
I could do such wonderful things,
I'd say to a star, "stop where you are,
Light up my lover's way."
And every star above you would obey
And if you were mine
I would live for your love alone
To kneel at your shrine
I would give up all that I own
Yes, even my heart, even my life
I'd trade it all for you
And think I was lucky, too
If you were mine.
What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air
When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone
What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone
Oh, when the saints, go marching in,

Oh Lord I want to be in that ever lovin' number
When the saints go marching in.
Oh, when the saints, go marching in,
Yes when the saints go marching in.
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in. 
Oh yes, I had a dear old mother,
And if you should see her before I do,
Won't you tell her that you saw me coming,
I was struttin' straight on through
Oh, when the saints, go marching in,
Yes when the saints go marching in.
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.

Sleigh bells ring, are you list'nin'?
In the lane, snow is glist'nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
In a meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?", we'll say, "no, man
But you can do the job when you're in town"
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose get a little chillin'?
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way, walkin' in a winter wonderland
In a meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?", we'll say, "no, man

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Oh, walk on, mm-hmm
Let's frolic and play the Eskimo way, walkin' in a winter wonderland
Come on, walk it, hmm, get on
All night long
One night, I could not sleep
For ringing in my ear
A melody began to sing
Oh, at first
The words I could not make out clear
The smog fields lifted away
And this is what I heard them say
It said without love
(Without love)
There's nothing you can do
Yes, it did
It said without love
(Without love)
You're not even you
All night long
He spoke to me
The words of wisdom rang
Beneath his sweet, soft melody
It said, don't you know
(Don't you know)
That a rich man can be poor
If wealth is all he has, hey
Without love
(Without love)
There's nothing you can do
(Do, do, do, do, do)
Don't you know
Without love
You're not even you
(Without love)
Can't you hear me talking to you
(Can't you hear us talking to you)
Without love, oh
The sorrow's even new
Yes, it is
Without love

You're not even you
Sing it, sing it
One more time

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go, I don't know,
She wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.

Be real sweet to your sweetheart.
Never never make her cry.
'Cause you'll always miss the water when the well goes dry...

Make true love to your lover,
When the moon's high in the sky.
'Cause you'll always miss the water when the well goes dry...

It's tough to be alone and you're love is not there.
It's rough to need your (inaudible) lying in your solitaire...

So, be sweet to your sweetheart,
And she'll never say goodbye.
Then the water in your well will never never go dry...

(Piano Solo)...

Then the water in your well will never, never go dry...

You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me (no you don't know me)

No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
Longs to hold you tight
Oh I am just a friend
That's all I've ever been
Cause you don't know me (no you don't know me)

I never knew the art of making love
No my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too (love me too)

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh you will never know
The one who loves you so
Well you don't know me

Stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem
Could there be eyes like yours? 
Could there be lips like yours?
Could there be smiles like yours
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, alone and apart
Out of a dream, safe into my heart

Your victim now
'Cause soon, his head
Like mine will bow

He'll give his heart
But all in vain
And some day say
You win again

You have no heart
You have no shame
You take true love
And give the blame

I'll guess that I
Should not complain
I love you still
Well, you win again

When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
What do you think you'll do then
I bet they shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
I know you told me
Such a long time ago
That you didn't want me
You didn't love me no more

I want to know
Oh, what makes me be
Do you believe me child, a fool for you?
Oh-oh, no, I'm a fool for you

I know you told me
You didn't want me 'round
Yeah, and I know
You got a man way 'cross town

So I know it's something
Oh, what makes me be?
Do you believe me child, I'm a fool for you?
Oh-oh, I'm a fool for you

Did ya ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day
Reach over and feel the pillow
Where your baby used to lay?
Then you put on your crying
Like you never cried before
Oh lord
Yeah, you even cry so loud
You give the blues to your neighbour next door
Ever since you were five years old, baby
I been a fool for you, little girl
Way down in my soul
I'm a little fool for ya

So I know it's something
Oh, oh, Lord, I'm a fool for you
A sentimental blues
Will worry you
And make you do
Things that you
Wouldn't do
Only when you
Hear these blues
A sentimental blues
Will wet your eye
You wonder why
You heave a sigh
You start to cry
Each time that you
Hear these blues
Sigh, sigh, sigh
And drool
Cry, cry, cry
You fool
Yes, I know that it's cool
A sentimental blues
Deep down inside
Will make you hide
Your foolish pride
A sentimental blues
Will make you lose
Your mind
Sigh, sigh, sigh
And drool
Cry, cry, cry
You fool
Yes, I know that it's cool
A sentimental blues
Deep down inside
Will make you hide
Your foolish pride
A sentimental blues
Will make you lose
Your mind
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you, yes
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you, baby
We were alone and I was singin' my song,
Singin' my song, singin' my song, singin' my song
Singin' my song
A fool am I, a fool am I, in love 
A tear fell when I saw you
In the arms of someone new
A tear fell when you left me
All alone and feeling blue
A tear fell when you told me
That your love was not for me
I didn't miss the teardrops,
But I missed you constantly
A fool am I, a fool am I, in love
The teardrops that you stepped on
As you danced across the floor.
Were crushed like my poor heart was
When you walked out of my door.
That the flame in your heart died.
Darlin', have I lost you
Like these teardrops from my eyes
A fool am I, a fool am I, in love
Listen to yo' daddy warn you
'Fore you start a-traveling
Woman may born you, love you and mourn you
But a woman is a sometime thing
Yes a woman is a sometime thing
Yo' mammy is the first to name you
Then she'll tie you to her apron string
Then she'll shame you and she'll blame you
Till yo' woman comes to claim you
'Cause a woman is a sometime thing
Yes a woman is a sometime thing
Don't you never let a woman grieve you
Jus' 'cause she got yo' weddin' ring
She'll love you and deceive you
Then she'll take yo' clothes and leave you
'cause a woman is a sometime thing
Yes a woman is a sometime thing
Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people, but it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone
Has anybody here seen my old friend John?

He freed a lot of people, but the good they die young
I just looked around and he was gone
Yeah
Oh I just looked around they were gone
Oh yeah
I laughed the day I saw you leave
I laughed and said, ?I'd never grieve?

But now after my laughter came tears
(After my laughter came tears )

I told my friends, I didn't care
I laughed about a whole affair

But say now
After my laughter came tears

My cryin' helped me from showin' them
That I was blue
(Listen )

By myself you
L never know what I've been through
(Just what I'm goin' through )

My lips conceal a hurtin' pain
I make believe but all in vain

I said now after
My cryin' helped me from showin' them
That I was blue

My cryin' helped me from showin' them
That I was blue

My lips conceal a hurtin' pain
I make believe but all in vain
No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you
I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you
Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me
I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you
Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I'm Alabamy bound

Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth
All I'm worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth
Just hear the choo-choo sound
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground
And then I'll holler so the world will know
Here I go, I'm Alabamy bound
I'm Alabamy bound
They'll be no heebie-jeebies hanging 'round
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth
All I'm worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth

Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Oh honey,  all I ever need is you
You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you
Never knew the softness of his tender kiss
Don't know if he's weak or strong
All I know is he's every dream I dream
All night long
Never heard him say a single word of love
Don't know his fate or his soul
'Cause he only speaks to me in dreams I've dreamed
All night long
When I sleep he tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best my dream is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand he'll disappear, no no no
I don't wanna love that's just a memory
Fate, how could you be so warm?
Now, I've got to find the man who's haunting me
All night long
When I sleep he tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best my dream is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand he'll disappear, no no no
I don't wanna love that's just a memory
Fate, how could you be so warm?
Now, I've got to find the man who's haunting me
All night long
Now, I've got to find the man who's haunting me
All night long
All night long
All night long
Alone together, beyond the crowd, 
Above the world, we're not too proud 
To cling together, we're strong 
As long as we're together. 
Alone together, the blinding rain 
The starless night, were not in vain; 
For we're together, and what is there 
To fear together. 
Our love is as deep as the sea, 
Our love is as great as a love can be, 
And we can weather the great unknown, 
If we're alone together.
Am I blue? Am I blue?
Ain't these tears
In my eyes tellin'g you?
Am I blue? You'll be too,
If each plan with you man
Done fell through.
Was a time I was his only one,
But now I'm the sad
And lonely one,
"Lawdy," Was I gay? 'til today,
Now he's gone and we're through,
Am I blue?
Oh beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self, our country loved
And mercy more than life
America, America may God thy gold refine
Til all success be nobleness
And every gain divined
And you know when I was in school
We used to sing it something like this, listen here
Oh beautiful, for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain
But now wait a minute, I'm talking about
America, sweet America
You know, God done shed his grace on thee
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this
(America, America, God shed his grace on thee)
America, I love you America, you see
My God he done shed his grace on thee
And you oughta love him for it
Cause he, he, he ,he crowned thy good
He told me he would, with brotherhood
(From sea to shining Sea)
Oh lord, oh lord, I thank you Lord
(Shining sea)
Angel eyes angel eyes
The ways of the world are feeble
Don't give up on simple people
Angle eyes stun those nights
The blues you can live without
It's not what you song's about
Angel eyes angel eyes
Tell me what would we're doin'
Without the light from angel eyes
You can move the hearts of men
Just with a phrase you're turning
Since hearts ever have been yearning
Bear with us bear so alone
Thin lines you've been living on
Are so close to the danger zone
Angel eyes angel eyes
Tell me what would we're doin'
Without the light from angel eyes
Angelina, why did you have to go
It's hard enough alone, well you should know
The scars you never showed me
Your eyes that turned away
Angelina, to God for you I prayed
Angelina, I often heard you weep
At times I'd stay awake and watch you sleep
Your innocence would move me
At times you've made me scared
Angelina, my love for you I cared
Angelina, in silence you would speak
A simple touch of you and I grew weak
You finally let me hold you
The day before you died
Angelina, my angel in the sky
You finally let me hold you
The day before you died
Angelina, my angel in the sky
Well, I just stopped in this evening
To get myself a little taste
The music is nice and swinging
And of course, I really dig the place

Course, I haven't
Had much sleep lately
I feel sorta down and out

Yeah, but look over there
In the corner, man
Oh, yeah, there's something
To shout about

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
Cause as soon as I pay the bartender
Girl, I'll be right there

She looked up and blushed and smiled
And my heart skipped a beat
Mmm, she's stacked from
Her head down to her feet

Hey, barkeep
You better come here and get your bread
This little girl's getting ready to split
And I'm about to go out of my head

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
I'm afraid if I lose sight of you
I just might not see you no more

She slowed up just a little bit
And turned her head and smiled
She was 34-24-38
And dressed in the latest style

I finally caught up
With the pretty little thing
Before she got out on the street

And she told she was
Waiting on her old man
Who was a policeman on the beat

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
If you're a policeman's woman
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.
Just talking to you is a crime

(That's right, bud, let's go)
Oh, no
I say, baby, don't you cry
You know I'll soon discover
One day by and by
That you loved another
No matter what you say
I'm gonna leave you right away
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mmm, you know you can't deny
I did my best to please you
But you were so unkind
But still I try to need you
True love that was sincere
You didn't really care
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry
And I remember, sweetheart
That it was you and I
Who said that we must part, uh huh
And the time has
Come to say goodbye
So why do you cry, sweetheart
Hey, hey, baby, don't you cry
Because I'm interfering
You ought to be satisfied
You know I'm gonna keep on caring
Why should you feel blue
I'll tell you, I'm gonna
Be the one to lose
Baby, baby, don't you cry
Whoa, baby, don't you cry
Because of any hearing
You ought to be satisfied because
I'm gonna keep on caring
Why should you feel blue
You know I'll be the one to lose
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Late at night
When it's dark and cold
I reach out
For someone to hold
When I'm blue
When I'm lonely
She comes through
She's the only one who can
My baby grand
Is all I need

In my time
I've wandered everywhere
Around this world
She would always be there
Any day
Any hour
All it takes
Is the power in my hands
This baby grand's
Been good to me

I've had friends
But they have slipped away
I've had fame
But it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes
Spent them fast enough
As for woman
They don't last with just one man
But baby grand
Will stand by me

They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these
Played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far
From the life I've strayed in
I've got scars
From those dives I've played in
Now I'm home
And I'm weary
In my bones
Every dreary one night stand
But baby grand
Came home with me

Ever since this gig began
My baby grand's
Been good to me
(I really can't stay)
Betty, it's cold outside
(I've got to go away)
Betty, it's cold out there
(This evening has been)
Been hoping that you'd drop in
(So very nice)
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
(My mother will start to worry)
Beautiful, what's you're hurry
(And father will be pacing the floor)
Listen to that fireplace roar
(So really I'd better scurry)
Beautiful, please don't hurry
(Well, maybe just a half a drink more)
Why don't you put some records on while I pour
(And the neighbors might think)
Betty it's bad out there
(Say, what's in this drink?)
No cab's to be had out there
(I wish I knew how)
Your eyes are like starlight now
(To break the spell)
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
(I ought to say no, no, no, sir)
Mind if I move in closer?
(At least I'm gonna say that I tried)
What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?
(I really can't stay)
Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
(I simply must go)
Betty, it's cold outside
(The answer is no)
I say, it's cold out there
(The welcome has been)
How lucky that you dropped in
(So nice and warm)
Look out that window, man that's hard
(My sister will be suspicious )
Gosh, your lips look delicious
(My brother will be there at the door)
Waves upon a tropical shore
(My maiden aunt's mind is vicious)
Gosh, your lips are delicious
(Well maybe just a cigarette more)
Oh, never such a blizzard before
(I've got to go home)
Betty, you'll freeze out there
(Say, lend me your coat)
It's up to your knees out there
(You've really been grand)
I thrill when you touch my hand
(But don't you see)
How can you do this thing to me
(There's bound to be talk tomorrow)
Think of my lifelong sorrow
(At least there will be plenty implied)
If you caught pneumonia and died
(I really can't stay)
Get over that old lie
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby let me hold your hand
Until I make you understand
Ohh, baby, baby let me hold your hand
I really believe, everything will sure be grand
Baby I want you by my side
Our love we could never hide
Ohh, baby, baby I want you by my side
Well you know pretty baby, our love we would never hide
Baby I'll buy you a diamond ring
Cadillac and everything
Then baby, I'm gonna buy you a house in style
Then I'll live there forever, yes lord with my little wife and child
I got the blues
I feel so lonely
I'd give the world if I could only make you understand
Yes, it surely would be grand
I'm simply wild about my baby
Ask her won't she please come home
Since she's gone I stay worried all the time
So, baby, won't you please come home?
You know your daddy's all alone
I have tried but all in vain
Never no more to call your name
Since you left, you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you please come home to your daddy?
Baby, won't you please come home?
Since you left you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you please come home to your daddy?
Baby, won't you please come home?
Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans
The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street
Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means
Glad to be, oh yes-sirree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues
Basin Street, oh Basin Street
Is the street, mama 
New Orleans, land of dreams
Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally
If you will be my love
 
Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally
After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake
Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms
Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best
Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank god, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there
Romance, finis. your chance, finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can
They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues
And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!
Ah, let me tell you people
About this blackjack game
It's caused me nothing but trouble
And I've only myself to blame

Hey-hey, hey, yeah
How unlucky can one man be?
Well, every quarter I get, now
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me

My friends don't come around me
Because I've been so blind
I can't even borrow a nickel
Now I've almost lost my mind

Hey-hey hey, yeah
How unlucky can one man be?
Well, every quarter I get
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me

I sat there with two tens
I thought I'd have some fun
The dealer hit sixteen with a five
Just enough to make twenty-one

Hey-hey hey, yeah, yeah
How unlucky can one man be?

We had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
Meeting all the groovy people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealis
We're space truckin' round the the stars
Come on let's go space truckin'
Remember when we did the moonshot
And pony trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moon stop
And every naut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' round the stars
Come on let's go space truckin'
The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah the freaks said
Man those cats can really swing
They got music in their solar system
They've rocked around the Milky Way
They dance around the Borealis
They're space truckin' everyday

I was born in a trunk
Mother died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
Grew up in a dusty shack
And all I had was a'hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road
I'm gonna leave and get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road
Bring Dynamite and a crane
Blow you up, start all over again
Build a town be proud to show
Give the name Tobacco Road
Cause it's home
The only life I've ever known
Oh I despise and disapprove you
But I love ya, 'cause it's home
Woke up this morning, I couldn't hardly keep from cryin'

About an old friend of mine 
Ah now ya used to be so beautiful, but I don't believe you gonna last 
Used to be beautiful, well I don't see how you gonna last 
Babe if you don't stop the way ya doin',

I tore all the good looking women somewhere
Sure enough baby that's me, 'cause it's gonna happen

About three months long before I was born

Then I go home with you

We're gonna watch them run at midnight
But the one that's running just gonna lie dead

12:00 o' clock at night--you walk out the door.
You told me baby--you were going to the drug-store.
Well, in my mind, I knew you were lying
The drug-store closed at a quarter to nine.
I say I saw you kissing Jimmy across the fence,
I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense.
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You done put me in a trick-bag.
When I come home, start an argument,
Just to keep you from asking where my voodoo went.
Peep out the front door--I hear the back door slam.
I peek out of my window--somebody's taking it on the lam.
I say I saw you kissing Jimmy across the fence,
I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense.
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You done put me in a trick-bag.
We had a fight, then you got mad;
Got on the telephone--called your mom and dad.
Dad said, "She's my daughter and I'm her pa,
And you ain't nothing but a son-in-law."
I say I saw you kissing Jimmy across the fence,
I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense.
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You done put me in a trick-bag.
Don't care how long you gone
I don't care how long you staying
But, good kind treatment
Gonna bring you home someday

It had rained for 3 days straight
But the sun was beginning to shine
Two riders were approachin?
But they were no friends of mine.

Called out for Hanna
And I kept here close to my side
Whistled for old Thunder
And my horse he was ready to ride

CHORUS:
I give you everything I had babe
Ain?t that kindness
I give you the good with the bad babe
Ain?t that kindness
Don?t cha know I give you my love when say babe
Ain?t that kindness
Hmmm ya know a man ain?t nothing without his gun
Ya know a man ain?t nothing without his gun

2nd Verse:
Took to the road 6 night and days
Only then did we think it was safe
Heard the sound of 2 men approachin?
But they did not hesitate 

Hanna she was cryin?
But she wouldn?t let go of my leg
Thunder he was tired
Been a thinkin? of a better day

Repeat Chorus:

3rd Verse:
Two shots fired and two figures fell
There was blood flowin? over the ground
Two men dead in the noon day sun
And they never ever made a sound

Hanna she never forgave me
And I think I know the reason why
When I called out for Thunder
The horse he up and died.

Repeat Chorus:
God's got a plan
He's makin' it clear
Sweet little love song
In your ear
Like hearts made of diamond
Love will prevail
Put a little wind in your sail
I'd do anything, anything
You could dream of
I'd do anything, anything
For your love

Every married woman, I believe

Ain't no married woman that's gonna
Treat nobody right,
Ain't no married woman that's gonna
Treat nobody right
She lay around with a cute man all day
And's pretty sick of her husband at night

Knock on your front door
Run around the back, I'll believe
You'll catch him there
Just before he goes 'round the corner
Every married woman, you know,
Has some backdoor friend
You know when you walk out

I asked her for a little thrill
She said I'm so sorry daddy,
But I'm puttin' out the same thing you is
I took the woman out ridin',
Bought her all kinds of whiskey and wine
I guess I was too drunk to realize,
She say I'll see you some other time
The woman gets all dressed up to boogie,
Goes out smelling sweet like a rose
Comes home 5 o'clock in the mornin',
With that fish scent on her clothes
Yeah, woo

Looking for my woman but she ain't nowhere around
Woo ho

Ought to see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on.

We're all happy now as we can be.
Making love underneath the apple tree.

I want to get married on a night in June,
And rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon.
Cause I love her and she loves me,
We're all happy now as we can be.
Making love underneath the apple tree.
She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire.

Making love underneath the apple tree.

Cheap perfume, sweet perfume
Lonely smell that fills the room
Roses in your low-rent tomb
A picture made of cheap perfume
Sad old rag, sad young hag
Clothes that hide the early sag
Sequins on a lame bag
The sparkles of a sad old rag.
[Chorus:]
Drink up and be happy
Live just for today
Drown in cheap tequila
And flush yourself away.
Worn out dream, washed up scheme
Blueprint for a death machine
Scarred wrists on a movie queen
A picture of a worn out dream.
[Chorus: x2]
Well, listen now boys...to what I say, 
This ol' game of love is easy to play,
There's only one way to see...what the 
Future will hold,
You better - check out her mama before
You get bold

Refrain:
Check out her mama, before you say I do;
Check out her mama 'cause' jus' between me
And you;
Unless her mama is fine, you better take
Your time; 
She's gonna look jus' like her mama on 
Down the line.

Now, you think you've found the girl of
Your dreams,
Well, pretty things aren't just what they
Seem.
'f you wanna see - what the future will
Hold,
You better - check out her mama before 
You get bold.

Refrain

[solo guitar for 2 choruses (chorii?)]

Now, don't get in a hurry 'cause this ain't
No race.
And don't get taken in by a pretty face.
You know that beauty is only skin deep,
So play your cards right or a sweeter (?)
Man be.

Refrain [except with ... if her mama
Ain't fine you better take your time...]

[Take it out with soloing]
Goin' back to Dallas, take my razor and my gun
Goin' back to Dallas, man, take my razor and my gun, oh yeah
Lots of people lookin' for trouble, man, sure gonna give 'em in some
I believe old Dallas, man, is the meanest town I know
I believe that Dallas, man, is the meanest town I know
Because you're not safe in Dallas, I don't care where you go
You know that I'm evil, just want to have some fun
There's so much shit in Texas, I'm bound to step in some
Goin' back to Dallas, take my razor and my gun
If there are people lookin' for trouble, sure gonna give 'em some

Down to Dallas, take my razor and my gun
Man, people there lookin' for trouble, sure gonna give 'em some
I used to live with the whiskey
And the good time and the ladies of the night
Then the whiskey took control
Left me waltzing with the witches in my mind

But imaginary bottles won't be everywhere
To haunt me like before
'Cos I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

So, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

It don't matter where you came from
All I know is that you gave me back my pride
You reached out your hand and saved a man
Who strayed about as far as he could slide

And you probably came from heaven
Who else could've sent you but the Lord
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

So, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

Yeah, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore, yeah

Yeah, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
And I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

Ooh, you're the kind of girl who could change my world
If you just take hold of my hand now
Make the mountains scream, drive my brain machine
But you don't seem to understand now

Turn me inside out and upside down
Take me down low
But you keep it hidden deep inside
So it's got nowhere to go

Don't hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't hide the love that you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

You got miles and miles of deep-sea smiles
But I never seen them surface
You got this and that and the other thing
But you don't realize their purpose

How can you be so damn naive?
You cause me some frustration
You keep it under lock and key
Why don't you try my combination?

Don't you hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't you hide your love that you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

Such a dirty deal

Don't hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't hide your love 'cause you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

Such a dirty deal
Such a dirty deal
Don't hide your love
Oh girl
When I think about my baby, I got evil on my mind
When I think about that woman, I got evil on my mind
It brings teardrops to my eyes and sends chills out down my spine
It sends chills out down my spine, when I watch this woman walk
Sends chills out down my spine, when I watch that woman walk
And she smiles right in your face and lies ev'ry times she talks
Look out!
They say your enemies can't hurt you, if you keep track on your friends
They say your enemies can't hurt you, if you keep track on your friend
I say you know what your woman, that's the one who threw you in

It's your mistake I'm thinking of
I wonder if I'm still in love

I wonder if I care as much
As I did before
It brings a tear into my eyes
When I begin to realize
I cried so hard, Lord, since you've been gone
Look like, boy I'm gonna drown, Lord, in my own tears now

But I know only to cry just like a child

Way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Johnny B. Goode
He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
Oh, sit beneath the trees, linger in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
"Oh my, but that country boy can play!"
Go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go!
Now, Johnny B. Goode
Oh, come on Johnny, do it!
Oh, look out!
His mother told him someday he would be a man
And he would be the leader of a rock'n'roll band
Oh, many people coming from miles around
Hear him play his guitar when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name would be in lights
Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight!"
Go, go!
Go Johnny go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go, go, Johnny B. Goode!

I've got the key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
Gonna leave here runnin'
Walking is most too slow

I'm going back, back to the border
Where I'm better known
I'm going back to the border, baby
And all you can do is mourn

When the moon peeps over the mountain
Yes baby, I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roll this highway until the break of day

When I was so long, so long, baby
Yes baby, I must say goodbye
I'm gonna roam this highway until the day I die

Give me one more kiss, baby
Yes, before I go long
When I leave this time
I ain't comin' back no more
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
Say, you better leave my woman alone
Well, I know you are a playboy
And you've got women all over town
But listen, buddy, if you ever sweet-talk my little girl
I'm gonna lay your body down
[Chorus]
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
You know you don't want, oh yeah (get in trouble)
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)

Well, I know you got your money
And you've got a new fifty-six too
But if I ever see my little girl in your new car
I'm gonna do some work on you
[Chorus]
Well, I don't believe in trouble
So I don't want to start a fight
So if you'll take heed and stay away from my little girl
Then everything will be alright

Living on the Highway            L Russell/D Nix
It was twenty years ago, I was about fourteen years old,
When I first heard that Wolfman's howl.
He sneaked me through the door, there was whisky on the floor, 
And the fuzz they were on the prowl
 It seems so long ago,
I'm living on the Highway now
He's a giant of a man, He always understands 
The very best notes to use
His hand make two of mine, his heart beat right on time
He taught me how to sing the blues
He's the reason why I choose to live on the highway now
I played the blues with Walter, and Muddy pulled me through
I know a Jimmy Rogers song or two
But there's one thing I know, no matter where I go
I can do a little howling too
That's why I sing these blues, I'm living on the highway now
The years have come and gone but the blues still go on
I only sing my songs for fun
If you ask me to, I'll do a song for you,
'Cause the women like to see me come
Me and my guitar,  my band, we're living on the highway now
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
I got me another woman, baby, yon' come your man 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
I got me another woman and, uhh, baby, yon' come your man 
You hurried up and went to the wall, 
And you know it was tough, uhh 
I don't know how many men you's killed, 
But, I know you done killed enough for two 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
I got me another woman, now baby, yon' come your man 
Oh yeah 
I love you baby, but you just can't treat me right, 
Spend all my money and walk the streets all night 
But, look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
I got me another woman, and baby, yon' come your man
Now if you wanna love that woman
You love her with a thrill
'Cause a if you don't, a some other man will
You've got to love her with a feeling
You've got to love her with a feeling
Love her with a feeling, man
Or don't you love at all
She shakes all over a when she walks
She made a blind man see
She made a dumb man talk
You know she love me with a feeling
A love me with a feeling
Love me with a feeling baby
Or don't you love at all
The cops took her in
How that woman didn't need no bail
How she wiggled one time for the judge
And the judge put the, cops in jail
You know you love me with a feeling
A love me with a feeling
Love me with a feeling, baby
Or don't you love at all
Just about a year ago, I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune, lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you will
Know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Rode in on the Greyhound, I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through, must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my
Friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
The man from the magazine said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans
Fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar, for every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play while people sat there
Drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
Morning rain keeps on falling 
Like the tears that fall from my eyes 
As I sit in my room 
Staring out at the gloom 
That's the rain in the same old blues 
I can't help, I can't help but thinking
When the sun used to shine on my back door 
Now the sun is turned to rain 
All my laughter is turned to pain
Yes it's the same, the same old blues
 
Sunshine, sunshine is all you see now
But it all, it all looks like clouds by me
When I sit in my room 
Staring out at the gloom 
It's the rain, it's the same old blues 
Yeah, yes it's the rain, it's the same old blues
Yeah, yes it's the rain, it's the same old blues
I've got to ride that lonesome train
My heart is heavy with aches and pain
I said but someday, someday baby
After a while
You will be sorry
Every day, my clouds are gray
It takes you to roll all those clouds away
I said but someday, someday baby
After a while
You will be sorry
Trouble, trouble, trouble on my mind
Trouble, trouble, way down the line
I don't need, I don't need no sympathy
So babe, babe, don't you, don't you pity me
I may be blue, but I don't mind
Because I know way down the line
I said but someday, someday baby
After a while
You will be sorry
Something you got, baby
Makes me work all day
Something you got, baby
Makes me bring home my pay
Something you got, baby

You told me baby, once upon a time
You said if I would be yours, you would sure be mine
That's alright
I know you don't love me no more baby, but that's alright
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight
You told me baby, your love for me was strong

Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight
The sky is crying,

The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
You know the sky's been crying
Can see you see the tears roll down my door
The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything
The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow
The moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's the thought of you
The very thought of you, my dear
Walkin' by myself, I hope you'll understand
I just walk to be your lovin' man
I love you, yes, I love you with all my heart and soul
I wouldn't mistreat you for my weight in gold
You know I love you, you know it's true
Give you all my lovin', what more can I do

Gonna cast all my troubles
And cast 'em to the deep, blue sea
Well I'm drifting and drifting,

In this world to care for me.

I'm going down. My nose is in the sand
I'm going down, down, baby. My nose is in the sand
A cloud of dust just came over me 
and I think I'm drowning on dry land
You know, my father told me, son don't rush to be a man
You know, my father told me, son don't you rush to be a man
But I went ahead on, and now I think I'm drowning on dry land
You know my mother told me the story,
about that lil' dog that couldn't see too well
He was crossing a railroad track one day,
when the train cut off a part of his tail
He turned around but never looked up, just to peep over the rail
And she said he lost his whole head
trying to find a little piece of tail
That's why I'm going down, my nose is in the sand
A could of dust just came over me
And now I think I'm drowning on dry land
Everybody wants to laugh
Ah, but nobody wants to cry
I say everybody wants to laugh
But nobody wants to cry
Everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
Everybody want to hear the truth
But yet, everybody wants to tell a lie
I say everybody wants to hear the truth
But still they all want to tell a lie
Oh everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
Everybody want to know the reason
Without even askin' why
Oh, everybody want to know the reason
Oh, without even askin' why
You know everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
One, two, three, four!

But you did know you wanted to travel

Didn't have really many clothes
Didn't know nobody to call to sing for you
So you had to get out there in no time, you know
(so)
You don't make no tiffanies, you say

I cut your wood so easy for you, woman
You can't help but say 'Hot dog!'
Now this tune is all about a girl that's got a good man
But she gonna leave him, to another, for another slick talkin' dude
But I advised her not to burn down the bridge
She might want to come back
One, two, three, four!
Your mind's set on leavin'
To a house down a one way street
Say you're gonna lock up all the doors
And throw away the key
Oh, but don't burn down the bridge, darlin'
You just might want to come back
'Cause the grass ain't no greener
On the other side of the track
Oh, you counted me out, before I could get to bat
All the things are out-ta the Chevrolet
Tomorrow night be drivin' a Cadillac
But don't burn down the bridge, darlin'
You just might want to come back
'Cause the grass ain't no greener
On the other side of the track
Hey!
All your so called friends
Taught you how to cheat an' lie
Now it seem like you gonna jump
From the fryin' pan to the fire
Oh, but don't burn down your bridge, darlin'
You just might want to come back
'Cause the grass ain't no greener
On the other side of the track
Hey! Ha!
Thank you! Woo!
Thank you very much!

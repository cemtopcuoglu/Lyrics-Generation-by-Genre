I know this town like the back of my hand
Every back road, every turn road
Baby, where you wanna go?
Get you there with my eyes closed
Just pick the spot, say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight you're calling the shots
We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
Been waiting all day just to see what you got on
Is it your high heels, your blue jeans?
Maybe that red dress, or climing up in your bare feet
I'll put the pedal down, but baby, you got the keys
We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight

You're driving this thing tonight
Just pick the spot, say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight, you're calling the shots
Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drive
And a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
If you ain't a ten you're a nine point nine
Tippin' n' spillin' that home made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Thrown little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God all mighty
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
So let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be,
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
Yeah I'm a little drunk on you
It's like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
Right outta the blue
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down messing with my mood
I'd love to say I could hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
I wanna tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard 
Would love a good break
But they feel it too
Every time I see you
Why I gotta see you?
You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down messing with my mood
I'd love to say I could hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you
Every time I see you, yeah
Oh, you're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down messing with my mood
I'd love to say I could hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Oh, every time I see you (Every time I see you)
Oh yeah
Oh, I'm walkin' down the street
And you walk right up to me and I freeze
Every time I see you
I don't remember much about that time,
Just the smell of the air and your hand in mine
Riding the strip, sittin' on my lap
In the back of the truck with the only friends I had
It was spring break, we were out late,
And I though goodness for heavens sake
When I saw you
And then I kissed you
On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you, faded away
I still taste the shots on your lips that night,
And the smoke from the club still burns my eyes
Feel of your body takin' off your dress,
Waking up that morning in a tangled mess
So if I'da known, I'da held on
A little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose,
'Cause I still see you
On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you, faded away
On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
I watched you drive through the gate
Without saying the words I needed to say
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the tears on your face
And the sun going down that day
Girl you, faded away
You faded away
Ridin' down the road listenen' to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said "Baby this is it,
The one I wanted you to hear
Don't it sound just like us?"
Up 'til then, all I'd ever listened to 
Was a little sweet home, Tuesday's gone,
And workin' man blues
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you 
And everything you do
You're my one, my from now on
My first love song
Baby I'm not who I was
You gave me your love 
And it woke me up
Made me more aware 
Of somethin deep inside
Something that I have
A life I wanna share
And I'll remember this as long as I live
Every note, every word
Every single kiss
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you 
And everything you do
You're my one, my from now on
My first love song
Baby, this is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you 
And everything you do
You're my one, my from now on
My first love song
Yeah, baby, my first love song
You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar
and you act like you never saw me
When you're dancing with him
and you're looking at me
Or I'm holding her, and I'm hoping you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

This break-up, make-up,hot and cold thing got me dizzy
You don't want me til I got somebody with me
It's gonna kill me
Baby tell me, what am I supposed to do with you

And all of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games
All of these games
Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't know what you do
You don't know how bad you turn me on
You don't know what it does
You don't know how you don't do no wrong
You got me wrapped around your little finger
Oh, good lookin' girl
That little dimple when you smile
Might as well be a hook in my heart
It's so simple how I feel I gotta just be wherever you are
Every time I pick you up
It's like you start

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me
With those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a long night
I can't help but tell myself
Oh you boy you got it so damn good

Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't have to say a thing
Just sit there and let me sing to you
Let the sun lit down
And the moon come around and just move ya
And let me just get lost
In how good looking girl
You can be when you don't even mean to be
Because it's so natural
With your hair pulled up
And my hat girl you know I can't handle
Some things I just can't handle
'Cause you start

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me
With those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a long night
I can't help but tell myself,
Oh you boy you got it so good with this good looking girl

Good mornin', good looking girl
I ain't never felt nothin quite like

When you're rocking me, rocking me
Gotta roll with it
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
And I'mma gon' lose it
When you look at me, look at me
With those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a long night
I can't help but tell myself,
Oh you boy you got it so good with this good looking girl

You're my good looking girl
What's up girl
Yeah, I know that color on your lips too well
I saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again
When I say I love you, just just say "I know."
You put your arms around me, but it's all for show, and then
There you go
Wrecking my whole world, all fixed up
My goodbye girl
You scatter in the wind just like a dandelion
Reminding me again that you ain't ever mine for long
But I know it's gonna happen when the moon is right
You'll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song
And there you go
Wrecking my whole world, one more hello
One more goodbye, girl
It might seem crazy to keep loving you this way
But I'll never bring myself to say
Goodbye, girl
The sun is gonna make it's way around again
But the rain is always waiting just around the bend
There you go
Wrecking my whole world, one more hello
One more goodbye, girl, all fixed up
My goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
We wish you a Hairy Christmas, 
We wish you a Hairy Christmas, 
We wish you a Hairy Christmas and a Happy New Year. 
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin, 
Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year. 
Oh, bring us a figgy pudding, 
Oh, bring us a figgy pudding,

We won't go until we get some, 
We won't go until we get some, so bring some out here
We wish you a Hairy Christmas, 
We wish you a Hairy Christmas, 
We wish you a Hairy Christmas and a Happy New Year.
There's peanut dust and corn husk drifting through the air tonight
The marching band's warming up under the football lights
There's tractor trailers backed up down by the elevators
Train track grain car'll roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in
Pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up
And make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year
We missed the church bell's chime
It's harvest time
There's a thermos and a water jug
Rolling around in the cab
A set of socket wretches
Wrapped up in a greasy red rag
Bobby's mother pulls in the field
Bringing us supper
We grab a bite and make sure to hug her
Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in
Pay the loans down
Fill the diesel tank up
And make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year
We missed the church bell's chime
It's harvest time
At a quarter to two I kick off my boots
In the laundry room,
We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon
'Til its all done until we're all done
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in
Pay the loans down
Fill the diesel tank up
And make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year
We missed the church bell's chime
It's harvest time
It's harvest time
Talk about an uphill battle
Two thousand acres of beans and cattle
But he don't ever get rattled
He just goes 'til the sun goes down
Hydraulic fluid on his jeans
Red dye diesel and ten rows between
A cold one on the porch and a good nights of sleep
Y'all hold 'em up with me now
Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife
That loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer
Subdivision's creeping on in
Neighborhood kids keep jumping his fence
He could double his money
But that'd be the end of a promise he'll never break
'Cause he looked his daddy in the eye
And he's got that stubborn pride
He'll be here 'til the day he dies
No, he wouldn't have it any other way
Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife
That loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer
Yeah, here's to the farmer that loves his day in the sun
Won't sell that old half-ton
Nobody knows better 'bout a hard-earned dollar
Just tell him how far he's gotta go and he'll go further
Here's to the farmer
Here's to the farmer
Thank you, boys
Oh
Oh
What you doin' in this place?
(Well, I could probably ask you the same thing)
Another round, girl, what you think?
(If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink, some, make it 707)
Do you want it on the rocks?
(A double shot of heaven)
Spilling out the top
And we'll go
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(I'll send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
Slow country from a cover band
(I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want we could grab a cab)
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab so let's go
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture

I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
(So, let's not let it end, let it end right here)
Girl, you're going home with me, so let's go
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
Put your drink down, throw your camera up

Home alone tonight
(No, I ain't going home alone tonight)

Home alone tonight
First time I tied a plastic worm on and felt him on the other end
It was get the net, get him in the boat
Yeah buddy, I was hooked on it
First time I heard Chattahoochee on the speakers of my radio
I was topping off the tank on my old tune tone it
I was hooked on it
Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it
The first time I got that Gulf Coast white sugar sand on my feet
Saw the sunshine dancing on that clear blue water
I was hooked on it
First time I pulled me a long neck bottle from the bottom of a bucket of ice
As soon as that cold beer hit my lips 
I was hooked on it
Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Come on
 
Like a Friday payday honky tonk buzz
I gotta have a little more of it just because
I keep coming back to the good stuff, 'cause I'm hooked on it
Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life's all in my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Yeah, I'm hooked on it
I'm hooked on it
Hungover in a hotel room
Cell phone's dead
You're stretched out next to me
Lost somewhere in a dark whiskey dream
Hungover in a hotel room
Call the concierge
Two bloody mary's and some cigarettes
So you can wake up to breakfast in bed
Hear your voice in my head
Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out
Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room
Slide the curtains back
Light up the morning on the balcony
Look at you stirring in the shadows and sheets
Last night on repeat
Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out
Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room
There's that smile driving me wild
Call the front desk, late check out out request
You know, better yet, book it for another night
Room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room
Hungover in a hotel room
Hungover in a hotel room
If I could make a living walking in the woods
You could bet I'd be sitting pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheeling and dealing and sitting there reeling 'em in
A huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning and late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Well I'd get a little farm-pond bus
Sound of gravel when I'm backing up
And pulling the string on a nine-point-nine-two stroke
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tucking her hair in my hat and she's ready to go
We get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning and late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich, Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Well huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the morning and dark of whiskey in the evening
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you'll wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Yeah
It took me and four of my buddies
Half the night to pull out my truck
I stood there and proclaimed to everybody
It's the last time I'll mess with this mud
The boys they all grinned
And two nights from then
I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
I did it again
I took my first sip of cold beer
And tried not to spit it back up
I set it back down on that tailgate
Told myself I'd had enough
Then like a real man
I took hold of that can, and
I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
I did it again
I guess I'm a slow learner, I ought to know better
Than to do what I do, but I ain't no quitter
The other night we got a little rowdy
I woke up with one eye swole shut
Yeah things got out of hand at that party
I said that's it, it's 'bout time I grow up
But that next weekend, I called all my friends and
I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
Yeah what any old country boy'd do
I did it again, I did it again
I done done it again, I did it again
You know I got me a spot somewhere
Come on
There's a little place down the old road
Nobody but me and the whole world knows
Been going there ever since I was a kid
On my red dirt bike, and my blue Texan
Spend a lot long summer nights
With the hood out in the satellites
Ain't the kind of place that I ever shared
But come on with me, and let me take you where
I do my barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky
Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
And when the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there
There's a big oak on the other side
Where I took my grandpa's pocket knife
And I carved their names with tears in my eyes
When we join grandma, and the by and by
Got them right here in the dashboard box
Tip broke off and the blade don't lock
But I'd better carve our names just fine
If you wanna come along with me next time
I do my barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky
Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
And with the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there
Yeah, I done some barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the big man in the sky
Baby, jump on in, there's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there
Right there, ha ha ha
Girl, I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue,
Are pulling me in like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me to slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down, and get outta town
Got the stars comin' out,
Over my hood
And all I know now
Is it's going good
You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on,
Or where we've been from starin' at you
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end
Gonna cuss the morning,
When it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun,
Ain't no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile,
Land on my lips
And get drunk on your kiss
The clock on the dash,
Says 3:35
There's plenty of gas,
And the night's still alive
You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowing losing hold of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on,
Or where we've been from starin' at you
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end
You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowing losing hold of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on,
Or where we've been from starin' at you
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end
I don't want this night to end
No I don't want this night to end
The secret way long shadows bleed into the night
The desperate way leaves in the fall hold colors tight
The way that thunder knows the taste of summer rain
I knew you that way
The way cool mountain waters dance down to the sea
Bound by something strong but still so wild and free
It gives into the passion of the path it takes
I knew you that way
I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way
The way that skin on skin can start a crazy fire
That no one sees but burns all night long with desire
The quiet ease that makes a lover wanna stay
I knew you that way
I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way
The holy way that love knows it should never end
The sacred way the stars got sailors home again
Like teardrops know the words to Amazing Grace
I knew you that way
I knew you that way
I knew you that way
I'm gonna put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Take a deep breath
Try to keep my cool
I know you're gonna be there
I'm gonna have a couple drinks, just to knock off the edge
Not too much, don't wanna make a fool of myself
I know you're gonna be there, I know you're gonna be there
And I'm gonna bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm gonna pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just wanna see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there
You love the band that's playing, you wouldn't miss them for the world
All our friends are coming out and if I know one thing, girl,
I know you're gonna be there
Gonna walk right by that table where you always like to sit
And when I run into you, it's gonna be an accident
I know you're gonna be there
I'm gonna act like it ain't nothing, but another Friday night
And you're just some old friend and I'm doing just fine
Like I'm only going out to shake off another week
Maybe see the boys and catch a buzz somewhere
But I know you're gonna be there
And I'm gonna bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm gonna pull her in real close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just wanna see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there, I know you're gonna be there
I'm gonna put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Truth is when I see yah, I don't know what I'll do
T-shirt, blue jeans 
Don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscut 
Ain't no redeye gravy on a biscut
My deep Southern drawl 
Makes the conversation crawl
You're gonna have to hang around 
Long enough to hear me out
Some folks aren't happy like they are
Some wanna take things just a little too far

Singers wanna be Hollywood actors
And millionaires wanna ride old farm tractors
I'm just what I am 
I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy 
I'll stay me
My granny and pawpaw 
Still missing hee-haw
I love my little town 
Where the people don't let you down
There's a girl down the street 
Got a kiss just waitin on me
Hot dog sweet potato fries 
When I go over tonight
She knows exactly who I am
A soft touchin' her love loving 
Hard working man
Quarterbacks wanna play lead guitar
And supermodels want smaller body parts
Change is good sometimes 
But I still believe
I'm gonna make it easy 
I'll stay me
Yeah, singers wanna be Hollywood actors
And millionaires wanna ride old farm tractors
I'm just what I am 
I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy 
I'll stay me
I'll stay me
I'm gonna make it easy
I'll stay me
We got beer, and a tub,
And some good lookin' girls
Dressed to the nights,
Lookin' for a good time

Jacked up trucks, stacked in thick
White rocks stuck, in the mud grips

And a big 'ole bouncer at the door
But don't show him your I.D.
And don't you dare step out on the floor

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And head your ass back home
If you ain't here to party

There's a little 'ole Louisiana band
Playin' a swampy jam and brown sugar tans
Lookin' so fine shakin' that thang
In the zydeco cage and purple rain

Raise your drink up in the air
And everybody sing along
Man, you're here all alone

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And carry your ass back home
If you ain't here to party

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and pick someone out
Maybe make out
And get their number in your phone
Man, the only way that you'll be
Goin' home alone is
If you ain't here to party

Yeah, you better be here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party

Throw your keys on the bar
You ain't drivin' your car
You're here with me
That's how it's gonna be

'Cause we're here to party, baby
Yeah, yeah whoa
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong Friday night
It feels like I woke up one morning
And it all changed without warning
I don't know how our paths crossed
But all I know is I've been lost
Now it's hard to think
That we were ever strangers

Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl

I talk about being caught off guard
Talk about an old boy falling hard
Think about a few weeks flying by
And talk about losing track of time
Now I'm counting every second until I see her

Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl

I was cool with hanging around
Now I got plans bigger than this town
Saying things I ain't never said
And being with her ever chance I get
Heard the old man say son when you know
Hold on tight and don't let go
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl
She called and said she wanted to see me
I say, "Yeah, that's fine, baby, drop on by"
I figured I could make it better
Just like every other time we had this fight
Of all the kind of over it could've been
I never would've bet on this

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over it's just over

When she left the kitchen, she left no questions
I said where in the world did I go wrong?
And it don't matter where she's headed
She's gone, gone, gone

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over it's just over

Like the page, she's turning over
Like the light, she's starting over
Without me

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over, it's just over

It's just over
Yeah, it's just over
It's just over
What gives you courage to walk up to a ten in a bar
What turns the nervous into a rockstar
What gets you through the week then
And right on through the weekend
And puts you back together again

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mm hmm so good, mm hmm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip

What makes a good ol' boy start pumping his fist in the sky
What makes a shy girl walk on the wild side
What makes a party better
Makes it last forever
Everybody all together now

Take a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mm hmm so good, mm hmm so nice

But you ain't gonna last long

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mm hmm so good, mm hmm so right
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip

Takin' one of them big ol' sips
Hop in, you and me, little back road, barely see
Right song, radio
Throw in row, and drive slow
I saw you, and it lit me up
A girl like you it's just too much
Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can let some sparks fly
We can make the dark fly
Feel the ride, take me high
Yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow skirt, in the middle of nowhere
Skin to skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights
We can feel all the way through
Let me just hold on to you
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can
And kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can let some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
Yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow skirt, in the middle of nowhere
Skin to skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights
Don't it feel right?
Until the sun rise
We can just grow old, what we know
Can't help
The more I want you
You wanna do this don't ya
Come here let me pull you closer
You reach over
And kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can let some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
Yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow skirt, in the middle of nowhere
Skin to skin, don't care where we've been
Skin to skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights
Kill the lights
Baby you and me kill the lights
Kill the lights
All we do right is make love
And we both know now that ain't enough
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
God I ask you what's wrong
Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leaving dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Baby who we are just didn't work
But maybe we can leave with something out all this hurt
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leaving dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leaving dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Let's kiss tomorrow goodbye
You don't know why, you can't make it stop
You were hooked with your daddy's hand-me-down flat top
The first time that you made your first love cry
And the words you wrote were running from her eyes
Down on the paper, made you feel so alive
So you packed up your pickup and crossed that Tennessee line
You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
Find your old guitar, write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Everybody's got a story that needs to be sold
And they pray someday they'll hang a little gold
And ride back to their hometown with their head held high
On any given day, there's a dream, there's a chance
That lightning will strike at the end of a pen
And all the leaving, and losing, will all be worth the fight
So you're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You take that loan dot job just to pay the rent
You learn a few things from them hard-working men
You listen to 'em laugh and you listen to 'em curse
You find your old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
Some will come and some will go
If you don't lay it all out there, you'll never know
You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told, boy, you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
You find that old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
Oh oh oh
In the land of a million songs (oh oh oh)
Yeah I've iced down a few thousand beers in my day
To put down twice as many
No telling how many bonfires have lit up my face
If it ain't hundreds, it ain't any
I stood on this stage so many times
And watched all my friends have the time of your life
But there's something in this spring time air tonight
Yea we're gonna do it up right

Like we ain't ever
All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good
Like we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

This ain't the first time we've
Partied under these stars
Making a hangover
Well, this time I got a few more songs
In this old guitar
For you to pull your baby closer
You pull your baby closer

Like we ain't ever
All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good
Like we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

There's something in this spring time air tonight
But we're gonna do it up right
Let's do it up right

Like we ain't ever
All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good
Like we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

Like we ain't ever

Like we ain't ever
I watch you tell everyone
That she is your only one
But I see the other side
Know all the things you try to hide
Man, you put you up a real good front
You thinking you've got everyone
But you ain't got me fooled
I see right through
If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
Think you go as simple as you walk away
There ain't too much you even gotta say
You don't have to hurt her anymore
It's just a turnin' of a door
And don't you worry about bein' gone
'Cause she won't want for nothing too long
'Cause I see what you couldn't see
And I wanna be what you wouldn't be
If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
No, no, no
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
I wanna love her, I wanna love her, I wanna love her
Like you say you do
I wanna love her, I wanna love her
Like you say you do
I know, I know it, baby
Sounds like your day's been crazy
I just wanna hold ya
All the weight that's on your shoulders
Anything that's wrong
Let me, let me love it gone

Come on and trust me, honey
I can turn those raindrops sunny
Let me untie that tangle
Put on that kissing angel good morning song
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it, let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone

Why don't you slip into
Little something off the secret menu
Kick back, and let down your hair
Yeah, that one right there looks so damn good on
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
I got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it, let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone

So long

This night looks good on you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it
And every little inch of you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
I got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
A long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list

Let me love it, let me, let me love it
Baby, let me love it gone
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot
I believe most people are good
And most mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose
I believe most people are good
And most mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last
I believe most people are good
And most mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good
Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard to a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

M-O-V-E, I love it yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live old Moonlyn
When that song hits
Damn, you turnin' loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

M-O-V-E, I love it yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live old Moonlyn
When that song hits
Damn, you turnin' loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you

Move like you do
sexy and smooth
Like you love to
girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live old Moonlyn
When that song hits
Damn, you turnin' loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playin' throwback tune
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No I can't move when you move
No I can't move when you move
It flows underneath the 32 bridge,
And cuts through the heart of South Georgia
Big copperheads and mean wild pigs,
And gators in the weeds waitin' for ya
I leave my phone in the truck,
I leave my truck at the road
My four-wheeler gets me where I wanna go
I leave the world behind,
I pull my hat down low,
Get back to my roots, by a full moon glow
I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild here
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stomp
And a catfish line going, bom bom
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water
Daddy brought me down here when I was a kid
Taught me how to bait a crawfish basket
From the time I was old enough to walk
He had me running down squirrels and rabbits
I feel right at home in this neck of the woods
If this was all I had, I'd be living good
So let the stock market do what it's gonna do
Let the dollar go down and gas soar through the roof
I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild here
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stomp
And a catfish line going, bom bom
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water
I'm free, and I'm me
Being everything that I wanna be
Nobody chucking with me,
No sign of the city lights
Hell with the city lights!
Well I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild here
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stomp
And a catfish line going, bom bom bom
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even holler
When I get my feet in that Muckalee Creek water
That Muckalee Creek water
Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet

It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Lookin' good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad

It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco

I flipped it over up on Arnot Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in the beach bar parking lot

No it ain't hard to pick me out
'Cause it's the only one in this town

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Lookin' good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad

It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco

Yeah it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Lookin' good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still tear up a backroad

It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco
My ol' Bronco
Where you've been hiding all week girl?
I been all over this beach girl
In every bar, in every place
Somehow I missed your pretty face
But you knocked me off of my feet girl

Yeah in the morning I'll be gone, gone, gone
Oh baby that's just wrong, wrong, wrong

Wish I had met you on night One
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up
Waking up no, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd

Seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours
Feeling like this
Slow down, son
I wish I woulda met you on night one

Let me dry those tears from your eyes girl
Let's make the most of our time girl
Still got the rest of this night
For me to hold you so tight
'Fore we say our goodbyes girls

Seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this

I wish I woulda met you on night one
Yeah yeah
I wish I woulda met you on night one
I wish I woulda met you on night one
O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O holy night!
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O holy night!
It's just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
It's like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Anywhere you gotta be?
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl?
My out of nowhere girl
Girl are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend?
All of my life I've been here, never seen you before
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
I gotta know you and hold you
I don't wanna leave here alone anymore
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Anywhere you gotta be?
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl?
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We could go anywhere you want
Baby I got you
You know I got you
When you walked in this place, you turned it up
Right when I saw you
Baby I saw you
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Anywhere you gotta be?
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl?
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl
 
My out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl
Out of nowhere girl
There's a bonfire burning
Got Bocephus blaring 
Louder than allowed out in our neck of the neighborhood
If you wanna see follow me over the river through the woods
When the bugs and the beer start biting
There's bound to be some friendly fighting
Usually little Becky Lee winds up jumpin' up on somebody's hood
Don't she dance good?
Join the crowd gather round
Over the river through the woods
Just follow my tail lights out past the streetlights 
A left then a hard right, they're goin' all night
We'll do a little what we want 
After one long week of doin what we should
Over the river and through the woods
At first I thought she was kiddin 
When she mentioned skinny dipping
She said follow me through the trees 
Yes siree unless I misunderstood
We'll splash and splish with the fish 
Over the river and through the woods
That's my beer can next to her beer can 
Next to my work pants up there on dry land
We'll do a little what we want 
After one long week of doin what we should
Over the river and through the woods
That's my sore head layin on my truck bed 
Eyes blood shot red hearing what my mama said
We did a little what we want 
After one long week of doing what we should
Over the river and through the woods
Yeah, over the river and through the woods
I put a fishing rod by your bed
Right next to a Bible
I leaned a guitar in the corner of your room
With some Milsap on vinyl
I figured the best thing I could do 
Was put a thing or two
And that it wouldn't hurt to have in your way, on your path
Hoping you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it to you
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up
Early to rise, headin' to work
Open a door for a stranger
Yes sir, yes madam, red dirt on my hands
Showing you the best way I can
So you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it to you
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up
Dancing and kissing your Mama in the kitchen
Treatin' her like a princess, hoping you might pick it up one day
Hoping you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it to you
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up, pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up, yeah
I hope you pick it up
You just pick it up
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', no way she ain't got one
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is
She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again
I'd have gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up
She was like, oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe it came back on, but here it is
She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I brought out my guitar
She was like, oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is
She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights
She gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again
Time is tight and money's short
River's up and the weatherman 
He's calling for another storm
Pressure's on, the margins thin
Gotta figure out a fix for this awful fix I'm in
Oh, mama, what am I gonna do
She said, "Child, there's only one thing you can do"
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Pray about everything
Love is blind, fate don't care
Lose your grip and your balloons 
Go sailing off into the air
Oh, mama, what am I gonna do
She said, "Child, there's only one thing you can do"
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Yeah, pray about everything
Yeah, take a walk, take a breath
Oh, give it all a rest
Take a cane pole to the fishing hole 
And catch a couple fish
And just like that toss 'em back 
And make a little wish
Don't worry 'bout nothing 
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout it stress about it, fret about it 
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Yeah, pray about everything
My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss kick the dust, sayin' son its way to dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Ain't nothin' like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringin' out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When the tin roof gets to talkin' it's the best love we've made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they wanna cuddle
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, ha ha ha
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says "Hello"
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in

You can't escape it if you wanted to, you don't
Know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded walking
South down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You wait

Used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control

You're blindfolded walking
South down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade

You can't escape it if you wanted to, you don't
Know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded walking
South down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade

She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
Cut you like a razor blade
She cut you like a razor blade
She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her
When we spent that last week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted, yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster
We didn't have no downtown strip
We'd all pile in and take a two mile trip
To where the road runs out
Sit there and sip on whatever anybody's older brother could get
Where we worked in the dirt and fell in love
Got my heart broke, broke down my truck
Trying to spin out, show off in that mud too many times

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

I don't get back near enough
And just like these fields yeah, we all grow up
And it takes a little more than a paper cup to get dizzy
This hundred acre stretch is buried in my bones
Don't matter how long that I've been gone
I can be anywhere and some song comes on
And it's like I never left home

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around on a Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
Just like the scarecrows
Find me a place in the sand
Clean these old shades off
Damn, y'all don't understand
All she wants to do is dance

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high

Don't nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch how she makes this beach
Light it up like the sky on New Year's Eve
Love it when she's locked on me

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

Come on!

She said, "Boy, it's time to take me home"
Don't even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down beneath full and moonshine
You 'bout to be all mine

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

Clouds roll by
She get me high
Hey!
Running kind of late, got her makeup half on
Touch it up good enough
Oh, whatever
All her girlfriends waiting outside on her
They've been blowing up her phone
Girl come on, get yourself together
Got her hands up she's so ready with her driver on the way
Skips the damn line, she ain't even gotta pay
She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops wanted
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white t
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one
She's dancing like every guy in here ain't watching her
Do her thang, make it rain
(God to mighty?)
She's breaking necks, got them spilling beer
Putting that bartender through a year or two of Junior college
She's about to get the Dolce Vita's on the bar
It's all but all over the minute she starts
Feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops wanted
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white t
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one
Like the summer heat where she comes from
She's burning me down
Just look at her now
Just look at her now
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)
She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one wanted
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white t
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one
There's a fifty-fifty chance
That the room ain't ready
Odds are, the cooler's too heavy,
To tote down to the beach all by myself
I'd be willing to bet,
By the end of the week
I'll pass out in room 319
And to round up all my clothes
I might need a little help
But it's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
'Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight
I think it's safe to say
I'll make a few new friends
Take us out at a bar
Throw a beer on the band
Toss down head into a parking lot road
And I wouldn't be surprised
If my ex shows up
Huggin' all over some dude in his truck
I guess down here
That's the way things go
But I'll be fine
'Cause all I know
It's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
It's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
'Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight
'Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight
I saw a truck backin' outa your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over 'cause I couldn't believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody 'round our towns been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein' in the dark
Goodbye's ain't ever easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I ain't leaving 'till I hear you say what's goin' on
It'll be what it will be, it's either him or me
Give me the word and girl I'm gone
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein' in the dark
Goodbye's ain't ever easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, goodbye ain't ever easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?
You looked at me like I was crazy
When I said mam'm to that little old lady
You ain't heard talk like that lately
But I can see, it's got you smilin'
And you say you still remember
Our first date me cookin' you dinner
And how I didn't even try to kiss you at the end of the date
'Cause I was raised to
Stand up when you walk in the door
Spin you around an old hard pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old live oak road
Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
This southern gentleman
I'm gonna, open up these plantation blinds
To the sun coming up in your pretty blue eyes
Tell you you're beautiful a thousand times a day
'Til your in love with the way that I
Stand up when you walk in the door
Spin you around an old hard pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom

Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than

Girl I'm gonna take you on a trip like back in time
Just put your hand in mine, and won't you
And won't you come here when you walk in the door
Let me spin you around this old hard pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old live oak road
Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
Can't nobody gonna love you better than
This southern gentleman
It was the last night at the Holiday Inn, there was a fire on the beach
I was trying to talk to some other girl and she was bird dogging me
I finally had enough, I pulled over to the side
Brushed her hair back and looked her strait in the eye
It was a spring break-up, baby don't cry 
You ain't from here and neither am I
We gotta little drunk and had a good time
It's a Spring Break-up, 
Baby, bye bye, bye bye bye bye, 
Baby, bye bye bye bye bye bye
No I don't need your number, don't want to be your Facebook friend
I hate to break it to ya, but you won't ever see me a-gain
If I'm a bad guy, well I don't mean to be
But there's a beach full of buddies acting just like me
Spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
I know we gotta little drunk, we had a good time
Now it's a Spring Break-up, baby bye bye
Bye bye to the night that we shared
The memories we made on that ol' beach chair
So long to the beer in that kiss
Hope it don't take you long to get over this
Spring break-up, baby don't cry 
You ain't from here and neither am I
I know we gotta little drunk and had a good time
Now it's a Spring Break-up 
Spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
We gotta little drunk, and we had a good time
Now it's a Spring Break-up 
Baby bye bye, bye bye bye bye, baby bye bye, bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye, bye bye bye bye, baby bye bye, bye bye bye bye
You can take the house and everything in it
Keep the diamond ring 'cause that's how I meant it
Sticks and stones are all they ever were to me
This material life with all it's value
Don't mean a thing to me without you
The love that we once had is all I need
So take everything we have if it makes you happy
But darling let me say before I leave
These sticks and stones ain't all that makes a home
They don't have arms to hold you when love goes wrong
Now you say we are through
Those sticks and stones may break me
But the words you said just tore my heart in two
Remember when we didn't have a dime between us
You took my hand and said we don't need much
Just as long as we're together we would be fine
Now we've acquired all I thought would please you
I gave everything you know that I could
And still you're telling me you're not satisfied
So take everything we have if it makes you happy
But darling let me say before I leave
These sticks and stones ain't all that makes a home
They don't have arms to hold you when love goes wrong
Now you say we are through
Those sticks and stones may break me
But the words you said just tore my heart in two
These sticks and stones may break me
But the words you said just tore my heart in two
One
Two
I grew up just west of the tracks
Holdin' me to hold me back
Around your door she's callin' out my name
I come in at 5 a.m. 
And she is waiting for me
She said "where have you been?"
I said I was out
She said "you're no good 'cause you're running without love"
And I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell (to hell, woo hoo)
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell (oh, I'm gonna burn it down, baby)
The black widow and the ladies' man
Met down at the laundromat
And tried to make me understand
And just then her mother burst in
And said "you're the son of that bitch, you're no wind
Get out of my house
And hit the road"
And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones song
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell (oh, straight to hell)
And I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell (oh, hell boy)
The stars came out and warmed me so
As I walked on down the road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase steered me clear
She took my hand as we walked into the sun
A new day's promise had just begun
We'll make it alone whether you like it or not
And I turned around and shouted "help me, mother!"
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell (oh yeah)
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell 
Oh Lord, help me
Yeah, I'll bring the whiskey boys
Y'all taking it with me
Help me Jesus, help me Jesus
We all know
Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let's don't talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we'll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It's time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain't holdin' nothin' these two hands
Until they're holding you again

Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

I don't wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes

And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Back again in the back of this pasture
Sweatin' bad in the cab of this tractor
I oughta be worried about the rain
The last hundred rows could've been a little straighter
Guess I'll be hittin' them again later
I could turn this red dirt all day, yeah

Dreamin' 'bout sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips

Behind the dust is a big ol' blue sky
Kinda reminds me of those blue eyes smilin' back at me
I slide up a gear and go a little faster
Just a little breeze and I'm right back there
And I can almost feel

Her sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips

Oh, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips

Sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And one sweet, sweet memory of layin' on the beach
With her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
(It's 'bout that time a year again!)
It was bumper to bumper when I hit that county
So I stopped and let the top down

Speakers where a bumpin',
Little hip-hop somethin'
I was stirrin' up a coke and crown

Didn't even check in the room,
We went straight for the beach,
Didn't even give the ice a chance to melt

Now I'm scoutin' my spot,
Where we were gonna rock,
With the biggest buzz I ever felt

Now I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin' coconut covered girls

They keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand

Yeah, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand (Whoo!)

Hey there cutie with a Kentuky coozie,
Have you ever hung with a Georgia boy?
And why don't you and your friends,
Ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois?

Yeah I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin' coconut covered girls

They keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand

Yeah, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand

I gotta buddy who blew all his money,
And he had to stay his broke-ass home,
He's been goin' crazy, blowin' up my phone
Wonderin' to know whats goin' on

I tell him I'm sittin pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin' coconut covered girls

And they keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand

Yeah, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand (Yeah!)

Sittin' pretty, right here in Suntan City
It was two shades of brown and scratched up plastic
It held extra line, lures, hooks, and matches
And his last name engraved in black
Right there by the handle on the top
I'd slide it out of the back of his station wagon
Lug it down the bank with my arm draggin'
And I could hardly wait for him
To lift the lid on that tackle box
'Cause I'd sail with him across the South Pacific
Stand beside him on the bow of that battle ship
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
And watch him run to grandma, cryin' on the dock
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box
He'd bait my hook and keep on tellin' stories
'Bout nickel cokes, girls, and sandlot glories
Pickup trucks and peanut fields
Long before this town knew blacktop
I was almost ridin' with him shotgun down those dirt roads
Takin' turns on a jug of homemade shine
As he raced his buddies down through Mason Holler
Fillin' the sky with dust and kicked up rocks
He opened up, every time he opened up 
That old tackle box
He's been gone twenty years tomorrow
And I'm still holdin' on to this one wish
That God above would let me borrow grandpa
For one more afternoon and one more fish
And I'd sail with him across the South Pacific
Stand beside him on the bow of that battle ship
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
And watch him run to grandma, cryin' on the dock 
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box
Yeah, sure I love
Every time he opened up
That old tackle box
I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then I'll tell 'em what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues
I ain't sure were it all began
Somewhere 'round here I know
This bridge was a little more crowded then
I was playing her a tailgate show
And now I'm just sittin' here alone
To catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and a warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then I'll tell them what I lost
Oh I've got the tailgate blues
Damn that AM radio
For playing more than a song
My heart won't beat if the strings are broke
The melody's hittin' me wrong
Right here where she belongs
I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and a warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then I'll tell 'em what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues
The crickets heard my story and I listened to 'em sing
I guess I'll close the tailgate up
There ain't no telling what tomorrow might bring
Maybe me and a Dixie cup
But that won't be enough
Yes I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and a warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then I'll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues
I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and a warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well I worked all week, so I could come here
Have a good time and an ice cold beer
But one turned to ten and ten turned to twenty
And twenty plus an empty bottle's too damn many

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well it seems that I, misplaced my shirt
I cant find my keys for all this parkin' lot dirt
My fall back plan, has done got sad
'Cause my ex-girlfriend ain't lookin' half bad

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Help me up
Put me back down, put me back down

I sucker punched my best friend
And the bouncer head locked me on stage with the band
I I look like hell, I feel like shit
I think its time I call it quits

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Yeah, its time to take my drunk ass home
I twisted up my ankle, cant find my cell phone
Yea my lips all bust and my buzz is gone
Its time to take my drunk ass home

If y'all agree, then sing along
Its time to take, my drunk ass home

Oh somebody call me a cab, please
Homecoming parade 
You were the queen
I was riding right behind you
With the rest of the team
Saw my ring on your finger 
As you waved to the crowd
I didn't know a second stringer 
Could ever be so proud
The car in front of me was carrying 
What I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream 
Was in the car in front of me
On Wednesday nights 
We'd meet at church
You'd bring the kids 
And I'd come straight from work
Going home I'd read their lips 
Through the window of your van
As they sang Jesus loves me 
I thought God I'm a lucky man
The car in front of me was carrying 
What I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream 
Was in the car in front of me
Even after what the doctor said
You were strong and you believed
And you held us all together 
Through one more spring
Their little hands held on to mine
As we sat in that backseat 
With tears in our eyes
A long line of headlights
Strangers stopped along the road
No Monday wasn't meant 
For wearing Sunday clothes
The car in front of me was carrying 
What I loved more than anything
Oh, my sweetest dream 
Was in the car in front of me
Real sad story here y'all
Come on

I pulled her into my right
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun, maybe some quality time
We've had a rocky year
She wasn't ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning off my credit card
She was burning tires out in the parking lot

I think I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach

Oh well looks I've done it again
I ran another one off
Maybe I'm better off a single man
At least down here Panama City

Now that I'm free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag alone
Whatever y'all need, yeah, it's on me
So here's to me doing whatever the hell I want

Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach

I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess I can't control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need

'Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand that I brought to the
Yes I've lost the sand that I brought to the beach
The mix tape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on and thirty seven needles, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
Let's roll!
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you baby
This is how we roll
Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass is around and we dream about one day
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you traveled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back
Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back
To the moon and back
We met down at the floatin' dock
She snuck out scared, she might get caught
We were nervous, mmm but it was worth it
There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms it finally made sense
In that moonlight, I saw her tan lines
Every time my feet are danglin' in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lyin' there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doin' but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
The fog rolled in, she said "I better go"
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir she could keep
So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was wakin' up my life
To what love was, I can still see us
Every time my feet are danglin' in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lyin' there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doin' but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
Every time my feet are danglin' in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lyin' there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doin' but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
We were too damn young to know any better
Hey, baby, it's been a minute since
Me and you got caught up in a little wild and young
Kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around
We can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then, girl
Close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it

Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back
Down where I was born was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids
You either lived on a farm or wish you did
Jesus always walked close by our side
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks
There's a lot about life we learned on the bus,
How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got
We were poor, we were ugly, we were all best friends
White-eyed, baptized, and still wantin' to sin
Thank God we get more than just one shot
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks
That's us, haulin' hay in the field with the radio on
That's us, headin' straight into town when the work is done
In my mind, I can still see us now, 
Ridin' down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago
We thought tobacco and beer in a can
Was all it would take to be like our old man
But I saw how it made my momma cry
It was huntin' and fishin' and football games
Then it was girls, and everything changed
Fallin' in and out of love, we rode in trucks
That's us with our tailgates down in the parking lot
That's us with mud on our tires when it rained a lot
In my mind, I can still see us now 
Ridin' down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago 
It's apart of my soul, yeah
It's apart of my soul
Down where I was born, it was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
Where I grew up 
We rode in trucks
Yeah
We've been up here in this city
Livin' in the grease and grime
Girl it's a doggone pity
We ain't been gettin' any time
I've been preachin' 'bout back home
How it can make you feel so alive
Tell ya what we can do,
Baby let's me and you take a little drive
Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
There ain't no card in your pocket
If we're gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everything around here
That's just the way it's been for so long
How'd you like a coke in a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wreckin' my truck
Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
That straw in your hair,
Not an ounce of makeup on ya
As the sun goes down,
Girl I ain't never seen you lookin' so good
As you do right now
Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
Right there's an old step side
How 'bout that blue sky
So pretty it'll make you cry (Welcome to the farm)
We can roll on over yonder
Or sit right here and ponder
Watch the wind whirl by
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
There's a house fly swimmin' in my sweet tea
Hey darlin' pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin' off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air
Two hundred mile marker signs from nowhere
That's what country is
It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is
When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour 'till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
And when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is
It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is
It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no-cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with
That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is
Girl there ain't no way you don't know
How pretty you are
Every mirror in this two lane town knows
The trouble you cause
I'd give anything to take that beer back
I sent your way
I shoulda just took a shot of warm whiskey
And called it a day

Girl you make me wanna love
You make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase
Or just something you do
What is it with you

Are we in, are we out
Why you running me around
Why you having such a damn hard time
Girl with the truth
What is it with you

I spent half the day all hungover
The morning after your kiss
I knew the second that you showed up baby
It'd be another week of this
I keep praying that you mighta left something
Something when you got undressed
Something that you wanna come back for
Whatever you can do to get me back in your mess

Girl you make me wanna love
You make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase
Or just something you do
What is it with you

Are we in, are we out
Why you running me around
Why you having such a damn hard time
Girl with the truth
What is it with you

Oh I ain't me, I ain't right
But I'll admit I kinda like all of my heaven and hell
That you put me through
What is it with you
Girl you make me wanna love
You make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase
Or just something you do
What is it with you

What is it with you
Ooh, what is it with you
We've been gettin' beat up by this ol' life,
Seems all we got left is Friday and Saturday night 
And sometimes Sunday if Monday is a holiday.
I got a bunch of buddies I ain't seen in a while,
I got some good-time fun and hot dog buns in a stock pile, 
With some home brew, Malibu and Miller Lite.
Girl put on that short little party dress and make me a little bit jealous. 
It's gonna be a wild weekend,
Been on the phone with all my friends.
There's a little spot in the river bend
Were the sun sits high.
Long as the keg don't float and the ice don't melt, 
We'll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt.
Girl you can bet we'll fall in love again and again and again.
It's gonna be a wild, wild, wild weekend.
It's Friday afternoon and the countdowns on, 
Cell phone's singin' that All My Rowdy Friends Are Comin' Over Tonight,
Bad to the bone rington, 
Come on, come on, come on, baby let's get gone.
It's bumper to bumper in the outbound,
And we're already gettin' down.
It's gonna be a wild weekend,
Been on the phone with all my friends.
There's a little spot in the river bend 
Were the sun sits high.
Long as the keg don't float and the ice don't melt, 
We'll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt.
Girl you can bet we'll fall in love again and again and again.
It's gonna be a wild, wild, wild weekend.
Ill put on the short little party dress, make me a little bit jealous, 
Get me thinkin' goodness.
It's gonna be a wild weekend, been on the phone with all my friends.
There's a little spot in the river bend 
Were the sun sits high.
Long as the keg don't float and the ice don't melt
We'll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt
Girl you can bet we'll fall in love again and again and again
It's gonna be a wild, wild, wild weekend
It's gonna be a wild, wild, wild weekend, yeah
We been needing this for a long, long time.
Oh my baby sure is lookin' fine
What's up man? How ya'll been? 
Throw me a ski rope
Ain't tryna to be hero
Just tryna cash a paycheck
'Til the clock hits zero
Make the most of these days left
Found a few shortcuts
Picked up a couple secrets
Don't have it figured out yet
But I've learned the hard way, it's
More drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Just trying to win life
Man, in a couple scrapes, I barely got out of
Got a couple scars, I kinda ain't proud of
But you can't be afraid to drive until the gas tank's empty
And if you're glass is half full, you better make damn sure it's whiskey
And be more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Watching those numbers on the scoreboard clock unwind
Still trying to win life
But if you lose yourself in someone else
Than maybe you don't lose at all
Just be more more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
And that hail Mary's coming down on the five yard line
And I'm trying to win life
Just trying to win life
I'll be trying to win life
Ain't enough hours in the day,
It sure does feel like all work and no play
Honey I know that the grass ain't mown,
The car ain't washed and the leaves ain't blown
I'm a get it just soon as I can,
Lord it's hard to be an everyday man
But darlin' if you're willin' when I get home,
I'll put the kids to bed and get you all alone
And we can
Work it out
Why don't we start right now?
Whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl its gonna be, workin'
Let's work it out
This ole world is so tough
Sometimes I think that I had enough
Back still hurtin', bills keep comin'
Boss still yellin', truck quit runnin'
Ain't no tellin' what'd happen next
Try not to break while I drive and text
But darlin' if you're willin' when I get home,
I'll put the kids to bed and get you all alone
And we can
Work it out
Why don't we start right now?
whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl it's gonna be, workin'
Let's work it out
Baby it's true, all I need is you
Just unplug the phone
Let me get you all alone
And work it out
Why don't we start right now?
Whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl it's gonna be, workin'
(I'll put the kids to bed) we gotta work it
(We'll unplug the phone) baby work it
(Come on baby) let's work it out
(Let me get ya all alone)
He asked me for a dollar, I said "Go get a job"
I turned up my collar and started walkin' off
He said "I don't blame you, I know what you think
I'd just spend your money, to buy another drink"
But you don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call
If you think it's just a bottle
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack
He showed me a picture, of two little girls
Wearin' Easter dresses, hair done up in curls
He said "God bless their mamma
She said I couldn't stay
And buddy if you're wonderin'
How could I throw it all away"
You don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call
If you think it's just a bottle
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack
If you never felt the fire
Running through your veins
If you've never seen the devil
Face to face
You don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
So brother just be glad, and tonight
Hold your kids, kiss your wife
And when you talk to God
Count up all your blessings
And thank the good Lord that
You don't know Jack
You don't know Jack
You and your Sunday mornings
Me and my Saturday nights
You and all your colors
Me and my black and whites
You and your lace and cotton
Up against my whiskey skin
Saving me the way you always do it
'Cause I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins and the gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain
You and your stained glass windows
Me and my cracked windshield
You and your quiet view
Me and my can't sit still
'Cause I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins and the gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain
Girl I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins and the gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You're my sweet rain
You make me want to hold you like a hammock on a summer day
Tell you how I'm gonna take your cares away
You make me want to
You make me want to roll down the river and around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to
You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to
You make me want to hang up the phone ride across town
Walk through you door and lay it down
Kiss you 'til you feel the truth
Yeah, you make me want to
You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
Yeah, you make me want to
Well, I never met a girl like you
That's got me thinking like I do
To hang up my hat and kick off my boots
But you make me want to
You make me want to
You make me want to
Baby, you make me want to
My shoulder still burns
My head still hurts
There's sand from your shoes in my floorboard
Lipstick on the straw, your crying eyes
I paint it in my rear view
My speakers still blast that song
That you turned me on to

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach followed me home

Still hear your words saying we can't do this
'Cause you're up there and I'm down here
Baby let's go on and face it

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach followed me home

I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause there you are, every time I close my eyes
It's like we never even said goodbye
It don't feel like you're really gone
You and the beach followed me home
Just a little taste won't hurt at all
But once I get a sip, I know I'm gonna wanna drink it gone, all gone
90 proof is an understatement
I get around you and I'm way past wasted
I can't think at all
Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
And every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey
Girl, you got a smile like a devil on my shoulder
Tempting me sayin', honey come over right now, right now
I know I shouldn't wanna, but I think I'm probably gonna
Even though I know I'm gonna be wakin' up hurtin' in the morning
Shoulda come with a warning
Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Yeah, and every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey
I'm addicted girl, I'm hangin' on
I'm a fool in love, I'm long past gone
Yeah, so, come on
Your mama should've named you whiskey
And I never should've let you kiss me
Oh, and every time you leave it hits me
Oh baby, your mama should've named you whiskey
I'm addicted girl, such a fool
I'm addicted girl, such a fool
I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan
My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay, I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I found my billfold
I cried oh no no
Good time Charlie got me now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah, girl, I must have really showed you
'Cause all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay, I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was Elvis rocking on the bar
Working the crowd pouring out my heart
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay, I must have did
What all my friends say

That's what all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I take another chance
Take a shot, take a fall for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you said
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I've been watching and talked down to you all night long
Girl it's so wrong
How we, don't even wanna dance with you
Flipping through his phone like he don't even see
You're too pretty to left alone
Sooner or later somebody's gonna take you home

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

You can sit there letting time pass
Looking at your nails, staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you, written on my face
I ain't gonna tell you what you wanna do
Cause you gonna do what you wanna do

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

It's the last song of the night
You take a sip and we locked eyes

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
Come on girl, won't you go with me
I ain't been doin to right
Since I met her last night
Some kinda burnin' breakfast 
Lost at work state of mind
We're meeting here because
She mentioned that she loves
This kinda sushi, veggie 
Raw and edgy natural stuff
But I'm feelin' out of place 
But baby's on the way
I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy 
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey baby's on the way
Ain't gonna try those lines
Been used so many times
Like "When you fell from heaven, 
Did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just gonna wear this smile
Sit back and talk a while
Pull a few questions from my 
"Get to know her better" file
Hey, it's a real good day 
'Cause baby's on the way
I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy 
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Something she's got got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey baby's on the way
Oh, yeah, yeah
It's just a simple case of can't wait
Gonna be great to see her again
Gonna be tough to hide what's inside 
And in my eyes when she walks in
Oh, I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way
Hey, yeah, my baby's on the way
Yeah, yeah, baby's on the way
Sun coming up through the blinds on your pretty face
I'm just laying in these tangled sheets, watching you walk away
We been deep in love, all messed up, and everything in between
From fly to fall, we tried it all
Girl, we been a lot of things
But baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we're better off, under covers
Yeah, we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Not one time, baby
Weather man calling for rain on Saturday
Girl, what you got goin' on, your place or my place?
When its tepid on the roof, ain't nothing like you
Doing what you do to me
When the lightning hits, I'll be kissing on your lips
Girl, the rest is history
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we're better off, under covers
Yeah, we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been

Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
No, no, no
Girl, you and me ain't talking much
I just slam the door and leave in my truck
There ain't nothing left for us?
I think enough's enough
I look down, see your name there on my phone
Then I hit ignore and just drive on
We've been living like this too long
And there ain't no reason to turn around
Baby, you can have it all
I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there, done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time was the last time, baby
I can only change who I am so much,
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back
I've been there, done that
Street by street and town after little down
Feels like I'm on the right road now
I bet you're wondering how, I could just walk out
I put you high up as I could
And I know I've done everything I should,
To try and make a bad thing good
I guess it just took too long for me to see,
That we ain't meant to be
I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there, done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time was the last time, baby
I can only change who I am so much,
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back
I've already been there, done that
I'll wake up and I'll start to second-guess myself
And I'll crave your touch oh but I know too well
But I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there, done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time was the last time, baby
I can only change who I am so much,
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So, I ain't coming back
No, I ain't coming back
I've been there, done that
Baby I've been there, done that
Honey suckle in the air, breese blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, under your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
Your my favorite song, won't you let me sing-a-long
Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and your
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, girl your looking so
Fine, with your beer in the headlights
Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby, boots stiring up the dirt
Cottonfield concert, you got the beautiful, I got the cooler full
Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and your
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, girl your looking so
Fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights,
Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere, nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
Ohhh ohh ohhh
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and your
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, 
Girl your looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
I'm feeling kind of banged up
Slow out of the bed
Neon noise and honkey-tonk wine ringing in my head
Last night I saw your car
I overheard your name
Pulled my hat down low, wouldn't want you to know I was in this shape

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

You filled it with your love
Then you drained it out
Sometimes I think you built it up
Just to break it down
Now that's really left
Is an emptiness inside
A river running cold, memories growing old
Dying right there on the vine

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

Yeah, they're still doing better
Better than my heart
Better than my heart
We were as young as we were dumb
When we piled in a ol' pile of junk
It was one for all, and all for one
A bunch of outlaws without a gun
Shootin' bad booze outta Dixie cups
Chasin' every girl that wasn't fast enough
No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day you still had us
Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yea brothers a light that don't come cheap
You fight you cry you lie you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers
I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall
It's a cowboy code it's an unwrote law
When you mess with one you gotta take us all.
Blood brother's closer than your next to kin
Thick as these and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yea brothers a light that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers
Time can fly on by
Everything can change
Until the day we die
We'll always remain
We'll remain
Yea yea yea
Blood brothers closer than you next of kin
Thick as these and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yea brothers a light that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers
Yea yea
Oh oh
Blood brothers
You're like a screen flashing insufficient funds
Cops knocking when the party's just begun
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup
A fumble on the one when my team was going up
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know

You're a buzzkill every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what that's not what's gonna be?
You walk right by crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill Baby, you're a buzzkill

I used to do everything I could do to do nice things
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change
Everybody knows you ended us
So, while you're showing up here on my side of the tracks
Slipping in this barn just to check out where I'm at
I was a six pack in, now I'm sober as a judge

'Cause you're a buzzkill every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what that's not what's gonna be?
You walk right by crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill

'Cause if it didn't hurt enough now I got to see you flirt
Nailed to the stool, watching you work
Don't you give a damn about how I feel
You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're such buzzkill

Yea, you're a buzzkill every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what that's not what's gonna be?
You walk right by crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill, you little buzzkill
How many butts can you fit in the backseat?
How many cans can you throw in a floorboard
Mama's credit card and your brother's I.D.
6 Bodies, one big good lord

Checkin' in to a good time

Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have
Keep chuggin' along
Keep singin' your song
Put that plow in the ground 'till the daylight's gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good times in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
And keep chuggin' along
Sometimes you get a bill in the mail
You don't know how you're gonna pay
Then your baby wraps her arms around you
And makes it all go away
Life's kinda funny like that
Sometimes you're the train sometimes you're the track
And when that sun goes down
And there ain't no goin' back
Keep chuggin' along
Keep singin' your song
Put that plow in the ground 'till the daylight's gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good times in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
And keep chuggin' along

And keep chuggin' along
Keep chuggin' along
Yeah keep chuggin' along
Hey!
Whiskey burns me up, wine turns my teeth all red
Tequila makes me loco, champagne hurts my head
But let me tell ya I'm a real big fan,of ice fishin' for them aluminum cans

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll
I'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger
king of the grill and a short putt sinker
I'm just a cold beer drinker

Monday through 5 o' clock Friday I'm a hard workin' man
Responsible, kinda dull, head-down, stick to the plan
But all my buddies know me better than that,
Get us all together and we start throwing 'em back

Hey girl, go on now!
You know you've got everybody lookin'
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate
Girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
The DJ spinnin' that country song
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me

Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony-tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn
Yeah, yeah, yeah

In the wind on the hill underneath the pines

Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you
And get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you
And get to lovin' you
'Fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks

Baby what are we becoming
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions everyday
I could lean in to hold you, or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I

Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving
Baby those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
Now I'm second guessing everything thing I see

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I

Still give you what you need
Still take your breath away
Light up the spark way down deep, baby do I

Whoa,
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life

Tell me baby do I get one more try
Do I, baby do I
I'm walkin' down the street, shufflin' my feet
Whistlin' a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Just  floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
The people downtown, are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me, I'm sittin' in the shade, soakin' up the day
Watchin' 'em all roll by
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Just  floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry!
I like it laid back, like a baby blue Cadillac
Easing on down the road
I like it nice and slow, layin' low
Rollin' anywhere that the wind wanna blow
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Just  floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Hey, hey
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Just  floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry
(I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing)
(Just floatin' on a breeze)
I'm just doin' my thing
(I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing)
(Don't worry 'bout me)
Come on,
(I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing)
(Just floatin' on a breeze)
(I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing)
(Don't worry 'bout me)
When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking led
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
So long my friend
Until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to
Sit right here on the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer
Drink a beer
Yeah
Out in the sticks
With the squirrels and the ticks
And my thirty-aught-six
I'm running out of miller light
Trucks in park
The dog wont bark
Couple hours 'till dark
Wishing one would walk by
Might as well left my gun in the gun rack
Been here all day all I killed a 12-pack
Sittin' here
Waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aiming at the empties
Missin' hittin' pine trees
Ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone
Saying baby come home
Where ya been and whatcha been doing
Well I've been sittin' here
Waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
The only deer I seen's
Been John Deere green
But that don't mean
That I got a raw deal
'Cause there ain't no boss
Callin' me hoss
Tickin' me off
On the edge of this corn field
On my second box of Winchester hundred grains
Ain't seen a big buck
But its been a good day
Sittin' here
Waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aiming at the empties
Missin' hittin' pine trees
Ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone
Saying baby come home
Where ya been and whatcha been doing
Well I've been sittin' here
Waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Sittin' here
Waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aiming at the empties
Missin' hittin' pine trees
Ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone
Saying baby come home
Where ya been and whatcha been doing
Well I've been sittin' here
Waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Sittin' here waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer
Wastin' bullets
Yeah
You're in the blue breeze blowin'
Across the sugar white sand
And the roar of the wheels
When I'm tryin' to land
In a Hank Williams tune
And a Coltrane song
In the dead of the night
And at the break of dawn
It never gets old
And it's always new
Everywhere I go
I keep on losin' you

In the words of a poet
No one reads anymore
In the shadows and sunlight
Crawling across the floor
In airport lounges
In motel rooms
In the Starbucks line
Under quarter moons
Between the little white lies
And the cold hard truth
Is everywhere I am
Girl I'm still losin' you

Yeah you kissed me one last time
Made that driveway gravel fly
Red taillights lit like a spark
Just the start of a long goodbye
And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So girl if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?

In Seattle and Vegas
Old rodeos
And lonesome dove
And the last pictue show
In a truck stop parking lot
Gasoline rainbow
The burn of the whiskey
Neon smoke
I close my eyes
And you're right there

Yeah you kissed me one last time
Making that driveway gravel fly
Red taillights lit like a spark
Just the start of a long goodbye
And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So girl if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?

Missin' you
Red wine, slow dance, kissin' you
Late night drivin'
Wishin' you were still here
Turnin' that radio
Searchin' for a song to listen to

And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So girl if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?
Guess I'll keep holdin' on
And I'll just keep on losin' you
Missin' you
Red wine, slow dance, kissin' you
Searchin' for a song to listen to
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
He was thinking back when he was a kid
His folks were divorced
His old man high on something
Came knocking at the door
His mama wouldn't talk to him
She said boy dontcha let him in
She was cussing and pacing and wasting her life
On that linoleum floor
He took him back to his old apartment
Turned off the TV
His beautiful broken hero on the couch
Passed out asleep
And he put 'em to bed
With tears in his eyes
He said dad I love you, goodbye
He headed out into the night
Seventeen years old
Fired up that rusty old pickup
Turned his collar to the cold
And he headed back to mama's place
Ready for his big escape
And he tiptoed up the stairs and left a note
In the cover's fold
It said mom I wish I could wave a wand
And make you smile again
Bring back the man who stole your heart
'Fore the demons got to him
If I stay here any longer
Something sacred's gonna die
He said mom I love you, goodbye
Took a lot of wrong turns on the road
Finding his life
By the grace of God he ended up
With a little boy and a wife
And the phone call came from his sister
It was that old familiar pain
His mother was at the doorstep
Of heaven's pure white light
At the end of the service
His father came up to him
Clear eyed and sober now he said
Boy Jesus took my sins
And I pray someday maybe you'll forgive me too
With tears in his eyes
He said son I love you, goodbye
His plane touched down in Texas
He pulled out his phone
Dialed in the number, got the machine
Of his old man's home
He said dad we got an extra room
And your grandson has your eyes
Couldn't say anything else
Cause he started to cry
And he choked out dad I love you, goodbye
Dad I love you, goodbye
Out with my friends and here it goes again
Somebody asks me where you're at
I don't know what to say, I've tried you everyday
It's been so long since you've called
I'll bet your having a real good time,
But I hate to think of what you're doing tonight,
And who you're holding close I don't really wanna know

Who you've been lovin' lately
Who you've been callin' baby
Who you've been runnin' around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?

I thought that I could trust the way we made love
You made me feel it was something real
Now everything you've said is lying in our bed
Like shattered glass against my back
The way you got me just blows my mind
Didn't care enough to even say goodbye
I'd give anything now if I could stop thinking about

Who you've been lovin' lately
Who you've been callin' baby
Who you've been runnin' around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?

Yeah who you been lovin' lately

I don't wanna know, but I've gotta know
I don't wanna know, I've gotta know
I don't wanna know, but I've gotta know
I don't wanna know, I've gotta know

Who you've been lovin' lately
Who you've been callin' baby
Who you've been runnin' around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?
Like we were nothin' baby, who you been lovin' lately?
Mary was the first of three
Long black hair and sugar sweet
Daddy's eyes and Momma's crooked smile
She was barely seventeen
Got a job keepin' dishes clean
Planned to stay in this city for a while
For a while
Joseph ran a lumber yard
About a mile from Olive park
Quiet boy, he never had much to say
It was love right from the start
He bought a ring and won Mary's heart
Had hopes for a home and kids someday
Kids someday
The angel scared her half to death
She would've screamed but she lost her breath
On a midnight there in the middle of May
He said "Oh Mary, don't be afraid
You'll bear a son that the Lord has made
Name him Jesus, He'll light the way"
She packed the clothes, he made the plans
They had to go to Bethlehem
But there was nowhere left to stay
So in a barn she gave birth
To the King of Kings, the Lord of Earth
Just a little bitty thing sleeping on the hay
Sleeping on the hay
The story's too long to tell
But He walked on water and lived through hell
Killed on a cross and rose from the grave
We got a King, they got a Son
Mary and Joseph were the only ones
There on that very first Christmas day
There on that very first Christmas day
May we all get to grow up in our red white and blue little town
Get a one star hand me down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thing, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much!
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new one
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
For you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free-fall
May we all
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of fame
This thing ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new one
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
For you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free-fall
May we all
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free-fall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)
May we all (yeah the last one)
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free-fall
May we all
I got an empty feelin' when that moving van pulled up
It got a little emptier as I walked them fill that truck
And when they carried out your clothes
It took my breath away
Now they're headed for that bed
The thought keeps running though my head
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
I'll pay them boys to stop right now
And leave that truck out by the curb
The TV and the phones packed up, so we won't be disturbed
There's not a light left in this room, just a shadow of a doubt
So let's make sure we don't give up
Before we've thought this through enough
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
Baby I think we both know it's gone wrong, wrong, wrong
And I know you don't think we can carry it on
Baby I think we both know it's gone bad, bad, bad
Think of all the good times we had
Driving to your house
Remember when we first met
Dancin' on a Friday night
Under the moon light
Talkin' till the night was gone
In the back of my truck with the radio on

Then that ol' song comes on
Together we're singin'
Forever we're singin'
When that ol' song comes on
Together we're singin'
Forever we're singin'
That ol' country song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby I think we both know
It's alright, alright
But how could I forget what you did that night
Baby you told me you loved me in Tennessee
Where we were gonna live
But now you've done a few things that I can't forgive
Driving to her house
Tellin' her you love her
Lying on a Friday night
Ring in your pocket
Lying to me all along
In the back of your truck with the radio on

Then that ol' song comes on
Together we're singin'
Forever we're singin'
I know we went wrong
But we belong
Together we're singin'
Forever we're singin'
That ol' country song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Then that ol song comes on
Together we're singin'
Forever we're singin'
I know we went wrong
But we belong
Together we're singin'
Forever we're singin'
That ol country song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
People ask me what you doin' son
You're gonna drive yourself insane
You'll never find the sunshine
When you're followin' the rain
Seems like I'd take a new road
After all these years
But I wind up on the same old trail of tears
I'm still walkin' down memory lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain
Recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame
Down on heartbreak avenue
I'm still walkin' down memory lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
I hate the way I loved you
But my mind keeps goin' back
My train of thought just won't get off
That same old worn out track
It's an every night occasion me and your memory meet
On that endless lonely street of broken dreams
I'm still walkin' down memory lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain
Recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame
Down on heartbreak avenue
I'm still walkin' down memory lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin'/into you
I'm still walkin' down memory lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain
Recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame
Down on heartbreak avenue
I'm still walkin' down memory lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin'/into you
Here she comes now
I'm still walkin'
Down memory lane
I'm still walkin'
Down memory lane
I'm still walkin'
Down memory lane
Lord, I'm walkin'
Down memory lane
Oh, I'm walkin'
Down memory lane
I'm still walkin'
Down memory lane
Yeah, cigarettes taste good to me
But the body is a temple I read so I
I ain't messin' with Jesus
I love drivin' fast down a country road
But a voice in my head says take it slow so I
I ain't messin' with Jesus

I wanna keep him on my good side
Keep him on my bad side a little less of the time
I never plan on being perfect
I'm a back-slidin' serpent of a man most of the time
But I walk the line
Until I get to the other side
No, I ain't messin' with Jesus

Yeah
Well, I got a dark side and I try to live right
So I stay up late and I pray all night 'cause I
I ain't messin' with Jesus
Yeah, I wanna do wrong in the middle of right
I wanna get drunk and have a good fight but I
I ain't messin' with Jesus, nah

I wanna keep him on my good side
Keep him on my bad side a little less of the time
I never plan on being perfect
I'm a back-slidin' serpent of a man most of the time
But I walk the line
Until I get to the other side
No, I ain't messin' with Jesus

Everything we do
You know he's gonna see us
So I don't mess with Jesus, nah
Everything we do
You know he's gonna see us
So I ain't messin' with Jesus
Hallelujah

Keep him on my good side
Keep him on my bad side a little less of the time
I never plan on being perfect
I'm a back-slidin' serpent of a man most of the time
But I walk the line
Until I get to the other side
No, I ain't messin' with Jesus
I wanna keep him on my good side
Keep him on my bad side a little less of the time
I never plan on being perfect
I'm a back-slidin' serpent of a man most of the time
But I walk the line
Until I get to the other side
No, I ain't messin' with Jesus
No, I ain't messin' with Jesus
I'm sittin' here stoned, at Tortilla Jo's
Nobody knows my name and that's alright with me.
She said adios, so I said hello
Don Julio, top shelf, self help remedy

Sure was good to know you
I still wanna hold ya,
But I know it's over.
You ain't coming back.
This ain't California,
I'm somewhere south of the border,
I'm in a mexicoma.
My my my my my my mexicoma,
I know it' over,
But the sun still shines on a fool like me.

You pulled the plug, on what I thought was love
But I got just enough juice to forget about you and squeeze this lime.
I can see the ocean (I can see the ocean)
I can feel the breeze (I can feel the breeze)
Almost can't remember how you left me, down here on my knees

Sure was good to know you
I still wanna hold ya,
But I know it's over.
You ain't coming back.
This ain't Oklahoma,
I'm somewhere south of the border,
I'm in a mexicoma.
My my my my my my mexicoma,
I know it' over,
But the sun still shines on a fool like me.

I'm sittin' here stoned, at Tortilla Jo's
And nobody knows my name and that's alright with me.

My my my my my my mexicoma,
I know it' over.
I'm in a mexicoma.

But the sun still shines on a fool like me.
Today he traded his big '98 Oldsmobile
He got a heck of a deal
On a new Porsche car

He ain't wearing his usual grey business suit
He's got jeans and high boots
With an embroidered star

And today he's forty years old going on twenty
Don't look for the grey in his hair
'Cause he ain't got any

He's got a young thing beside him
That just melts in his hand
He's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can

He's gotta a woman that he's loved for a long long time at home
Ah but the thrill is all gone
When they cut down the lights

They've got a business that they spent a while coming by
Been a long uphill climb
But now the profits are high

But today he's forty years old going on twenty
And he hears of sordid affairs
And he ain't had any

And the young thing beside him
He knows she understands
That he's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can

Oh, oh
Aw milk cow blues yeah
Aw Larry!
Ah Tim, c'mon tell 'em now!
I woke up this mornin'
Looked out my door
I can tell my milk cow
I can tell by the way she lows
If you see my milk cow
Please drive her on home
'Cause I ain't had no milk and butter
Since my milk cow's been gone
Well you gotta treat me right woman
Day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down on your knees and pray
You're gonna need, you're gonna need
My help one of these days
You're gonna be sorry
You treated me this way
I said well good evening
Don't that sun look good going down
I said well good evening
Don't that sun look good going down
And don't my home look lonesome
When my lover ain't around
Low
You know what low means
Sail on, sail on, sail on little girl, sail on
Sail on, sail on, sail on little girl, sail on
You're gonna keep right on sailing
Till you lose your happy home
Well I tried everything baby
To get along with you
Now tell me brother Tim
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cryin'
Gonna leave you alone
If you don't think I'm leavin' 
You can count the days I'm gone
You're gonna need me, baby
You're gonna need my love someday
You're gonna be sorry
You treated me this way
Ah milk cow blues
Ah milk cow 
Come on home
There's a girl
From back roads Tennessee
And she works in the factory
All day on the line
Then she clocks at five finally
And there's a bar
The boys treat her like a queen
She's the bell of the ball in blue jeans
And they all get a turn
Just to turn her around the floor
And they always want more
She says take me for one more song
Mr. Whoever You Are
Spin me around and pull me in close
And the band slows down
Then let's get the hell out of this bar
Mr. Whoever You Are
Mr. Whoever You Are
They dance
Melt to the heat of the song
Their bodies feel like they belong
And the boys hold on tight
Thinking I might get lucky tonight
And they're probably right
Yeah they're probably right
She says take me for one more song
Mr. Whoever You Are
Spin me around and pull me in close
And the band slows down
Then let's get the hell out of this bar
Mr. Whoever You Are
Mr. Whoever You Are
They hold onto her waist
She falls into the night
And she throws back her head
She looks up toward the sky
And she laughs
At all the pretty lights
And says take me for one more song
Mr. Whoever You Are
Spin me around and pull me in close
And the band slows down
Let's get the hell out of this bar
Mr. Whoever You Are
Mr. Whoever You Are
Aw Mr. Whoever You Are
Mr. Whoever You Are
I never had no one that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin' so tired of searchin'
Til you walked into my life
It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend

You stand by me you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
And oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Going to tell you how much I love you
Though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel
Wrapped in pink, so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger
Since the day you were born
You're beautiful baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know
The road that will lead you home again
Go on, take on this old world but to me
You know you'll always be my little girl
When you were in trouble that crooked little smile
Could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you
I turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes when you're asleep
I whisper I love you in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say
Daddy love you more
You're beautiful baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know
The road that will lead you home again
Go on, take on this old world but to me
You know you'll always be my little girl
Someday some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say yes to him
Unless I know he's the half that makes you whole
He has a poet's soul and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough
You're beautiful baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know
The road that will lead you home again
Go on, take on this old world but to me
You know you'll always be my little girl
I think I'll take a moment celebrate my age
End of an era and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

In my next thirty years I'm gonna have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years

My next thirty years I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doin' here in my next thirty years

For my next thirty years I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here in my next thirty years
In my next thirty years
My old friend, I recall
The times we had, hanging on my wall
I wouldn't trade them for gold
'Cause they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They're woven in the stories I have told, and tell again
My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
The running and the races
The people and the places
There was always somewhere else I had to be
And time gets thin, my old friend
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why
Don't know why

My old friend, this song's for you
'Cause a few simple verses was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
'Cause the love and the laughter
Will live on long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We'll meet again
My old friend...goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

My old friend
My old friend
Goodbye
Goodbye
It'd be just another river town
Streets would have a different sound
There'd be no honky tonks with whiskey rounds
No dreamers chasin' dreams down

No tourists takin' in the sights
No stetsons under broadway lights
No pickers playin' for pocket change
No rhinestone boots on an old church stage

Hey blue eyes, cryin' in the rain
Hey fire, burnin' round the ring
Hey crazy, you know it's true
That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you

No ghost of the man in black
No long white cadillac
No woman standin' by her man
In the place where it all began

Hey good lookin', hey momma tried
Hey gambler, hey country boy can survive
Hey jolene, you know it's true
That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you

Hey georgia, hey smokey mountain rain
Hey galveston, he stopped loving her today
Hey fancy, you know it's true
That nashville, wouldn't have
Blue eyes, cryin' in the rain
Hey fire, burnin' round the ring
Hey crazy, you know it's true
That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you

It'd be just another river town
Streets would have a different sound
Is your luck enough
Is your touch enough
C'mon girl
Can you keep it up
Is your bluff enough
Are you tough enough
Is your stuff enough
Can you start it up
Are you sharp enough
Let it roll, let em go, let em fly
Took a chance on a chance
But the aces were high
Get it on, give it up, give it in
You stole the wages of sin
Got to be in it to win
[Chorus]
Nine lives, nine times to die
I've been bitten once
But I won't be twice shy
Nine lives, nine times to die
Come on and show me your hand
Cause it's your time to cry
Have you lost your touch
Are the stakes too much
Did you spin the wheel
And could you close a deal.
Yeah, yeah!
Let it roll, let em go, give em style
Took a chance on a chance
But the deuces were wild
Get it on, give it up, give it in
You stole the wages of sin
Cause you're in it to win
[Chorus]
Hey!
Let it roll, let em go, let em fly
Took a chance on a chance
But the aces were high
Get it on, give it up, give it in
You stole the wages of sin
Got to be in it to win
[Chorus]
Nine lives, nine times to die
I've been bitten once
But I won't be shy twice
Nine lives, nine times to die
It's Russian roulette
With every roll of your dice
And nine lives is all we're gonna get
I said all we're gonna get yeah
Nine lives, nine times to die
You've just bitten less than your nine lives.
I was standing at the end of my rainbow
With no where to go and no pot of gold in sight
All my wishes were way too much to hope for
But when I saw you I knew I'd seen the light

And not a moment too soon
With not a minute to spare
You touched my heart when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour
When my world was filled with gloom
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon

I used to think that love would never find me
And the one who cares was lost somewhere in time
But when you found me I knew I'd found forever
You rescued me just before I crossed the line

And not a moment too soon
With not a minute to spare
You touched my heart when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour
When my world was filled with gloom
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon
Not a moment too soon
Stopped to have a few at five
Now you're crossing that center line for the third time
Second time like this this week, had a friend ask you for your keys
You said, "No, I'm fine."
You sure do act like you ain't got a thing to lose
But every car you pass might be the one you take with you

You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country, for your Jesus, for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
Well, you've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothin' to die for

So what's the harm in a little fun?
'Cause you're off to work before the sun everyday
And the inbox/outbox locks you in
And the money you make ain't worth the time you spend to make your pay
The doctor says, "Man, your numbers - they don't lie."
The graveyard's full of folks that didn't have time to die

You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country, for your Jesus, for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
Well, you've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothin' to die for

Straight through that guardrail up into that white light
You hear a sweet voice saying just this side of the other side
Just this side of the other side

You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country, for me and all your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
Well, you've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothin' to die for

Ain't nothin' to die for
Nothin' to die for
Ain't nothin' to die for, no
Oh, he listens to the countdown, every Sunday morning
From a cold solitary prison cell
And the music from his radio is like freedom down a dirt toad
Makes that eight by ten a brighter hill

Before he started doing all the hard time that he's doing
He was singing in them honky-tonks and dives
He dreamed of being somebody, now he's number 37405

Well she used to come and see him, every other weekend
And bring him all the news from way back home
It's been two birthdays since he's kissed her,
Five seconds since he's missed her
Now the perfume on those letters ain't that strong

He's got too much time to think about the night he had too much to drink
And all his buddies, they begged him not to drive
Mr. Life of the Party, he's now number 37405

Old judge on the bench said, "Son, your crime's got consequences."
It's what he told him, fifteen years ago
He took a life and that's a fact, he'd give his own to give it back
Today's the day he finally gets parole

He turns in them prison clothes, and stands there at the forkin' road
And mama prays and waits while he decides
And the angels close their eyes

Listens to the birds sing on a perfect autumn morning
Just down the road, rings an old church bell
On a lover's leap with a freeway view
Sittin' on my hood
Thinkin' bout you
Going over in my mind
Every kiss and every fight
Yeah the fool on the hill
Is leading down another night
There were days so hard
I thought I had to go
I'd get in my car
And just follow the road
But this is my home
And it's who I am
And I know I'd stay
If I could make this old town new again
Color other than blue again
I'd have something to do again
Instead of thinking about you again
But the people I know
The places I go
Remind me of you
Oh, won't somebody come around
And make this old town new
There were nights so long
I thought the sun burned out
And there were girls so wrong
I don't want to talk about
I was burning up the night
Yeah, in an alcohol flame
Lightin' up my way
Trying to make this old town new again
Color other than blue again
I'd have something to do again
Instead of thinkin' about you again
But the people I know
The places I go
Remind me of you
Won't somebody come around
And make this old town new
But the people I know and
The places I go
Remind me of you
Love goes wrong but life goes on
And I know what I gotta do
I'm just hangin' around
Tryin' to make this old town new
Your love for me, it didn't last long
One part right, and two parts wrong
One part love, two parts pain
One part sunshine, two parts rain
My friends told me you were slippin' away
I smiled and said I don't believe what you say
As long as they'll always be birds in the sky
Your love, your love for me, baby, will never ever die
Oh darlin'
Your love for me, crumblin; down,
One part truth and two parts lie
One part rock and two parts sand
One part stay and two parts ran
When you took one step I take two
I'm tryin' my best to hold onto you
But love can't be love without some give and take
And lovin; you too much was my greatest mistake
Oh darlin'
Oh the love that's in you is all that I need
But you just give one third to me
And all of your sweetness
Wouldn't last much longer
And If I had it all I wouldn't be much stronger
Your love for me, it didn't last long
One part right, and two parts wrong
One part love, two parts pain
One part sunshine, two parts rain
Your love for me, crumblin; down,
One part truth and two parts lie
One part rock and two parts sand
One part stay and, baby, two parts ran
Oh one part stay, and two parts ran
Used to chase that boy home from school 
We called him freckled faced red headed fool 
He was different he wasn't cool like me 
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones 
Bet we never left well enough alone 
And one day he ran away from home  you see 
And I passed him as he walked away 
And in his eyes I heard him say 
"One of these days you're gonna love me 
You'll sit down by yourself and think 
About the times you pushed and shoved me 
And what good friends we might've been 
And then you're gonna sigh a little 
Maybe even cry a little but 
One of these days you're gonna love me" 
Patty Sue was a small town beauty 
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me 
Lord knows she should've seen right through me 
When I promised her the world 
But at seventeen, you only want one thing 
I left her standin' there with my high school ring 
Innocent tears in the pourin' rain 
As I walked away 
And I still see her in my dreams 
And to this day she's whispering 
"One of these days you're gonna love me 
You'll sit down by yourself and think 
About the time you turned from me 
And what good friends we might've been 
And then you're gonna sigh a little 
Maybe even cry a little but 
One of these days you're gonna love me" 
Now everybody stands up 
The congregation sings 
It's a song of sweet forgiveness 
And as the chorus rings 
The wind blows clear my memory 
The pages start to turn 
Then suddenly I'm singin' 
The moment that I learn 
One of these days I'm gonna love me 
And feel the joy of sweet release 
One of these days, I'll rise above me 
And at last I'll find some peace 
Then I'm gonna smile a little 
Maybe even laugh a little but 
One of these days I'm gonna love me
Here's to the corners yet to turn
Here's to the bridges yet to burn
Here's to the whole thing blown apart
It's open season on my heart
The days go by like flying bricks
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix
I'd just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I can't blame anyone but me
This reckless fool I've come to be
My tired excuses just don't fit
It don't look good from where I sit
I've tried to change without much luck
I reached the point where I get stuck
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heart
I can't be something that I'm not
I can't give what I haven't got
I don't know where or why or when
I only know the shape I'm in
So here's to the clown down in the mouth
Here's to the whole thing going south
My own true love's turned poison dart
It's open season on my heart
Here's turning heartaches into art
It's open season on my heart
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, 'cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
Yeah,I can't shake it, no
I can't wait to see you
want to see if you still got that
Look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same thing
Over and over again
Oh but I think she's leaving on
And she's leaving here
And I don't know what else to do
(Can't go on not loving you)
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, 'cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no
I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath
You took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you
Or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps
Playing in my head
Over and over again
It play in my head
Over and over again
Oh but I think she's leaving on
And she's leaving here
And I don't know what else to do
(Can't go on not loving you)
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, 'cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no
Now that I realize
That I'm going down
From all this pain you
Put me through
Every time I close my eyes
I lock it down
Oh, I can't go on not loving you
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, 'cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, 'cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no
This rock we're rolling on
Is like a circus ride that don't last long
Round and round we go and then we're gone
We waste time chasing ghosts
And overlook the things that matter most
We get so caught up in the maybes
Just trying to be somebody baby
While we're slowly going crazy

Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated

We amputate the heart
'Cause we can't let 'em see the broken part
Water down, unwind, and jump the shark
We build our castles tall
Just so we can have the higher walls
But it no matter where you came from
Or where it is you get your name from
We're going down if we don't change some

Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated

We're all running after something
But if it ain't love it's nothing

It don't matter where you came from
Or where it is you get your name from
We're going down if we don't change some
I'm talking 'bout a ball of flames, son

Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated yeah

Overrated, overrated, overrated
Old Hank was a drifter passing through
He stayed long enough to cry the blues
Acquainted with the bottle
He knew the good Lord too
Hank was drifter passing through
Lefty was an oil rigger's son
He felt every word he ever sung
And when it came to singin', Lord
He showed them how it's done
Old Lefty was an oil rigger's son
They broke the ground
On the road that we go down today
Like a train whistle passing
Their voices are starting to fade
There are some who sing their praises
Others tip their hats
But it seems like we owe 'em more than that
Marty painted pictures with a song
El Paso made the whole world sing along
With the story of Felina and the cowboy in her arms
Marty painted pictures with a song
Waylon was the outlaw of our time
Not afraid to lay it on the line
He went against the grain
And he always spoke his mind
Waylon was the outlaw of our time
They broke the ground
On the road that we go down today
Like a train whistle passing
Their voices are starting to fade 
There are some who sing their praises
Others tip their hats
But it seems like we owe 'em more than that
There are some who sing their praises
Others tip their hats
But it seems like we owe 'em more than that
But it seems like we owe 'em more than that
We all know we owe 'em more than that...
Yeah, we do
All our tears have reached the sea
Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
New wind is gonna find your sail
That's where your journey starts

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please  remember me

Just like the waves down by the shore
We're gonna keep on comin' back for more
'Cause we don't ever want to stop
Out in this brave new world you'll see
Ov'r the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please  remember me

Remember me when you're out walking
When snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor
And I can't hurt you anymore

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please  remember me

Please remember me
I don't want to be talking on the phone every night
Six PM, which timezone, yours or mine?
Ain't gonna worry where you are, who you're with
Let's just agree, this is it

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, I don't want these things
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
And I don't want to know, I don't want to know

See I'm just saving us some trouble somewhere down the line
This kind of town you just leave behind
And you don't know it yet, but you won't come back
And I ain't going nowhere and you know that

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, I don't want these things
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

And you can go ahead and hate me, that's just fine
It doesn't matter either way, I'm right

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, I don't want these things
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know

Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is
There's nothing here to catch me now
I'm gonna fall anyway
It's just that kinda day
You might not know me good, but you know me good enough
To make me okay, okay
[Chorus:]
Just close your eyes and put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Take this weight off me
And put your lovin' on me
There's a chance that you might see something rolling off my cheek
But don't stop; it's not you
Make me forget, be my drug, get me high on your touch
For the night, all right
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Take this weight off me
And put your lovin' on me
There's nothing here to catch me now
I'm gonna fall anyway
Girl, you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am

I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My mama and my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am

I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

Might have a reckless streak
At least a country mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to lovin' you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

I'll take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
Except to do the best I can
I'll be damned

I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man
I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just about as wild as we were green
In the ways of the world
She'd pick me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night
Running all the red lights
We'd park way out in a clearing in a grove
And the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be
For two weeks
I was out of job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have the child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make believe in the end
And no I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might have been
That's a waste of time
Drive you out of your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped loving me
Last Monday mornin' you left with no warnin'
I started goin' insane
Well I headed South out of Del Rio, Texas
With a hell of a load on my brain I kept on goin' without even knowin'
How much your love really means
Now I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

This picture ain't pretty I'm ragged and dirty
And wonderin' what I'm doin' here
Shootin' tequila wantin' to kill ya
And wishin' to God you were near
So full of your memory but feelin' so empty
I've run out of my self-esteem
Now I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams
Oh I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams
Baby, I go too fast too far
Let's get it straight now
The way things are
I'm not the white knight in your fantasy
But I could be your wildest dream
[Chorus]
I might ride with the wind
I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade
I'm a renegade 
I get this feelin' that I should be gone
Somethin' keeps tellin' me to take you along
I got a Chevy with a big back seat
Climb on in
And take a chance on me 
[Chorus]
Don't even think about settlin' down
I ain't gonna hang my hat in no hometown 
[Chorus]
I'm a renegade
I'm a renegade
That night in Phoenix when you stole my jeep
Then you brought it home with a new stereo, baby, that was sweet
Oh and how can I forget the day you gave me my red guitar
The best gift by far, was you babe I'm sendin' all that love that you gave
Right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe just like a boomerang
Everything good you threw my way
Right back atcha babe
Best that you get ready
There's a whole lotta lovin' that's gonna be comin'
Right back atcha babe
First things first, I want you to close your eyes
This may not even come close to that first kiss you gave me
But I'm gonna try
Oh and here's that ring you've been waitin' for all these years
As for the tears, that you've cried
When we made love the first time
Yeah I see ya cry
Right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe just like a boomerang
Everything good you threw my way
Right back atcha babe
Best that you get ready
There's a whole lotta lovin' that's gonna be comin'
Right back atcha babe
Well if what comes around goes around,
You've got it made
Yeah you've got it made
Right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe just like a boomerang
Everything good you threw my way
Right back atcha babe
Best that you get ready
There's a whole lotta lovin' that's gonna be comin'
Right back atcha babe
Yeah, right back atcha babe
Right back atcha babe, yeah

Watching the waves roll
Love song in my soul

Sail on down the line 'bout-a half-a mile or so,
And-a don't really wanna know-a where you're goin'
Maybe once or twice, you see, time after time
I tried-a to, to hold on to what we got, but-a now you're goin'

And I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, Lord,
I gave all my money, and my time
I know it's a shame, but I'm givin' you back your name, yeah, yeah
Yes I'll be on my way, I won't be back to stay,
I guess I'll move along, I'm lookin' for a good time

Sail on down the line, funny how the time can go on-a
Friends say they told me so, but it doesn't matter.
It was plain to see that a small town boy like me
Just-a wasn't your cup of tea,
I was wishful thinkin'

I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy,
And you gave me nothin' in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say, "Would you please just go away," yeah, yeah
I've thrown away the blues, I'm tired of bein' used
I want everyone to know I'm lookin' for a good time, a good time

Sail on honey, good times never felt so good
Sail on honey, good times never felt so good
Sail on sugar, good times never felt so good

Sometimes this road, it just keeps winding 
Round and round and back again 
But you've always kept me smiling 
Over every hill, round every bend 
Baby you're the one smiling with me when the sun comes up 
I got the wheel, you got the map and that's enough 
And we go rolling down this highway 
Chasing all our crazy dreams 
I've gone your way and you've gone my way 
And everywhere in between 
One of these days we'll find a piece of ground 
Just outside of some sleepy little town 
And set this circus down 
Sometimes I lie awake just thinking 
Of all the horizons we have seen 
And as another day is sinking 
I thank God you're here with me 
'Cause baby you're the one laughing with me when the sun goes down 
Living on faith and holding on tight to the love we found 
And we go rolling down this highway 
Chasing all our crazy dreams 
I've gone your way and you've gone my way 
And everywhere in between 
One of these days we'll find a piece of ground 
Just outside of some sleepy little town 
And set this circus down 
And set this circus down 
Maybe one of these days, gonna set this circus down 
Set this circus down
Back seat of her daddy's car 
I was tryin' not to go too far 
Kept thinkin' 'bout the words the preacher man said 
Lightning flashed across the sky 
I saw love in a young girl's eyes 
And that's a look you never forget 
Seventeen

Rock and roll and faded blue jeans 
And standin' on the edge of everything

Legs hangin' off the bayou bridge 
Feedin' fish potato chips 
And talkin' 'bout the mysteries of the universe 
Yeah the world was somewhere else 
We had the summer all to ourselves 
And the stars went off like fireworks

Sweet seventeen
She left more than just her lipstick 
When she walked out 
Her memory keeps haunting me 
That's why I'm hunting you down 
It's been a long time since our lips met 
You've always been good at helping me forget 
I'll regret it in the morning but that's not stopping me now 
Senorita Margarita 
I'm as lonesome as a man can be 
I still love her I still need her 
I'm just hopin' you can comfort me 
I don't want to do her wrong 
I don't need somebody new 
I just can't be alone tonight 
So Senorita Margarita 
Let me hold you tight 
She always comes to her senses 
With some space and time 
And you're just what I needed 
To pull off this hot head of mine 
I hope you realize this is a one night stand 
I'm gonna get her back I know I can 
So let's keep this between you, me, the salt and the lime

Caught up in the whirlwind
I'm just a dragonfly yeah
And my wings ain't helping me yeah, hmm

I'm in a little trouble

Have no clue what I'm gonna do now hmm

And ask me who's put me in this twist
Ask me who's responsible for this

So now I'm in love
And I didn't want to be
And all because of she ohh wohh, ohh wohh
And all because of she ohh wohh, ohh wohh

Days ain't long enough
Nights are even shorter this ain't fair
Time don't wanna give me what I need
All I'm asking is forever

Forever little moment
Listen to me this ain't how I told

But I like it oohh

See me look at you and say

And all because of she ohh wohh ohh wohh
And all because of she ohh wohh ohh wohh
And all because of she
Everywhere I go
They're staring at her
Every man I know
He wants to have her
I guess I ought to be a jealous man
I'd look the other way
They're hittin' on her
Every night and day they telephone her
They try to get to her but I know they can't

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking
She starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart

She walks into the room
And everybody watches every move
Hoping she don't love me
I know it by the way they hang around
But they don't realize
There's more to her than what meets the eye
That's why I'm certain
No matter what they do to reach her now

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking
She starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart

When they start talking
She starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go (never lets it go)
To her heart
Once upon a lonely time
She swore she'd never let you down
You held her tight without a care in mind
While she did her runnin' 'round
At first you wouldn't face the truth
You loved her too much to let go
And though the story had to end
You want to be her fool again
Friend there's somethin' you should know

She'll have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time
Back to walkin' on your knees
Boy open up your eyes and see the light
Some things just aren't meant to be
I understand how she can get to you
'Cause she's made more than one man blind
So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time

It just don't make no sense to me
To play a game you'll never win
You ask me here for my advice
You say she wouldn't break you twice
Friend you better think again

She'll have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time
Back to walkin' on your knees
Boy open up your eyes and see the light
Some things just aren't meant to be
I understand how she can get to you
'Cause she's made more than one man blind
So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time

So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin' in no time
She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling down all night
She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar Says baby why you trembling like you are

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's the sunset's shadow
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreamin' tree
Together in this brief eternity

Summer days
Winter snow
She's all things to behold

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Ohhhhh rain on me
She's my kind of rain
You're probably sippin' lemonade and reading Hemingway
Underneath that tree out back in that same house
Where all that love was made
I'm sinkin' down on some corduroy couch
Empty bottles all around, quarter after two
And I'm still tryin' to start my day

Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time
'Cause all I wanna tell you is you were right
And I miss you and I'm sick of me too

My wandering eye, my little white lies
All the hell I've raised
All the times I made you cry like rain
Tired of lookin' at myself, wishin' I was someone else
Tired of nothin' to lose, tired of nothin' left
I've been thinkin' lately, maybe it's time to change

Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time
'Cause all I wanna tell you is you were right
I miss you and I'm sick of me too

I wanna be your everything, not just a bad memory
I'd rather be your sweet dream come true
I'm sick of me too

Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time
'Cause all I wanna tell you is you were right

Maybe I should call you up right out of the blue
Maybe you'll pick up and maybe I'll get through this time
'Cause all I wanna tell you is you were right
And I miss you and I'm sick of me too

I'm sick of me too
Yeah I'm sick of me
And I'm sick of me too
I fell by the wayside
I fell on my knees
Cryin' "why was I so hard to please"
I stood at the crossroads
Took a long look at me
Sometimes you don't know where
You're from 'til you leave
[Chorus]
And I've been out there searching
For a place where I belong
And on my way I heard my song
Let it sing me home
The sun on my shoulders
And the wind at my back
I'm bound and determined
To get back on track
To where the heart is
Where it's been all along
Sometimes you don't know what you've
Got 'til it's gone
Gone, gone, gone
[Chorus:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (3x)
[Chorus]
Hey darkness don't you try
To steal the moment or close my eyes
I won't let you in
'Cause this feels too damn good to me
All I want and all I need
Is her touch again and again and again
[Chorus]
I don't want to go to sleep tonight
I don't want anything to change
I don't want to wake up and find a different day
Yeah, she makes me free
Here between the day and the twilight
I don't want to go to sleep tonight
Time stop dead in your tracks
Turn around and don't look back
And just let us be
I'm gonna take this time and soak it up
Forever wouldn't be long enough
If you knew her you'd agree, agree with me
[Chorus]
I wish the sun would just forget to come up
And just leave us wrapped up in this love
[Chorus]
When God calls me home
And my soul is laid to rest
That won't mean I'm gone
Darling, heaven knows
I'll love you just the same
So, don't you feel alone
You may cry a tear or two and that's okay
Just know I'll never be too far away
I'll be sleeping in the stars
Shining through the dark
Watching, smiling, singing out into silence
Everywhere you are I'll be sleeping in the stars
Some steps that we take
Leave an everlasting mark
Even death can't take away
So, if you're missing me
Just look inside your heart
And let the memories play
You may cry a tear or two and that's okay
Look up and know I'm not that far away
I'll be sleeping in the stars
Shining through the dark
Watching, smiling, singing out in the silence
Everywhere you are I'll be sleeping in the stars
I'll be sleeping in the stars
Shining through the dark
Watching, smiling, singing out into silence
Everywhere you are I'll be sleeping in the stars
Everywhere you are I'll be sleeping in the stars

She left Oklahoma for California 
Sunglasses on the brim of her hat 
Smoke was pourin' from that old Cadillac 
But she wasn't turnin' back 
Just outside of Blackstaff 
Motor blew on her Coupe Deville 
Just in time she saw a sign 
There was a Texaco waitin' at the bottom of the hill 
And she said "somebody must be prayin' for me 
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me 
Must be angels I can't see 
Somebody must be prayin' for me" yeah 
A boy 'bout twenty climbed out of a truck 
All covered in grease and dirt 
She said "Hey Charles" but he just laughed 
And said "I'm wearin' my daddy's shirt" 
He stood there lost in her eyes 
And she got lost in his 
As the years roll by she would sigh 
Every time they kiss 
And she'd say "somebody must be prayin' for me 
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me 
Must be angels I can't see 
Somebody must be prayin' for me" 
Sometimes she stares out the window 
And wonders about her Hollywood dreams 
But when she tucks her kids in bed 
She softly whispers as they fall asleep 
Somebody must be prayin' for me 
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me 
Ain't it funny how you always find 
Just what you need 
Somebody must be prayin' for me 
Somebody must be prayin' for me 
Prayin' for me yeah
It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the County Fair
And when I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset
And that's a day I'll never forget

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that mini-skirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don't forget something like that

It was five years later on a south-bound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
When I looked I couldn't believe just what I saw

She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
You were killing me in that mini-skirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks

You had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don't forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of the first love
Never fades away

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that mini-skirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks

She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget
I said a heart don't forget something like that
Oh, not something like that
Now I ain't sayin' them LA ladies don't know what they're doin'
And I been in love with New York City a time or two
I had some Seattle coffee, some Chicago wind
Some Kansas wheat fields I'd love to see again
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow
And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans
Don't you know,
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

(Southern girl rock my world)
(Hazel eyes and golden curls)
(Put on a country song)
(Will dance all night long)

A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her thighs in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes jiggers in her coke, takes a little sip,
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans
Don't you know,
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

(Southern girl rock my world)
(Hazel eyes and golden curls)
(Put on a country song)
(Will dance all night long)

If you've ever seen savannah heat up when the stars come out
Well then fellows come on, you know what I'm talkin' about

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans
Don't you know,
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

(Southern girl rock my world)
(Put on a country song)

She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklin's, she wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money, it's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there when she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman, that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with the lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama, respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman and that's how you speak to a girl
She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just wanna feel that you're real, that she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne, that she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman, that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with a lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world

There's a place I like to go
Where I can here the cotton grow
When that train whistle blows
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still
There's the place I love to be
Momma daddy my sister & me
First time I ever saw the beach back to 1983
All I really have to do is just be still
When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes no matter where I am
And just be still
There's a place that I can see
Where my baby's next to me
Close enough to feel the heat
All wound up beneath the sheets
All I have to do is just be still
When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes
No matter where I am
And just be still
There's a place I need to go
Where the stain glass windows flow
Every part of me is known
Thank god I can go there
Thank god I can go there still
Thank god I can go there still
Are you still there?
I've got a bad connection
It's pouring rain, 2 a.m.
And I'm in the middle of nowhere

I don't know what to say (I'm saying it)
I don't know what to do (I'm doin' it)
All I really know is I know I need you, I need you yeah

I just called to hear you breathing
Your last words before you're sleeping
I can't sleep without your body next to mine
Yeah, I know I'm always leaving
Breaking your heart, breaking even
I'm just a number in the middle of the night but
I'm still on the line
I'm still on the line
I'm still on the line

Am I lonely?
Yeah, of course I am
Smoke green nights and red tail lights
Got me slowly going crazy

I don't know what to say (I'm saying it)
I don't know what to do (I'm doin' it)
All I really know is I know I need you, I need you

I just called to hear you breathing
Your last words before your sleeping
I can't sleep without your body next to mine
Yeah, I know I'm always leaving

I'm still on the line
I'm so glad that I met you, baby
I'm so proud when we walk in the room
I know it's crazy to worry like I do
I get this feelin' that I'm losing you

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
(Ooo, suspicions)
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
And I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it, but it gets me sometimes

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
(Ooo, suspicions)
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

Oh baby, oh darlin'

When I'm with you, I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
That look in your eyes when we make love
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinkin' of

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way

(Ooo, suspicions)
(Ooo, suspicions)
My Body burns
Like there's a desert deep in me
A thirsty soul so unsatisfied
But there you are like a river to the sea
The one chance I have to change my life
Darlin', take my away from here
Make it seem like we're a million miles away
Another time another place
Make me a different man
Move me farther than I've ever been before
Show me that there's something more
Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped inside myself
Spinning wheels up and down, 'round and 'round
Going no where just like everybody else
With no touch, no sight, no sound
But you could take me away from here
Make it seem like we're a million miles away
Another time another place
Make me a different man
Move me farther than I've ever been before
Show me that there's something more
Give me hopes and dreams to fill my head
Push my heart so I can fly again
Take me away from here
Make it seem like we're a million miles away
Another time another place
Make me a different man
Move me farther than I've ever been before
Show me that there's something more
Take me away from here
Take me away from here
Take me away from here
Take me away from here
Take me away from here
It was rainin' hard in Houston when I ran into her
I searched for conversation but I was lost for words
Then a cloud of tear filled memories came crashin' down on me
If it hadn't been for the pourin' rain I'm sure she would have seen
Tears in the rain
Hidin' the pain
Maybe she'd come back
If she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong
Oh, but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
Now, I'll regret that moment 'cause I didn't let her know
How much I still loved her I was hopin' it would show
But the raindrops and the teardrops ran together on my face
Now she'll never, ever know no one can take her place
Tears in the rain
Hidin' the pain
Maybe she'd come back
If she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong
Oh, but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
She thinks I'm so strong
Oh, but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
You hit me up in the beat up 'cause that's just south of tale, you right
You lit one up and never said a word till we got mountain high
You said he was bound for Texas to a dusty old ghost town
I said "well, honey, what a hell? let's chase the sunset down"
And we rode on
Moved along
It don't matter as long as we're together
It all feels like home 
No, it don't matter as long as we're together
It all feels like home
She took off her blue bandana and let her blonde hair down
She sang me a song she wrote, lord what a beautiful sound
We stopped over in Amarillo and slept underneath the stars
I gave her my last cigarette and then she stole my heart
Yeah, we rode on
Moved along
It don't matter as long as we're together
It all feels like home (it don't matter)
No, it don't matter as long as we're together
It all feels like home
Feels like home
Feels like home
Just a vagabond and a gypsy fool out here on the run
Playing songs for not much cash, but lord we sure had fun
We make good love and we make good friends wherever we've been
Just go back to tell you right and do it all over again
And we rode on
Moved along
It don't matter as long as we're together
It all feels like home (it don't matter)
No, it don't matter as long as we're together
It all feels like home
No, it don't matter as long as we're together
It all feels like home (it don't matter as long as we're together)
No, it don't matter as long as we're together
It all feels like home
Well I was southern born and raised on the Good Book
My old boots are worn from the hard roads I took
And I'm proud to be my daddy's son
And momma taught me how to work and not to quit
Until the job's done
Well I may not be high society but I got all I need
And that's just me
The only way I know to be
That's just me
What you get is what you see
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned
And that I'm part of a dying breed
I'd say I'm living in real good company
But that's just me
Well I got me a wife and we're bringing up a young one
Well she's a backwoods woman and my boy he's a top gun
We live out in the country where we're free to roam
And when a hard day is over how I love just going home
Well it's the life I live and the air I breathe
The way I believe
And that's just me
The only way I know to be
That's just me
What you get is what you see
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned
And that I'm part of a dying breed
I'd say I'm living in real good company
But that's just me
Yeah they tell me I'm old fashioned
And that I'm part of a dying breed
I'd say I'm living in real good company
But that's just me
The dishes are clean in the kitchen
There ain't no dirt on the floor
The laundry is all done washing
There ain't no honey do this no more
The sugar bowl is all full of sugar
The car has been washed and waxed
The roses have all been watered
It's damn hear perfect on the cul-de-sac so
Let's go make a mess of the bed we made this morning
Like the roofs been hit by hurricane
Throw those pillows on the hardwood
And tangle those sheets up real good
Let's go make a mess of, make a mess of the bed we made
I'm talking candle wax on teh dresser
Half spilled empty bottle of wine
A trail of clothes down the hallway
Pick it up tomorrow but baby tonight
Let's go make a mess of the bed we made this morning
Like the roofs been hit by hurricane
Throw those pillows on the hardwood
And tangle those sheets up real good
Let's go make a mess of, make a mess of the bed we made
So you go and pull back the covers
I'll go and pull down the shades
Let's go make a mess of the bed we made this morning

I don't know why I act the way I do 
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose 
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy 
I guess that's just the cowboy in me 
I got a life that most would love to have 
But sometimes I still wake up fightin' mad 
At where this road I'm heading down might lead 
I guess that's just the cowboy in me 
The urge to run, the restlessness 
The heart of stone I sometimes get 
The things I've done for foolish pride 
The me that's never satisfied 
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see 
I guess that's just the cowboy in me 
The urge to run, the restlessness 
The heart of stone I sometimes get 
The things I've done for foolish pride 
The me that's never satisfied 
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see 
I guess that's just the cowboy in me 
Girl I know there's times you must have thought 
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed 
But you set your mind to see this love on through 
I guess that's just the cowboy in you 
We ride and never worry about the fall 
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all
She was reading a book that she'd already read
Just to pass the time
He just sat there and stared at the TV set
Like he was barely alive
And when the local news was over
They would climb the stairs
And crawl in bed underneath the covers
Like neither one was there
It's a long, long way
Across the great divide
The songs that they once sang
Now echo far and wide
They could still get back
All the love that they have lost
(But) only if they both will reach across
('Cause) it's a long, long way to the other side
Of the great divide
He was up in the attic on the fourth of July
'Cause they flew a flag in the yard
When he found some old roses she had long ago dried
Before they drifted apart
And how the years had slipped right by them
He didn't understand
He carried a petal into the kitchen
And he placed it in her hand
It's a long, long way
Across the great divide
The songs that they once sang
Now echo far and wide
They could still get back
All the love that they have lost
(But) only if they both will reach across
('Cause) it's a long, long way to the other side
Of the great divide
Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?
There's one thing I should be killing off and giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives
I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son it'd be Ryan
There's one thing I should be killing off and giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives
I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old
Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life
If I never think about her I'll never miss her at all 
Never wonder what she's doing never give her a call 
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird 
But the trouble with never is never never works 
If I never bring her flowers I'll never see her smile 
If I never try to kiss her she'll never drive me wild 
And I'll never feel the need to say those three little words 
But the trouble with never is never never works 
I know how to stay care free 
Let no one get a hold on me 
But I can't keep my hands off her 
There's somethin' different 'bout this girl 
If I never let me love her I'll never settle down 
And I'll never put roots in this God forsaken town 
And I'll never say "I do" or step foot in a church 
But the trouble with never is never never works 
I know how to stay care free 
Let no one put a hold on me 
But I can't keep my hands off her 
There's somethin' different 'bout this girl 
If I never think about her I'll never miss her at all 
Never wonder what she's doing never give her a call 
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird 
But the trouble with never is never never works 
Yeah the trouble with never is never never works 
At least not with her, oh no
All the girls want to love the way I drink my drink
The way I sing, the way I sing
All the boys gonna love the way you wear your jeans
You do that thing, you do that thing

Hitting me like a laser beam
Our energy is a wild thing
I can't believe it's you and me

All of them gonna hate it when we up and leave
They don't see what we don't see what we say
You're all I see and all you see is me

So stay tonight, we've got the view, ooh
Up so high, we've got the view, ooh
Stay tonight, hey

Let 'em stare, let 'em talk
Let 'em say anything they want

They wouldn't let him play the Opry 
With whiskey on his breath
And it didn't take 'em long 
To figure out what they missed 
He went down that lost highway
Underneath the purple sky 
A legend disappeared before his time 
Things change 
They said he was the devil
Dressed in gold lame
The way he shook his hips 
Out there on that stage 
But before that faithful day 
He left Tennessee 
All of them were calling him the king
Things change 
Well they like to call them hippies
Outlaws with guitars
But they brought a little poetry 
To the honky tonks and bars 
They might've got a little crazy 
They might have flew a little too high
Somewhere somebody's playing their song tonight
Things change 
(Don't you know things change)
Now some say it's too country 
Some say it's a little rock n roll
But it's just good music 
If you can feel it in your soul 
It doesn't really matter 
It's always been the same 
Life goes on 
Things change
Don't you know they change
Oh, things change
As long as this world is turning
Things are gonna change
Gonna keep on changing
Gonna change
The clock above the bar
Is telling me it's 12:15
It's not such a gentle reminder 
That I'm where I shouldn't be
I just keep waiting for something to happen
Waitin' for somebody to come walkin' in
Somebody as perfect as you were
So I can try it again
(But) chances are so hard to come by
And the second one is impossible to find
The clock keeps runnin' and the odds keep getting higher
That it's all just a fantasy of mine
But I shouldn't be thinkin' about it
I shouldn't be worried about it
It's just a clock on the wall 
But it's tickin' away
It's tickin' away
It's tickin' away
It's tickin' away
I suppose I should cut all my losses
Go home with a six-pack of beer
There ain't nobody in the world like you, baby
If there was she wouldn't be coming in here
But I shouldn't be thinkin' about it
I shouldn't be worried about it
It's just a clock on the wall
But it's tickin' away
It's tickin' away
It's just a clock on the wall but
It's tickin' away
It's tickin' away
It's tickin' away
It's just a clock on the wall but
It's tickin' away
I suppose I should cut all my losses
Go home with a six-pack of beer
Sister cries out from her baby bed
Brother runs in feathers on his head
Momma's in her room learning how to sew
Daddy's drinking beer, listening to the radio
Hank Williams sings "Kaw Liga" and "Dear John"
And time marches on, time marches on
Sister's using rouge and clear complexion soap
Brother's wearing beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Momma is depressed, barely makes a sound
Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town
Bob Dylan sings "Like a Rolling Stone"
And time marches on, time marches on
The south moves north, the north moves south
A star is born, a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same is
Everything changes, everything changes
Sister calls herself a "Sexy Grandma"
Brother's on a diet for high cholesterol
Momma's out of touch with reality
Daddy's in the ground beneath a maple tree
As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on
I had tinted windows on my first car,
We used to park out by the reservoir.
We had the water, radio and the stars,
Never had to worry our friends would come knocking on those

Tinted windows covered in steam,
Floorboard piled up with t-shirts and jeans.
You didn't know what you were doing to me,
But I was so gone baby, I was so gone for you.

Oh, it doesn't seem like it could really be,
So long ago when we were seventeen,
So long ago it feels just like a dream when it was you and me and

Tinted windows and six-pack of light,
I know I didn't pop the question right,
But that diamond looked good in the dashboard light
And you said, "Yes, you know the answer is Yes"

Oh, it doesn't seem like it could really be,
So long ago when we were seventeen,
So long ago it feels just like a dream when it was you and me and
Tinted windows

We sold that car back in '97
Should have got fifteen, but we only got eleven
We grew up and we grew apart
The years rolled by and now your eyes are

Tinted windows and I wanna believe
Somewhere inside you're still in love with me
I keep looking, hoping to see it through those
Tinted windows, all those tinted windows

Tinted windows, those tinted windows
Tinted windows
Tinted windows
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
She was the seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
She'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen
Her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me
Always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Oh oh oh oh
It ain't rained in a month
Mama done took a job part time at the five and dime
Lord, times is hard, Daddy's pride is really hurtin', feelin' less than a man
Workin' dark to dark, how much more can he stand?
I ain't never seen him cry now I'm seventeen
Quarterback, first train, gave my high school ring
To the prettiest little girl, green eyes and red hair.
I think I might ask her to marry me tonight at the fair.
I ain't never been so torn, should I stay or leave?
Get out of this small town, am I lettin' 'em down?
I could even play ball somewhere in the fall
Live the big city life, I guess I could have it all
Lord, I'm twisted, I feel the stress that's hangin' on me,
And all this pain in my family they all depend on me.
Lord, I'm twisted, I feel the stress that's hangin' on me,
And all this pain in my family they all depend on me.
Lord, I'm twisted.
Man, how do you decide between real life and a dream?
Lovin' ya Ma and Pa, ya girl, and ya team
Trying to figure out the next move to make,
Trying to figure out the right road to take.
Dying to get out, but still afraid to roam.
Is it wrong to wanna leave the only place I've known?
Life as I know it is just simple and plain:
Chores, school, and practice, everyday is the same.
I'm tired of the routine and everyone knowing me.
I'm dreaming of everything the t.v. is showing me.
They promised me a full ride to UCLA,
But that's a whole 'nother world for small town G.A.
Lord, I'm askin', I hope you hear my prayer
'Cause I'm torn between here and what I see over there
I pray someway that you could give me a sign
Tell me which way to go 'cause I sure don't know
Lord, I'm twisted, I feel the stress that's hangin' on me,
And all this pain in my family they all depend on me.
Lord, I'm twisted, I feel the stress that's hangin' on me,
And all this pain in my family they all depend on me.
Lord, I'm twisted.
Lord, we're one win away from winning it all,
And I'm a plane flight away from seeing my first ball
I can finally see the ocean and stars of Hollywood
Say bye to this damn farm, get a tattoo on my arm
Forget these dirt roads and the way I was raised
Chase the bright lights of the California nights
Sports cars and sushi is all I see
When I order some sweet tea they start laughin' at me
Boy, this new life ain't what I thought it would be
Maybe the city life ain't made for me
Now I'm wishing I was fishin' on the lake with Dad,
And starting to realize being country ain't bad
I miss that ol' farm and that red headed girl
Waking up before the sun to help Daddy get it done.
I'm packed and headed back to the place I was born
Proud to be country and no longer torn
Lord, I'm twisted, I feel the stress that's hangin' on me,
And all this pain in my family they all depend on me.
Lord, I'm twisted, I feel the stress that's hangin' on me,
And all this pain in my family they all depend on me.
Lord, I'm twisted. yeah yeah
Lord, I'm twisted
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
If I should wait or should I go, I just don't know
This song is for everybody, no matter whether you're from a small town,
The hood, the big city, it don't matter everybody's got their dreams they wanna follow
Some people are ashamed of where they're from, they don't know where they're supposed to be
Everybody find your place in life, be proud of who you are
Don't let nothing hold you back
Just bring me home
I'm twisted, so twisted
I'm so twisted
Two hearts, two bucket seats, too much sun not to wear shades.
Boot to the pedal and pedal to the metal, we're the reason this road was paved yeah.
Now honey, how fast you wanna go, NASCAR driving Miss Daisy.
Radio loud, radio low, or I can sing if you want me to baby.
I can tell God's smiling down, I just get that feeling,
You and me going town to town, on two lanes of freedom.

Oh, no red lights or stop signs around for miles,
Just swaying trees, your hair in the breeze, and that smile, and I know
God made old country roads for driving and dreaming,
Mine's coming true girl here with you on two lanes of freedom.
Two lanes of freedom.

Bottle of wine and a cheap motel, door 12 feet from the road
Watch the sunset holding hands and talk about where we're gonna go
So where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)
Where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)
Where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)
Where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)

Babe, there's no red lights or stop signs around for miles,
Just swaying trees, your hair in the breeze, and that smile, and I know
God's working down from that sky blue ceiling,
He made these old country roads for driving and dreaming,
Mine's coming true girl here with you on two lanes of freedom.
Two lanes of freedom.
Two lanes of freedom.
Two lanes of freedom.

Two lanes of freedom.
Two lanes of freedom.
Two lanes of freedom.
Two lanes of freedom.
Two lanes of freedom.
Swingin' doors
Neon lights
Hardwood floors
It's Saturday night
Got on my dancing boots
I've got a cold Lonestar
I've got a two steppin' mind
And a honky tonk heart
I've got a two steppin' mind And a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
It's happy hour when I get there
Pretty girls, man they're everywhere
There ain't no way to keep us apart
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
Hey, I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces
Of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place, every pain got erased
You held me up to the sunlight, now it feels like

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see you smile feel my soul again
And I'm unbroken

If I doubted the power of love, baby now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch
Of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real is the way you make me feel
Babe, the changes day and night
I swear it's life

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see you smile feel my soul again
I'm unbroken

I still see the night, I fell into your eyes
And when we made love it felt like the first time

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see you smile feel my soul again
I'm unbroken

I'm unbroken, oh yeah
I'm unbroken

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
In the fights they had he'd cover up his ears
Thought big boys don't cry, fight back all the tears
Mamma'd use her makeup to hide the bruises on her face
In the morning they'd pretend that there'd never ever been a trace
His old man woke him up to help him find the car
Take the bus uptown outside some run down bar
He swore that he was quitting, and then he'd start to cry
And though the boy knew the truth, sometimes he'd still believe that lie
The sins of the father are the sins of the son
All you do is crawl when you want to run
God gave boys their mammas 
'Cause they always see their promise 
And they help them understand
How to walk like man
Walk like a man
They moved a lot of places, they never settled down
And it got pretty old being the new kid in town
He'd always tell his friends, "My daddy's sick today"
Said he's be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his momma say:
The sins of the father are the sins of the son
Crawl before you walk boy, walk before you run
Come on stand up straight, I'm proud of you, take my hand
I know you can
Walk like a man
Walk like a man
Your daddy's demons are callin' your name
Don't you listen to you 'em cause they got no claim
Temptations may come that ain't no sin
You get stronger every time that you don't give in
The sins of the father are the sins of son
You can't undo what has been done
You'll have to retrace his footsteps through the sand
And pray you find the love of a girl
Take her by the hand and walk on 
Walk like a man
The creek goes ripplin' by
I been barefootin' all day with my baby
Brown leaves have started fallin'
Leadin' the way
I like it best just like this
Doin' nothin' all the way
So let's lay down in the tall grass
Dreamin' away

And all I want to do is let it be
And be with you and watch the wind blow by
And all I want to see is you and me
Go on forever like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only you and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by

Girl, you know you told me not so long ago
To let it come, then let it pass
And all your troubles and your sorrows
They won't last
So let me kiss you now little darlin'
Beneath this autumn moon
Cold winds, another season
Will be here soon

And all I want to do is let it be
And be with you and watch the wind blow by
And all I want to see is you and me
Go on forever like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only you and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by

All I want to do is watch the wind blow by
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
He hasn't seen a drop of rain for months it seems
The rollin' river is nothing; but a tricklin' stream
The crops are dyin' in the harsh sunlight
The dust on his tongue is dry
The fatted calf is down to skin and bones
We carry on
Alone in the city and she's only seventeen
The boy left her black and blue on the
Streets so mean
Just twelve weeks along and she's got
A life inside
Said she never ever felt so alone
She walks in the shelter, they say
Welcome home
We carry on
When our lives come undone
We carry on
'Cause there's promise in the morning sun
We carry on
As the dark surrenders to the dawn
We were born to overcome
We carry on
Beyond the picket fences and the oil wells
The happy endings and the fairy tales
Is the reality of shattered lives and
Broken dreams
We carry on
Its the family that grieves for a lost
Loved one
Its the soldier that won't leave til the
Job is done
Its the addict trying to turn his life around
Its pickin' yourself up off the ground
When you've been knocked down
We carry on
When our lives come undone
We carry on
'Cause there's promise in the morning sun
We carry on
As the dark surrenders to the dawn
We were born to overcome
We carry on
When our lives come undone
We carry on
'Cause there's promise in the morning sun
We carry on
As the dark surrenders to the dawn
We were born to overcome
We carry on
Carry on
We carry on
He stands in the field, cooled by
The winds of change
She smiles as her baby moves and it starts to rain
I couldn't help but overhear you talkin' to yourself
How she slipped right through your hands
And in between all of the four letter words
You said you're never gonna understand
You gave her everything you thought she wanted
Now all you want is gone
You're just one of many broken hearted
Wonderin' what went wrong 
Welcome to the club
Don't be thinkin' you're the only one
Whose heart was in a hit and run
While you looked the other way
As you're howlin' at the moon
Take a look around the room
At all your fellow fools of love
Welcome to the club 
Over in the corner is old Larry John
Gettin' over wife number two
And sittin' next to him is a regular here
They're as lonely as me and you
We got one thing in common when we walked in
A memory we're tryin' to kill
Swearin' up and down we'll never try again but we know we will 
Welcome to the club
Don't be thinkin' you're the only one
Whose heart was in a hit and run
While you looked the other way
As you're howlin' at the moon
Take a look around the room
At all your fellow fools of love
Welcome to the club 
Welcome to the club
Welcome to the club
Welcome to the club
Welcome to the club
You've got a glow that's not a suntan
And a new gleam in your eyes
Oh, it must have been one great vacation
Girl, you look so satisfied
Tell me what room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in
You said you needed a small vacation
Just a couple of days all by yourself
So, off you went in a new direction
And what you found was someone else
So, tell me what room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in
What room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in 
Tell me what room was the holiday
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in
She took the TV and the toaster
She took the curtains and the car
I guess she took for granted
I wouldn't take it very hard
And for someone in a hurry
She took her own sweet time
But it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us that she said "throw away"
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No, it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
She said I've given you my best but I can't take no more
She said I've run out of reasons then she walked out the door
It's gonna take a lot of doin' to get over her goodbye
'Cause it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind 
A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us that she said "throw away"
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No, it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
With a trembling pen in hand I try the best I can
To write all the reasons I can't stay
And I hope she'll understand I can't leave her like a man
'Cause a man would never leave her this way
A note of things I should've said
Lays beside her sleeping head
As I turn and make my way off in the night
By the time the morning's breaking
My heart will still be aching
Every time I think of what I've left behind
'Cause I don't want to see me leaving in her eyes
And I can't stand to watch her watch me make her cry
And I don't know a right way I can do her wrong
So I don't want to be here in the morning
When she wakes up and finds me gone
It hurts to know how much she'll hurt I've told myself things could be worse
And I've convinced myself she's better off this way
By the time she finds I'm gone
I'll be a long, long way from home
When she reads a note of things I couldn't say
'Cause I don't want to see me leaving in her eyes
And I can't stand to watch her watch me make her cry
And I don't know a right way I can do her wrong
So I don't want to be here in the morning
When she wakes up and finds me gone
Lord I don't want to be here in the morning
When she wakes up and finds me gone
Dancin' when the stars go blue
Dancin' when the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

Dancin' out on 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' with the marionette
Are you happy now?

Where do you go when you're lonely?
Where do you go when you're blue?
Where do you go when you're lonely?
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

Laughin' with your pretty mouth
Laughin' with your broken eyes
Laughin' with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

Where do you go when you're lonely?
Where do you go when you're blue?
Where do you go when you're lonely?
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Six lanes tail lights
Red ants marchin' into the night
They disappear to the left and right again
Another supper
From a sack
A ninety nine cent heart attack
I got a poundin' head and an achin' back
And the camels buried in a big straw stack

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close, to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Well I'm from
A map dot
A stop sign on a blacktop
I caught the first bus, I could hop from there
But all o' this glitter is gettin' dark
There's concrete glowin' in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
And there's bars on the corner and bars on my heart

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close, to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close, to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Whoa where the green grass grows
Come with me, and let's go wander
Far beyond the wild blue yonder,
Out where stars roam free.
Though the journey's far from breezy,
Stick with me, I'll make it easy-
You can depend on me.
Yeah, there's a long road before us,
And it's a hard road, indeed.
Bur darlin', I swear,
I'll get us there,
Wherever the trail may lead.
Once we cross that far horizon,
Life is bound to be surprisin'
But we'll take it day by day.
Never mind the wind and weather,
If we walk that trail together,
Somehow we'll find our way.
Yeah, there's a long road before us,
And it's a hard road, indeed.
Bur darlin', I vow,
We'll get through somehow,
Wherever the trail may lead.
Can't tell you when we'll be there-
It may take all our lives.
We're headin' for that great unknown.
We'll soon be walkin' free there,
But 'til that day arrives,
At least we won't be travellin' alone...
And there's a long road before us,
And it's a hard road, indeed.
Bur darlin', don't fear,
'Cause I'll be right here,
To give you the strength you need...
And through the whole ride,
I'll be by your side,
Wherever the trail may lead.
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty, so right now I don't feel a thing
I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
And I'll be over it by noon
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem
Yeah, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness is something I can't buy
Ain't a thing that I can do
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you
[Chorus:]
One's the devil, and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps hide me from my pain
And one's a long, hard, bitter truth
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you
I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink 'cause I'm lonesome, and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
If I don't break down and bring it on myself, it'll hit right out of the blue
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you
[Chorus]
Yeah, that's the difference between the whiskey and you
They say not to have too much fun
They say not to get too much sun
Democrat or Republican
Guess I'm screwed I'm neither one
Don't say hell say what the heck
Do what politically correct
Don't pray in school but have safe sex
Isn't that what they expect
[Chorus]
Who are they, yeah you know what they say
Who are they, someone I gotta pay
Who are they, they're probably livin' in L.A.
And I don't care anyway, who are they
They probably own the Village Voice
The Nashville Scene, the People's Choice
To me it's just a bunch of noise
Decided on by funny boys
They say who does and don't belong
They say our hair's too short or long
They say who's right and who's wrong
As if we'll all just come along
[Chorus]
Well I wonder if they've got a life
A broken car and two ex-wives
Do they drink beer on Friday night
I wonder if they like to fight
And I wonder if they've got a soul
Or if they like their rock-n-roll
Where do they live, I gotta know
So I can tell 'em where to go
[Chorus]
Well I don't care anyway
They're probably livin' out in L.A.
Who are they
Aw, you know what they say
Who are they, who are they, who are they
Who are they
I remember Sunday mornings walking on the beach
And that place we'd stop for breakfast with the old red vinyl seats
The hours of the tide chart
The way the sunlight dance upon your face

That antique roller coaster you just had to ride
I remember how you laughed at the terror in my eyes
The color and the detail
Just like it was yesterday

And I remember how you held me the night my father died
I didn't have to tell you
I just broke down and cried
You're sewn into the fabric, the pieces of my life
And I just can't remember why we said goodbye

Up and down this boardwalk lonely people sit
I know it wasn't perfect but nothin' ever is
The sails out in the harbor
Are searching for the wind

I just had to call you, I had to hear your voice
And tell you I still love you we still have a choice
You're sewn into the fabric, the pieces of my life
And I just can't remember why we said goodbye

Everything I do
Leads back to you
I know I just can't let us go

There must have been a reason, but I can't remember now
I know if I could hold you we could work it out
You're sewn into the fabric the pieces of my life
And girl let's give it one more try
'Cause I just can't remember why we said goodbye
Without me
Maybe you'd find somebody else
A little wiser
With a lot more wealth
And without you
It's true I'd be free
To go chasing all my dreams
Without any strings
But I wouldn't want it any other way
Having you to come home to at the end of every day
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Hard times
May never let up on us
And maybe all we'll ever have
Will barely be enough
And babe you know
How cold the wind can blow
Love's never let us down
When we needed it the most
And I wouldn't want it any other way
Having you to come home to at the end of every day
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Wouldn't want it any other way
Any other way
Oh girl
You know I love you more each day
Any other way
Well I'm gonna have to get a new mailbox
'Cause all she left me was a hole
And I'm gonna hafta get a new washin' machine
As soon as I get some new clothes
Well I could close my eyes and run through this house
And never once stub my big toe
It was a man who'd never been left who said
You can't take it with you when you go
Hell she took everything but the kitchen sink
If I had me a glass lord, I'd pour me a drink
It's a lesson hard learned but it just goes to show
You can take it with you when you go
Well I'm sittin' here on this hard floor
Where a big soft couch used to be
And I'm starin' at a bug on the wall
Where there used to be a T.V.
Well I'd kill that sucker in a heartbeat
If I could find me anything to throw
I was so naive to have ever believed
You can't take it with you when you go
Well she took everything but the kitchen sink
If I had me a glass lord I'd pour me a drink
It's a lesson hard learned but it just goes to show
You can take it with you when you go
Well she took everything but the kitchen sink
If I had me a glass lord I'd pour me a drink
It's a lesson hard learned but it just goes to show
You can take it with you when you go
I oughta call somebody but I ain't got a phone
Just goes to show you can take it with you when you go
She walks over to him and she says 
Do you remember me 
I think we might've met somewhere before 
Southern Carolina is the place that comes to mind 
But hey I guess you never really can be sure 
Oh there's nothing like a true love 
To go and make a fool of someone 
Just like before 
And right there for a minute 
I forgot that you don't love me anymore 
Then an old familiar feeling 
Wraps its arms around the moment 
And he says so many times I've tried to call 
Well you'd think it's been a lifetime 
It's been two years since I've seen you 
But it seems just like no time's gone by at all 
Oh there's nothing like a real love 
To give you back the feel of someone 
Just like before 
And right there for a minute 
I forgot that you don't love me anymore 
Oh and how far we'll travel 
For a place to heal our hearts 
We watched it unravel 
To why's tonight the hardest part 
Then he says the weather's changin' 
And it's icin' up the highway 
So I guess it's time for me to hit the road 
So she says good-bye and then before 
She knows what she is sayin' she says 
I wish you didn't have to go 
Oh there's nothing like a true love 
To go and make a fool of someone 
Just like before 
And right there for a minute 
I forgot that you don't love me anymore 
And right there for a minute 
I forgot that you don't love me anymore
I thought I felt you touch my cheek this mornin'
But I must'a been dreamin'
And in the middle of the night with out a warnin'
I thought I heard you breathin'
Me and my so-called independence
I've got this loneliness that's so relentless
[Chorus]
I guess you get used to somebody
Kind of like havin' them around
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
I never dreamed when I was letting you go
That I would wake up and miss you this much
I guess you get used to somebody
I guess you get used to bein' loved
I kinda miss those ramblin' conversations
Where we talked about nothin'
The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations
Baby, that was somethin'
I should've been careful what I wished for
Cause I've got my freedom and so much more
[Chorus]
I never dreamed when I was letting you go
That I would wake up and miss you this much
I guess you get used to somebody
I guess you get used to bein' loved
Baby, when I met you
There was peace unknown
I set out to get you
With a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me
That I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
'Cause we love one another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
'Cause we love one another, ah ha
I can't live without you
If the love was gone
Everything is nothing
If you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us
And we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
'Cause we love one another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
'Cause we love one another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between

There ought to be a town out there,
Named for how I feel.
Yeah I could be the mayor down there,
And say welcome to Sorryville.
It won't be on a map nowhere,
You might say that it doesn't exist,
But if you make enough wrong turns
It'd be hard to miss.

There ought to be a bridge somewhere
They could dedicate to me.
I'd probably come to the ceremony
With a can of gasoline
Walk on over to the other side
And there I'd light a match
And sit and stare through the smoke and the flames
Wonderin' how I'm ever gonna get back.

Why do I do the things I do?
Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?
I shoot the lights and curse the dark
I need your love but I break your heart
And I know the words that'll bring you back,
But I don't say nothin' as I watch you pack.
I had to work to be the jerk I've come to be
It ain't easy bein' me.

Ought to be a side show act for freaks like me
Yeah I could be the star of the show
With my name on the marquee.
In a room with a big red button that says "Do Not Touch,"
And twice a day I'd mash it down
And you could watch me self-destruct.

Why do I do the things I do?
Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?
I shoot the lights and curse the dark
I need your love but I break your heart
And I know the words that'll bring you back,
But I don't say nothin' as I watch you pack.
I had to work to be the jerk I've come to be
It ain't easy bein' me.
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell twist
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock.
Sun just dropped off the face of the Earth
World just washed off a hard day's work
Band's about to kick off the night and the first song
(One, two, three, four)
There's a seven-forty-seven cutting cross the sky
Granny and her slippers kissing pa goodnight
Gonna lock down the hatch til the first butt crack of dawn
And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
We the people of the midnight hour
Silver bullet proof full of whisky power
Getting louder and louder as the night rolls on
And getting drunk and stoned
We're the all night owls and the neon lighters
Liquored up lovers and bar room fighters
And we ain't slowing down
When the light weight crowd goes home
'Cause we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
Yeah, don't you hate it when the night runs out of time
And you still got some moon in a jug of shine
Birds are singing and bringing on daylight
And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
Oh, yeah, we're just getting started
I never liked the taste of whiskey til I kissed it off of her lips
Never knew just what was hitting me, getting me tipsy
But there I sit, Levi's on a dogwood branch
Yeah, she was taking me under
I might have lost my innocence
But she was saving my soul that summer

I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven and seven
Somewhere just south of heaven

She might have been a fallen angel
Nah, I didn't care at all
I never thought a prayer could be answered
With a whispered, sweet southern drawl
Even now when I close my eyes
I see her silhouette dance on the river
The way we spent those endless nights
That's the way I could spend forever

I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven and seven
Somewhere just south of heaven

Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church, roll back through the pines
Down where the Three Cross river unwinds
If there's a heaven on Earth, man that'd be mine

I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going

Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven and seven
Somewhere just south of heaven

Oh yeah, just south of heaven

Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church, roll back through the pines
Down where the Three Cross river unwinds
If there's a heaven on Earth, man that'd be mine

Yeah, that'd be mine
Oh, just a little bit south of heaven, mmm yeah
Another shot of whiskey please bartender
Keep it coming til I don't remember at all
How bad it hurts when you're gone (na na na)
Turn the music up a little bit louder
Just gotta get past the midnight hour
Maybe tomorrow it won't
Be this hard
Who am I kidding
I know what I'm missing
I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel
(Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who'd never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
(Yeah)
I said that I don't care
I'd walk away whatever
And I tell myself we were bad together (uh huh)
But that's just me trying to move on
With out you
But who am I kidding
I know what I'm missing
Hey, I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who know that love was so cruel
(Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who'd never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
For holding on to something that
Is never ever gonna come back
I can't accept that it's lost
I should have let it go
Held my tongue
Can't fight the motion
Cause now everything's so wrong
Wrong, wrong
I'm just a fool
A fool for you
I'm just a fool
Hey, I had my heart set on you
And nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel
(Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who'd never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool

It's my fault to think you'll be true
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
Tearin' down a dirt road, rebel flag flyin', coon dog in the back
Truck bed loaded down with beer and a cold one in my lap
Earnhart sticker behind my head and my woman by my side
Tail-pipe's poppin', the radio's rockin', "Country boy can survive"
If you got a problem with that, ha, ha, you can kiss my country ass
Well, I love turkey calls, overalls, Wrangler jeans
Smoke nothin' but Marlboro reds
Tattoos up and down my arms
And deer heads over my bed
My Granddaddy fought in World War II
But my Daddy went to Vietnam
And I ain't scared to grab my gun
And fight for my homeland
If you don't love the American flag
You can kiss my country ass
If you're a down-home, backwoods redneck
Hey come on, stand up and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass, aw yeah
Aw, yeah
Well, there's a whole lotta high-class people out there
That's lookin' down on me
'Cause the country club where I belong
Is a honky tonk till three in the mornin'
Don't wear no fancy clothes, no ties or three piece suits
You can find me in my camouflage cap
My T-shirt and cowboy boots
If that don't fit your social class
You can kiss my country ass
If you're a down-home, backwoods redneck
Hey come on, stand up and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass
Well, I'm a front-porch sittin', guitar pickin', moonshine sippin'
'Backer chew spittin' country boy from the woods
And I love fried chicken and blue gill fishin'
And outlaw women and I wouldn't change if I could, no
I ain't tryin' to start no fight but I'll finish one every time
So you just mind your own damn business, stay the hell outta mine
If you got a problem with that
You can kiss my country ass
I said, if you got a problem with any of that
You can kiss my natural born
Redneck to the bone
Ever lovin' country ass
That's right
Think I'll grab a bottle of Patron
When I get off work on my way home
Fill that hot tub full of bubble bath, kick back, relax
Baby you and me and nothing on yea

Got a weekend coming just in time
We're both needing what I've got in mind
What I got in mind, that's me and you into me and you
Can't wait to get you all alone yea

Lay low, stay home and stay high
Stay up, make love, all night
I wanna run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and lay low

We'll let our kisses do the talking girl
Take each other to another world
Feel like we're a million miles from here
Somewhere out there, without going anywhere at all

Lay low, stay home and stay high, yea
Stay up, make love, all night
I wanna run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and

Lay low, stay home and stay high, yea
Stay up, make love, all night
I wanna run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and lay low

Stay home, stay high and lay low
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
How I hate going out in this storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
How I hate going out in this storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Don't you feel it growing, day by day
People getting ready for the news
Some are happy, some are sad
Oh, we got to let the music play
What the people need
Is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message
Get it on through
Oh now mama, don't you ask me why

Whoa listen to the music
Whoa listen to the music
Whoa listen to the music
All the time

Well I know, you know better
Everything I say
Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy
And we'll dance
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away
And if I'm feeling good to you
And you're feeling good to me
There ain't nothing we can't do or say
Feeling good, feeling fine
Oh, baby, let the music play

Whoa listen to the music
Whoa listen to the music
Whoa listen to the music
All the time

Like a lazy flowing river
Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
Listening for the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly

Whoa listen to the music
Whoa listen to the music
Whoa listen to the music
All the time
I never thought you'd pick up the phone
It's Friday night you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be sitting at home all alone like me
Nothing on TV, nothing to do
Nothing to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinking 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time
We don't have to be lonely tonight
Need you, want you, I'm right here
We don't have to be lonely tonight
I know we shouldn't, but I don't care
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight
That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips, oh my
I can use to be, baby I want you, and you want me
We don't have to be lonely tonight
Need you, want you, I'm right here
We don't have to be lonely tonight
I know we shouldn't, but I don't care
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight
I can be there in five
One more one last time
We don't have to be lonely tonight
Need you, I'm right here
We don't have to be lonely tonight
Tonight, tonight, yeah yeah
Little by little, now babe
I've come a long, long way
Picking up the pieces
That you threw away
Did you give it up
Did I let you down
Either way, it doesn't matter
Cause I'm finally comin' 'round
I hope you find where you belong
Hello, goodbye
Life goes on
In another town, in a little place
Looking in the eyes of a pretty face
I ain't no fool
I know what she's thinkin'
I can hold her in my arms
But, I could never let her stay
Cause, love
Your sweet love
Still gets in the way
Minute by minute
I hear the voice in my heart
And make a new start
So, I think a little less
I drink a little more
Cause, all in all she's everything
That I've been waiting for
She smiles that smile
I face the fact
Love's a give and take thing
And I can't give it back
And I feel again losing my mind
Banging my head up against the wall
Staring at nothing cause I can't sleep at night
Can't make it stop, yeah I think too much
What do I do? Falling apart
I need a shock straight to my heart
No one would want to be in my shoes right now, oh

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You know you're an expert at complicating things
That's how I'm wired, believe me it's no fun
But you make the war seem like such an easy game
Keeps me and my arguments come under
Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
Make me surrender
Want you so bad
Baby don't stop what you started
Don't ever be done, oh

I always throw the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
No you won't see me popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

You're my medicine

Taillights fading
Daylight breaking
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been running
Yellin' out something
To make you wanna hold onto
The best love ever
Girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you
Mine would be you
Riding rubber wrench, ex living on Ramen
Chapping our ass, 'cause we can't afford Charmin
Rockin' that one ply, one ply
Shaking down the cats, found a buffalo nickel
Medium guitar pick, Burger King pickle
Ooh, it's kinda petrified, petrified
Dollar's worth of gas, didn't even move the needle

Door's unlocked 'cause nothing left to steal

Girl I sure can tell you've been working your butt off
The way you were rocking them second hand cut-offs
Hmm, gonna talk you into taking them off
Score a little discount six pack Keystone
Use a paper sack, twist a little home grown
Go on, get a Friday night on
Girl one of these days gonna look back laughing
Sipping pomegranate sake, at Nobu
But baby 'til then I'm a have-not havin'
Everything I have's got, with you

Those high heels with that sun dress
Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck
Red lips like wine, wanna drink 'em up
And keep on drinkin' 'til you make me drunk
Tied up here, wanna let it down
And just let the rest fall to the ground
You take beautiful to the max
Can't help myself when you look like that
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you
There's a million stars dancing in the sky
A picture perfect moon so bright
But I don't care, I'm looking at you
From where I stand you can beat the view
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight

My eyes have seen
Some amazing things

Grandpa's down
By the two lane
In the blazing sun
Or pouring rain
Sells tomatoes
From the back
Of his pickup truck
Reads the Bible line for line
While sipping on
Some homemade wine
That's who he is
And what he does
He's just like us
My Dad's got
A crippled hand
A casualty of Vietnam
But he's still down
At the sawmill every day
Oh and first thing
'Fore the break of dawn
Mama's got his eggs
And coffee on
My whole life
It's been that way
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
Just as sure as the river flows
We take care of our own
Step right up when someone needs a friend
Last year on the Johnson farm
A fire wiped out the house and barn
The whole town showed up
To build 'em back again, all right
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
Now listen to me, this here is how it used to be
I can see the day that I wont wanna hang out with the boys all night
Yeah and I can see a day when I'll walk off this dead end job for good
And I can see a day when I wont be afraid of getting older
But no matter what I do
Honey I cant see me never lovin' you
[Chorus]
Some things are bound to change
But some things stay the same like they ought to
Some things are meant to be
Just like you and me together
If I die today or if I find a way to live forever
No matter what I do
Darlin' I cant see me never lovin' you
Yeah and I can see a time when you wont think you look as good as you used to
Oh and I can see a time your auburn hair will turn to gray
And I can see a time when you think that you wont blow my mind but I can tell you
No matter what I do
Darlin' I cant see me never lovin' you
[Chorus]
No matter what I do
Honey I cant see me never lovin' you
Don't waste your time, lookin' over your shoulder
Those loves from the past ain't gettin' no closer
When I look in my future, you're all I can see
So honey don't go lovin' on nobody but me
Nobody but me, gonna love you like you oughta be loved, darlin'
Nobody but me, gonna cry if you ever leave
Now you can do what you want to, but I'm askin' pretty please
Don't go lovin' on nobody but me
I took my time to tell you how I feel
Just because I took so long, don't mean that it isn't real.
I ain't got no diamond, but I'm down on my knees, honey
Don't go lovin' on nobody but me
Nobody but me, gonna love you like you oughta be loved, darlin'
Nobody but me, gonna cry if you ever leave
Now you can do what you want to but I'm askin' pretty please, honey
Don't go lovin' on nobody but me

Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me 99
On a prison farm In Georgia 
Close to the Florida line
Well I've been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Takin' care of ol' Red 
Now ol' Red he's the damnedest dog 
That I've ever seen 
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
He's a four legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky to get past the gators in the quicksand fence
But all these years that I've been here ain't nobody got past red
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Well I payed off the guard
And I sent out a letter to my cousin up in Tennessee
And he brought down a blue tick hound she was pretty as she could be
Well they pinned her up in the swamplands
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take ol' Red for his evenin' runs
I'd just drop him off and wait
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Now ol' Red got real used to seein' his lady every night
So I kept him away for three or four days
And waited 'til the time got right
Well I made my run in the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard let red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee and ol' Red was headed south
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Now there's red haired blue ticks
All in the south
Love got me in here
And love got me out
On a good day, when I think about her
I only cry a couple hundred tears
On a good day, when I can't forget about her
I can dull the pain with just a couple beers
On a good day I can even fake a smile
When somebody says I'm gonna be ok
But as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.

So set em up
Here's a hundred dollars keep em comin' joe (whoa whoa)
When I've had enough
Call this number and my brother
Will pour me in his car and drive me home
On a good day, I become the kind of man that even I can barely tolerate
And as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.

On a good day, I would never crash a party
Knowin' she'd be there with someone else
And on a good day, I would have stopped before I started
To make a major fool of myself
On a good day, I'd been quick enough to duck
Before her new love punched me in the face
But as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.

Yeah I only see you joe
When I'm not havin' a good day
No I'm not havin' a good day.
Sunrise slipping through the trees and it looks so pretty in your eyes
I guess I got carried away, kept you out here all night
I hope you don't mind
By the smile I see on your face, 
I think you're havin' a good time, a good time
When I picked you up knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around all over the town
Whatever you like, girl
Ain't a way I can love you the way that I want to
In just one night girl
I know
That I'm just now getting to be somebody that you know
Kick your seat on back 'cause girl we're gonna take it real slow
We already turned last night into tomorrow
And we're just getting started
When I picked you up knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around all over the town
Whatever you like, girl
Ain't a way I can love you the way that I want to
In just one night girl
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna do you right, girl
You ain't a one kiss kind that I won't miss
You ain't just a one night girl
When I picked you up knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around all over the town
Whatever you like, girl
Ain't a way I can love you the way that I want to
In just one night girl
(You ain't a one night girl)
No, no
If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
If I could
Light the world
We could sit
And watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out, oh

If I could
Take you in
Feeling you deep
Beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away
With you as a poison in my veins
I don't wanna fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I died without the one

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out, oh

So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out, oh

If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
John Roy was a boy I knew
Since he was 3 and I was two
Grew up two little houses down from me
The only bad apples on our family tree
Kinda ripened and rottened in our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny
Well now I was smart but I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild with no inhibition
Was about like mixin' fire and gasoline
And he'd say
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
Long around our tenth year
We found two airplane tickets to the hell outta here
Got scholarships to some small town school in Texas
We learned to drink Sangrias 'til the dawn's early light
Eat eggs Ranchero's and throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls we were majorin' in the rodeo
Aw but my favorite memory of school that fall
Was the night John Roy came runnin' down in the hall
Wearin' nothing but cowboy boots and a big sombrero
And he was yellin'
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
And I say we had a little change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney got busted in Japan
And I said we got waylaid when we set foot on Mexican soil
You see the borderman guard with a fu manchu mustach
Kinda stumbled on John's pocketful of American cash
He said "doin' a little funny business in Mexico Amigo"
But all I could think about was savin' my own tail
When he metioned 10 years in a Mexican jail
So I pointed at John Roy and said
It's all his, now please let me go, I mean it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed, when you said
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
Ah we're still best friends
Temporary cell mates
Whoo
Fires are burning, up the forests
Down along the Amazon
There's children starving in Guatemala
They're just barely hanging on

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
And lord while your listen
Could I mention
Some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home

A teenage boy in Mississippi
Brings his daddy's gun to school
A little girl in New York City
Buys cocaine for momma to use

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
And lord while your listen
Could I mention
Some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home

My wife is crying
Our baby's fighting
A battle she may not win
The doctors doing
All that he can
God now it's all in your hands

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
Now I'm just one man a grain of sand
In a troubled world I know
But I've got a problem
Right her at home

I've got a problem
Girl I've been at work all week
Fingers to the bone I need
A little hit of you and me
A little time alone

All day I've been thinking about
Quitting early, skipping out
Hollin' a** to hit the couch
And hang with you at home

We got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We gotta whole lot of nothing to do and nowhere to go
So baby I don't know about you but I'm ready to roll

Let others fool go paint the town
We'll just hold this sofa down
Till Monday morning rolls around
I'll tell you what let's do

You go grab those tater chips
I'll whip up some party dip
And well kick back and take a trip
And sip a beer or two

We got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We gotta whole lot of nothing to do and no where to go
So baby I don't know about you but I'm ready to roll

Yeah we got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We gotta whole lot of nothing to do and no where to go
So baby I don't know about you but I'm ready to roll

Yeah I'm ready to roll
Ready to roll
On the Oklahoma shore of that old Red River
I stand right here and curse my pride
That river runs deep
The current is strong
And the woman I love is on the other side
How did the love we made together
Break apart and drift away
Leave me lost and lonely
On this crimson bank

Red River blue
God pull me through
I'd walk through fire
If that bridge hadn't burned in two
Texas summer sky
Tears in my eyes
She said goodbye and now I'm Red River blue

They say everything is bigger
Under that Texas moon
I'll bet my right hand you won't find a bigger fool
She's probably smiling somewhere tonight
In someone else's arms
I'm here dragging the muddy bottom
For pieces of my heart

Red River blue
God pull me through
I'd walk through fire
If that bridge hadn't burned in two
Texas summer sky
Tears in my eyes
She said goodbye and now I'm Red River blue
She said goodbye and now I'm Red River blue
I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
And offers comin' over the phone
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Now I love country music
And I guess I always will
But these days when I turn on the radio
It's just not the same thrill
I like a song that gives me chill bumps
Now and then there's some that still do
But I'm fed up with the same old vanilla
Hey how 'bout you
I'm tired of the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Hey there mister songwriter
Come and visit in my home
Then tell me about life being perfect
And love that goes on and on and on
Then ride with me in my old Bronco
Down to the factory for eight hours
Then let me introduce you to my supervisor
Then write me a song about sunshine and flowers
And the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
I want to hear a song about passion
I want to hear a song about sin
I want to hear a song about redemption
Yeah sing me one of them
Tell me about a cowboy in Australia
Tell me about a prisoner in China
Tell me about some old stock car driver
Down in Owensburg, South Carolina
Instead of the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Same old, same old, same old
You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Oh
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around
All aboard
It was a big night in December, Chattanooga Tennessee
All the old folks still remember that snowy Christmas Eve
The way Santa saved that holiday, it's still hard to believe
Oh, the weather man was calling for the snow to keep comin' down
And the way that it was fallin', Rudolph never saw the ground
By Christmas day, Santa's sleigh never made it to town
Then all at once they heard that mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then comin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke
Pullin' sixteen, coaches shoutin' ho ho ho
Who needs a sleigh, Santa's got a choo-choo train
Well now, he could barely hold it comin' down the hill so fast
Yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat
But you can't go slow with a Christmas load coming down the railroad tracks
When he pulled into the station and he finally shut her down
There was a big old celebration, everyone gathered 'round
They passed out toys to the girls and boys from miles around
Then all at once they heard a mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then goin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke
Pullin', sixteen coaches shoutin' ho, ho, ho
Who needs a sleigh, when Santa's got a choo-choo train
Oh yeah, ain't need to fly away, Santa's got a choo-choo train
Hmm, hmmm, yeah
I'm standing in my Savior's shadow
He is watching over me
I feel the rain, I hear the thunder
As he cries for me
I'm standing in my Savior's shadow
Grace will lead to where I'm free
I take his hand, we walk together
And his light shines on me
Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be
I'm standing in my Savior's shadow
Following his footsteps there
Every mountain, every ocean
He hears my every prayer
Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be
Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
I'm who I'm supposed to be
He meets her at the front door, he can tell she's had a hard day, at work
She's been needing him and he's sure been wantin' her
He touches her with tenderness,takes her in his arms and takes it slow
What a shame she can't get that at home
What a shame, she, can't get that at home
There's nothing back there but a lonely house
and love ain't all about wood and stone
He satisfies all her needs and wants
What a shame she can't get that at home
After the lovin', they lie there and talk for a while
She loves how he listens, and he sure loves to see her smile
He wants to keep her, but he loves her enough to let her go
What a shame, she can't, get that at home
What a shame, she, can't get that at home
There's nothing back there but a lonely house
and love ain't all about wood and stone
He satisfies all her needs and wants
What a shame she can't get that at home
He satisfies all her needs and wants
What a shame she can't get that at home
On Friday night when I see her out
Even in a crowd she's hard to miss
There ain't a man breathing air
Who wouldn't stop and stare
And the best part is..
[Chrous:]
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad we want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
She'll close her eyes when the music plays
And the way she sways
Really rocks the room
She doesn't mean to get things stirred
It's just a thing in her that was born to move
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
I'm gonna work my courage up
Tell her I'm in love
I'm in love a lot
She has my heart on a string
Like everything the girl has got
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through
Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and make her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that, maybe I
Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone, she wouldn't be gone
She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change
She was leaving
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out,
God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin', they ain't sayin'
Now, I'm cursing like a fool, praying it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes.
Find her beg her for one more try, until then damn it I'll
Be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone
I wouldn't be beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone
Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter, oh at least a time or two

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

Sleep in heavenly peace
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas

Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
Hear them ring, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all the bustle you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
Hear them ring, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Soon it will be Christmas day
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car drivin' dude with a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird an' then he was gone
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and warm breezes blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of no where a Mercedes Benz
Came cruisin' up and whipped right in
Some beach
Somewhere
There's no where to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot Senoritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach
Somewhere
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You're not gonna feel a thing we'll give you some Novocaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
Then he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evenin' air
On some beach
Somewhere
On some beach, somewhere
If time has no end and if time has no end 
A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity 
A circle an eternal loop 
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth
Someday will we know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday 
Before we were babies 
There's nothing we recall and when we go back 
Will it fade to black and that's all 
Or could we be destined for some other time and place 
And have we lived other lives our memories have erased
Someday will we know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday 
Will we see Jesus comin' as the sunshine fills the night 
Or when we die will we fly into the light 
Will we all be reunited with the ones who've gone away 
And will we love each other the way we do today I believe 
Someday we'll know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday
Well I went to bed in Memphis
And I woke up in Hollywood
I got a quarter in my pocket
And I'd call you if I could
But I don't know why
I gotta fly
I wanna rock and roll this party
I still wanna have some fun
I wanna leave you feeling breathless
Show you how the west was won
But I gotta fly, I gotta fly

Like Steve McQueen
All I need's a fast machine
I'm gonna make it all right
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight

I ain't takin' shit off no one
Baby that was yesterday
I'm an all American rebel
Making my big getaway
Yeah you know it's time
I gotta fly

Like Steve McQueen
All I need's a fast machine
I'm gonna make it all right
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight

Like Steve McQueen
Like Steve McQueen

We got rock stars in the White House
All our pop stars look like porn
All my heroes hit the highway
They don't hang out here no more

You can try me on my cell phone
You can page me all night long
But you won't catch this free bird
I'll already be long gone

Like Steve McQueen
All we need's a fast machine
And we're gonna make it all right

Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight
Like Steve McQueen
All we need's a fast machine
And we're gonna make it all right
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight
Just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls
Children of the corn field
Tryna turn a shift job into a dollar bill
We wear them muddy boots
Stay true to how we're raised
Ain't nothin' bout us fake
You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer
Just a bunch of John Deere junkies
Gettin' funky to some old Hank
Nothin' been stuck in the mud that we can't
Hook up to a rusty chain in the summer or in the rain
Yeah, it's a kind of thing
You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer
You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks

Pain is growing like a vine stranglin' my heart
When I think the worst is over, that's right when it starts
Someone says your name, sometimes I don't feel a thing
But then there's days like today, whoa, that are suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still suffocating
The memory of what used to be cuts me like a thorn
Loneliness starts rollin' in like thunder from the storm
My strength starts to sway, I feel the winds of change
It's such a paralyzing place, oh, and it's suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still suffocating
Let the rain wash it all away
Can't you love me another day?
I curse myself
Cause nothin's changed, nothin's changed
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still
Suffocating
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
And them boys from Amarillo stop wearin' those boots and jeans
When Memphis ain't got the blues
That's when I'll stop lovin' you
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans

Baby, I don't mind you askin'
If there's gonna come a day
When I'll say goodbye
Maybe, I guess anything could happen
But it's as close to never
As your ever gonna find

When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
And them boys from Amarillo stop wearin' those boots and jeans
When there's no tequila in Mexico
That's when I'm gonna let you go
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans

Darlin' some things won't ever change
My love is one of those things

When New York is a one horse town
That's when I won't need ya around
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
When it's sunny in Seattle and snowing down in New Orleans
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call,
No pressure at all
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did
You can't shoot me down 'cause you've already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road just as far as you wanna go
Baby, I'll do,
Whatever you wanna do, wanna do
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did
Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did
Yeah, it'd sure be cool if you did
Well I'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars
All them old country songs Daddy used to play
I'm crazy about Friday nights, cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake

But I'm ten times crazier without about your lovin', girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

Well I'm all about a weekend, kickin' with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But don't you go thinkin' that I won't leave 'em hanging
'Cause even though I'm crazy about them good ol' boys

I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

I know you love me girl that's easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me

I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
Get up, put your clothes on, baby
Come on, let's do something crazy
Take a midnight drive down
An old dirt road
I wanna see your bare feet on my dash
The night wind blowing your hair back
Slide across that seat
And sit real close
Baby, let's go
Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll kick 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
We'll take some blankets and we'll make a spread
I'll tuck you into my pick-up bed
We'll watch the country stars
Puttin' on a show
I want to see your bare skin in the moonlight
Kiss your lips, girl, and hold you all night
Make a lot of love
And make it real slow
Baby, let's go
Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll shuck 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
We've been runnin' 'round doin' this and that
It's time we got back to what we're good at
Snugglin' up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll shuck 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
We'll be doin' that thing we do
Doin' that thing we do
There's a house that's a little run down
This city ain't never found
It's miles and miles from a paved road
That's where we grew up
Seven children raised on love
When life gets hard that's where we go
[Chorus]
Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood
But it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call
That's what I call home
Daddy built it with his own two hands
Overlooking his grandpa's land
Now through the years a lot has changed
But driving up this gravel road
I get that feeling in my soul
I thank God some things still remain
Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood
But it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call
That's what I call home
Once I get myself through that old screen door
The world can't touch me anymore
[Chorus]
That's what I call home
That's what I call home
My brothers said that I was rotten to the core.
I was the youngest child, so I got by with more.
I guess she was tired by the time I came along, she'd laugh until she cried.
I could do no wrong. She would always save me, because I was her baby.

I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the bayou,
I drove a truck in Birmingham.
Turned 21 in Cincinnati, I called home to mom and daddy,
I said your boy is now a man.
She said I don't care if your 80, you'll always be my baby.

She loved that photograph of our whole family,
She'd always point us out for all her friends to see.
That's Greg he's doing great, he really loves his job.
And Ronny with his to kids, how 'bout that wife he's got.
And that one's kind of crazy, but that one's my baby.

I got a call in Alabama said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly.
'Cause your mama really needs you, and says shes gotta see you,
She might not make it through the night.
The whole way I drove 80 so she could see her baby.

She looked like she'd been sleepin'
And my family had been weeping by the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been take and my heart it was breakin'
I never got to say goodbye,
I softly kissed that lady and cried just like a baby.
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer
Really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
Funny thing about dreamers
When the dream is in their sights
Just to get where they're going
They leave a lot of good things behind
Guess you could call me a dreamer
I've seen it all come true
So I smile when I need to look happy
Do all the things they tell me to
I'm a big self-made man
And a fool who can't understand
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
If I could only make the future
An extension of my past
I'd take these broken memories
And make those moments last
Now that my ship has come
I wonder what have I done
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
Whisper, baby
There a roadhouse just outside of town on a two-lane blacktop
Where all the folks come to hear country music play
And every year the city's gettin' closer, Lord knows it won't stop
And old Hank the bartender gave us the bad news today, yeah he said
[Chorus]
This land was our land but Lord now it's their land
And we're still here, but not for long
So let's raise a cold one and play all the old ones
Till we've sung the last country song
There's 300 acres of cotton corn and a little bit of gravel
All bought up by a builder from downtown
Tomorrow when the earth starts a-shakin' and the walls start to rattle
A big bulldozer's gonna take Hank's roadhouse down, so everybody sing
[Chorus]
Will we play "Swingin'" or "He Stopped Loving Her Today"
It's really sad to see it end this way
[Chorus]
Till we've sung the last country song
Oh we've sung the last country song
Oh we've sung the last country song
He was sittin' at the bar, sippin' on a regular Coke
We were drinkin' and smokin' and makin' him the butt of our jokes
We all said, "Man, what happened to you? Why can't you just have a few?"
He said, "I would if I could, but it's probably best that I don't."
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine
I get loud, I get proud, and it gets worse
Well, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Naw, there ain't no in-between
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
A couple of cold ones, and somebody hands me a shot
Hell, even buck-tooth and bow-legged women start lookin' hot
And pretty soon I'm bummin' cigarettes, and sweet talkin' some big brunette
Yeah, once I get on a roll, ain't no tellin' where I'll stop
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine
I get loud, I get proud, and it gets worse
Well, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Naw, there ain't no in-between
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yep, yep
Hmm, that's what I'm talking about
Man, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
And they can't get me off the karaoke machine
The more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, the more I drink, the more I drink, the more I drink
We don't like to go out shopping, we don't care what's on sale
Just wanna sit with a bag full of chips watchin' the NFL
When you come over at half time, you say does this dress fit too tight
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie 
And say uh uh looks just right
Well that's the truth about men, that's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf on our days off, scratch and spit and cuss
And no matter what line we hand you when we come dragging in
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry, and it's probably gonna happen again
We hate watchin' Steel Magnolias, we like Rambo and Die Hard four
Jump up and down like fools when we see the new tools
At the Home Depot store we don't really 
Wanna take you to dinner at some fancy restaurant
The only reason we do is 'cause we know it leads to 
The one thing that we all want
Well, that's the truth about men, that's the truth about guys
We'd rather pick guitars and work on cars
Than work on the problems in our lives
And though we say it to you every now and then
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry, and it's probably gonna happen again
Well, if you wanna know what we're all thinkin', it's nothing too complex
It's just something cold for drinking and a whole lot of s,e, yes
That's the truth about men, that's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf and drive around lost
And scratch and spit and a whole lot of other disgusting stuff
And no matter what line we give you when we come crawling in
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry and it's probably gonna happen again
We ain't wrong, We ain't sorry, and it's probably gonna happen 
Sure it's gonna happen, you know it's gonna happen again
And that's the truth about men
There's so many things we can do this Christmas
Just once I wanna go on a ride in a one horse sleigh
Go caroling down the street while everybody listens
Singing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, jingling all the way
And if snows just a little too much and there ain't no place to go
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe
Hang up the cards from the people we love who miss us
Call up the neighbors and open up a bottle of cheer
Umm, there's so many we things can do this Christmas
Ha ha, join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
Oh, yeah
And if it snows just a little too much and there ain't no place to go
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe
Hang up the cards from the people we love, who miss us
Call up the neighbors and open up a bottle of cheer
There's so many we things can do this Christmas
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
We were talking on a boardwalk
We were lit up when the lights came down
So we drifted toward the music
And you kissed me as the sound
Of my favorite band was playing
But I couldn't hear them 'cause my heart
Was beating loud and out of rhythm
As you drowned out all the dark
I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water, you were the ocean
I was a compass, I couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how, but I was broken
I was a castaway with no end
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave, the wave, the wave
That washed it all, that washed it all away
We talked for a couple of hours
We got salt all over our jeans
And we laughed about forever
What the hell did that really mean?
And all of sudden, thanks to you
My favorite color's blue
I never saw you coming
A sweet salvation and I never knew
I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water, you were the ocean
I was a compass, I couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how, but I was broken
I was a castaway with no end
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave, the wave, the wave
That washed it all, that washed it all away
I was a town closed for good
I was a Ferris wheel with the lights burned out
'Till you came along
When you came along
I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water, you were the ocean
I was a compass, I couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how, but I was broken
I was a castaway with no end
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave, the wave, the wave
That washed it all, that washed it all away
Yeah, you washed it all away
You were the wave, the wave, the wave
Yeah, you washed it all away
We're looking for the king, the new Messiah
We're following the star shining brighter
Old man, won't you help us if you can,
He shook his head but he pointed his hand

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem

I see you've traveled far, bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for the new King's pleasures
I've heard that a king might come
But up till now there hasn't been one

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem
There's a tear in my beer 
'Cause I'm cryin' for you, dear 
You are on my lonely mind
Into these last few beers 
I have shed a million tears
You are on my lonely mind
I'm gonna keep drinkin'
Until I'm petrified
And then maybe these tears 
Will leave my eyes
There's a tear in my beer 
'Cause I'm crying' for you dear
You are on my lonely mind
Last night I walked the floor
And the night before
You are on my lonely mind
It seems my life is through
And I'm so doggone blue
You are on my lonely mind
I'm gonna keep drinkin'
Till I can't move a toe
And then maybe my heart
Won't hurt me so
There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm cryin' for you dear
You are on my lonely mind
Lord, I've tried and I've tried
But my tears I can't hide
You are on my lonely mind
All these blues that I've found
Have really got me down
You are on my lonely mind
I'm gonna keep drinkin' till I can't even think
Cause in the last week I ain't slept a wink
There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm crying for you dear
You are on my lonely mind
You are on my lonely mind
There's a campfire burning on the Mississippi River bank
My old pickup speakers are cranking out alot of Hank
That's the sheriff's daughter dancin' on my hood
With an empty bottle this can't be good
There's an unwritten law in this sleepy little town
There ain't no drinkin' on the river when the sun goes down
Think I see the blue lights comin' through the woods
Its the sheriff and his posse, this can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world is comin'
With a Buffard T kinda law man closin' in
She just keeps on rockin' guess I better do some talkin
She's too dumb to run n' I'm too drunk to swim
This can't be good, this can't be good, this can't be good
Aww stay tuned...
This ol' haybarn's full of last years grass
I got a whole tin can full of campfire gas
Theres a little bitty flame on this piece of firewood
And when it all comes together it can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world was comin'
With a wildfire burnin' like a freight train outta control
She just keeps on rockin', babe there ain't no time for talking
Throw her over my shoulder run with everything I can
Hold on babe looks like were jumpin' in...
Now you know, when we get to the other side, were gonna have to take all
These wet clothes off, and hang out awhile... you know, this could be good
Yeah!
Well I've been thinking 'bout it an' its been too long
So put them dirty dishes down and leave that laundry alone
Come on
Take me by the hand and follow me to our room
You don't have to tell me this is way over due
I know, so lets go
[Chorus]
I wanna be with you
Come let me kiss you
And I don't mean a peck on the cheek
Girl tonight I'm making up for lost time
I hope you gotta good night sleep
I ain't gonna rush it
Girl you're gonna love it
Cause I intend to do it right
But I'll go ahead and warn ya
This is gonna take all night
Now I don't understand how life can get in the way
Of me and the prettiest girl in the world making love
But it does
[Chorus]
I wanna be with you
Come let me kiss you
An' I don't mean a peck on the cheek
Girl tonight I'm making up for lost time
I hope you gotta good night sleep
I'm gonna pay attention to every square inch of you
I intend to do this right
But I'll go ahead and warn ya
This is gonna take all night
Yeah I'll show ya how I love ya
But girl its gonna take all night
There's music in the city
And the lights are on display
There's a big old tree for all to see
Where the children run and play

I look out through my window
Somethin' just don't seem right
TiIl I said hello and heard her voice
On the other end of the line

Now it's Christmas, Christmas I'm hurrying' on my way
Christmas, Christmas, like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well, I don't have to hear no jingle bells, just the ringing of the phone
Mama just called and said it's time
For me to come home

The pies are in the oven
You can almost taste the air
And it warms my heart to feel her love
And know how much she cares
It's funny how going back can get you back where you belong
It's the difference between in just a melody and my favorite Christmas song

Now, it's Christmas, Christmas I'm hurrying' on my way
Christmas, Christmas, like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh

Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burnin' through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on
Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on
Once she gets it started
Man, it's all night long
She's the needle on the vinyl
Of a midnight song
She's turning me on, turning me on
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on, yeah
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
(Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on)
(Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on)
(Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on)
Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around
As I wander through the dark
Through the midnight mist
Remembering our last kiss
Do you know how much you're missed
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry
Dying without you
I know you're somewhere
Looking up there too
Right now that's all two distant
Hearts can do
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
Picturing your face
Flowers in your hair
Like you always wear
I can see you there
Longing to be touched
But you're out of reach
Hold on please
Won't you wait for me
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry
Dying without you
I know you're somewhere
Looking up there too
Right now that's all two distant
Hearts can do
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around
Leave the radio on just to hear a voice other than mine
Cause I can't bear to hear the cold truth running through my mind.
Cause everything I did wrong just keeps haunting me, it won't let me be
Lying here without you, girl I'm starting to see why you gave up on me.
What I wouldn't give just to go back when you were in my life I'd do it right this time.
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong and I'll never hold you again, cause of what I wouldn't give.
It kills me to think how much you tried to make things work.
I wouldn't listen to you, all I would do is put myself first.
I took you for granted and I pushed you away a little more each day.
Somewhere inside this hell I have seen my mistakes oh but now it's too late.
What I wouldn't give just to go back when you were in life, I'd do it right this time.
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong and I'll never hold you again, cause of what I wouldn't give.
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know was wrong and I'll never hold you again cause of what I wouldn't give, 
Cause of what I wouldn't give
I can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time 
Honey you are so persuasive 
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind 
I don't mean to drive you crazy
Comin' off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does
But keep on asking if you're inclined
But, you can't handle what's on my mind
No, you can't handle what's on my mind.
The keys are still hanging on the front door
You're hanging all over me
And in between kisses I hear your whispers
Something 'bout loving me
There's a half glass sittin' on the table
The other half spilled on the bed
I'm half-way believin'
You're really meaning every sweet word you just said
Or is it just that bottle of red?
When the wine wears off 
And the buzz is gone
When the room stops spinnin' 'round and 'round
Will you still be holding on?
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong?
Tell me, will you still be mine
Baby, when the wine wears off?
When I wake up in the morning
Will you be in my arms?
When the sun starts shining through those blinds
Will you mean what you said in the dark?
Or will I have a headache and a broken heart?
When the wine wears off 
And the buzz is gone
When the room stops spinnin' 'round and 'round
Will you still be holding on?
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong?
Tell me, will you still be mine
Baby, when the wine wears off?
I don't want you to stop kissing me now
Keep on loving me, laying me down
I close my eyes and hide from these doubts
Do my best to not worry about
When the wine wears off 
And the buzz is gone
When the room stops spinnin' 'round and 'round
Will you still be holding on?
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong?
Tell me, will you still be mine
Baby, when the wine wears off?
Will you still be mine
Baby, when the wine wears off?
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates 'cause you're feelin' bad?
Do you paint your toes 'cause you bite your nails?
Call up momma when all else fails?
Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right, are you thinkin' of me?
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
My oh my, you're so good-looking
But who are you when I'm not looking?
I'm a rebel
I've been known to dance with the devil
So how'd I get up on your level?
You're an angel, sent from Heaven down to me
I'm rough around the edges
You're a snapshot of perfection
I was headed in the wrong direction
I was reckless
Now I just got one question
Why me?
Out of everybody baby
Why me?
You coulda picked anybody
Why me?
When I see you lookin' at me, I gotta ask
What did I do?
To get to be the one you gave your heart to
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who, woulda thought you would wanna wake up
Everyday beside me
Baby why me?
I remember night one
Looking around for the right one
Saw you sitting there, said while I'm done
And I walked over, even though you're outta my league
You were diamonds in the sky, I was dirt on the plough
You're All-American pretty, I'm a one horse town
First smile you gave me, I was thinkin' it then
And I'm still thinkin' it now
Why me?
Out of everybody baby
Why me?
You coulda picked anybody
Why me?
When I see you lookin' at me, I gotta ask
What did I do?
To get to be the one you gave your heart to
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who, woulda thought you would wanna wake up
Everyday beside me
Baby why me?
Yeah baby why me?
Baby why me?
Why me?
What did I do right?
Why me?
Kissin' you goodnight
You say
You'll never let me go
Oh it's crazy girl, I guess I'll never know
Why me?
Out of everybody baby
Why me?
You coulda picked anybody
Why me?
When I see you lookin' at me, I gotta ask
What did I do?
To get to be the one you gave your heart to
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who, woulda thought you would wanna wake up
Everyday beside me
Baby why me?
Oh baby why me?
Baby why me?
She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence, in her ears
Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
And if by chance that I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time
And if allowed just one possession
I would take her in my arms, to be mine
Be careful how you touch her, she'll awaken
As sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always paying for a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear, so she goes
Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild
Let her cry, oh, she's a lady
Let her dream, 'cause she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
She's a flower growing wild, she's a flower growing wild
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married?
We'll say No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
You ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller and you're a whole lot shorter
Let's dance all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters
'Cause you ain't Dolly, no, and you ain't Porter
Well I noticed you right off the bat in those cowboy boots
Who couldn't help but see you in that rhinestone suit
That's cause I'm the reigning queen of karaoke night
Well if I get drunk enough to sing, hell I just might
Hey now, don't you worry cowboy, cause I'll get you through
We'll sing a cheating song just like they used to do
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller
Yeah, but you're a whole lot shorter
Let's drink all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
You'll probably see me country singing on The Voice someday
Yeah and I'm the guy they wrote about in 50 Shades of Grey
Why don't you come on back to my place and you can have your way
Well baby that sounds tempting, but I just can't stay
Oh we won first prize cowboy, let's just split the dough
Honey I will always love you, but we'll never know
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller
Yeah, and you're a whole lot shorter
We danced all night and filled the jukebox full of quarters
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter, no
No, you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
Baby you'll find
There's only one love
Yours and mine
I've got so much love
And needing you so
My love for you
I'll never let go
I've got so much love
All I want is to hold you
Let me show how much I love you baby (Show you)
I don't mind and I don't mind (Loving you)
Girl I love you
There's no one above you
You are the sun
You are the rain
That makes my life this foolish game
You need to know
I love you so
And I'd do it all again and again
Tell me it's true
I can't believe you do what you do
I've got so much love
And my love you'll see
We'll stay together, just you and me
I've got so much love
Only you (know me)
Tell me how to love you baby (show me)
I don't mind and I don't mind (tell me)
Girl, I love you
Always thinking of you
You are the sun
You are the rain
That makes my life this foolish game
You need to know
I love you so
And I'd do it all again and again
I know you know the way I feel
And I need your love for always
Cause when I'm with you 
I fall in love
Again and again and again, Baby
You are the sun
You are the rain
That makes my life this foolish game
You need to know
I love you so
And I'd do it all again and again
Every time I look into your lovely eyes
I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Every time I hold you, I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I'm your man
I live (I live) my life (my life) to be (to be) with you
No one (no one) can do (can do) the things (the things) you do, baby
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything you want (you got it)
Anything you need (you got it)
Anything at all
Anything baby
(You got it) anything!
I'm glad to give my love to you
I know you feel the way I do, baby
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything at all
Baby
You got it
I want to thank the storm that brought the snow (uh uh)
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow (uh)
But I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
It barely took a breath to realize
We're gonna be a classic for all time
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
I never thought I'd find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oh oh (oh thank you baby)
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
You always get dolled up for your party
Good thing your birthday only comes once a year
Cause you always forget that you're so small
You can't take all that alcohol
And you wind up over my shoulder and into the car
But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
I don't care if your hair's a mess from the night before
Your headaches and your fussin' and cussin' the sun
The makeup you had on your face
Is now all over your pillow case
And you're curled up under the covers into a ball
But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
So baby don't you ever doubt
When father time starts drawing out
Those lines around your eyes
Cause you'll always be
You'll always be
Beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
Always be
Always be beautiful
To me
Wheels turn like my memories
And the head-lights shine like my used-to-be's
And time, time's taking way too long
And forgiveness, well I hope its not too far gone
[Chorus]
A hundred miles from her is where I need to be
And a hundred miles from now I'm gonna hit my knees
Say I miss you oh I love you and I'm sorry
And if she can find the way to take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for the past
All my answers, all my hopes, All my fears
Are a hundred miles from here
I, I told her I had to go
And now I know what I didn't know
And this road could lead me back to your door
But can it take me to a girl who can love me more
[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys kicking it back
Or the guy with the guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can, stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that
I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl, no
It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room
And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl
The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gonna let her, never gonna let her go
Woah-oh, yeah
I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl
(Guy with the girl)
No, I don't mind being the guy with the girl
(Guy with the girl)
Yeah, I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it, baby
I don't mind it, baby
I'm always the guy with the girl
Had to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
How to lean back, fake a yawn
Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss
How to turn a twenty into Saturday night
How to make her momma let you have her til midnight
How not to let her know she's got you caught
These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout a promise and forever
All you know is nothing's better than being together
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make 'em sound so sweet
That she'd never ever say no, no no no
These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout living ever after
But you know you're nothing unless you get to have her
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Oh, you won't believe the way she's got you acting
She'll talk you into things you never thought would happen
When the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Mm, yeah, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
Don't bother telling me what I got coming in the morning
I already know
I got some feelgood pills and a red Gatorade by my bed
Ready to go
I'm gonna do my best to dance with every girl in this bar
Before they shut it down
Then I'll pay my tab, climb in a cab
Hit another spot downtown
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries, we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight
Hey pretty thing
I've been looking at you since the moment that you walked in
I got some wild-ass buddies that love spending money
And I see you brought a couple of friends
Just tell me your name
I don't need your number or a date next Saturday
Baby let's act like fools break a few rules
Party the night away
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries, we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight
Ha ha yeah, slide
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries, we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
I said tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight
Yeah it's all about tonight
Come on, it's all about tonight
We're gonna get our swerve on, our buzz on
It's all about tonight
Come on baby, I wouldn't worry about that
It's all about tonight, now, c'mon
There was a time
I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd
I used to pull away when she would kiss my face
And touch my hair
She didn't care who saw
[Chorus]
She was all over me
And i used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that i love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
The sky is blue
But from where i stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What i wouldn't give if i could feel
The familiar touch of her love holding me again
[Chorus: x2]
Anyone else would shake my hand
Wish me luck, be proud for a friend
But a jealous guy won't share the sun
When it feels threatened by every'one
Yeah, anyone else would open the door
Helping me find what I was looking for
When you smile there's always a catch
Like I didn't earn everything I have

(Hey, hey, hey) why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, whatever I've got
You want it all for yourself
Why can't you be happy for anyone else?

'Cause nobody else would make me feel dumb
For being myself or needing someone
And I can't tell, are you ever sincere?
Did they treat you like this when you showed up here?

(Hey, hey, hey) why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, whatever I've got
You want it all for yourself
Why can't you be happy for anyone else?

(Hey, hey, hey) why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, you want it all
And you want everyone to see
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't wanna leave your side
For that lonesome road
But here I go
Climbin' back behind the wheel
Fifty feet of chrome and steel
And a load they need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go
I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
Sometimes late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me where I like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pullin' ribbons from your hair
And your kiss
Girl, that's what I miss
Still I drive these horses
Through the rain and snow
This high speed rodeo's all I know
I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
Through the middle of the night unknown
On the ride that won't let me go
She left without leavin' a number
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got

If your callin' 'bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowlin'
If you've got somethin' to sell your wastin' your time, I'm not buyin'
If it's anybody else wait for the tone you know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days and then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake and I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home on Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin I still love you

Well this time she left her number
But not another word
When she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If your callin' 'bout my heart it's still yours
I should have listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy this is no machine your talkin' to
Can't you tell this is Austin and I still love you

I still love you
This old Buick's like a needle on a compass
Pointed due west
I remember her smile like June sunflowers
And the look of her body as she slipped out of that dress
God, I'm such a mess
Never a mornin' person, but that girl's still in bed
The sheets are tanglin', her little arm is danglin'
The last dream from her pretty head
I told her I was leavin'
She didn't believe the words I said
[Chorus:]
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
Back there, again
She'll put on her makeup and drink from her tea cup
Glance at that silver frame
See, I took our picture and then it'll hit her
She'll cry out with pain
Maybe, whisper my name
[Chorus]
No one's gonna make me
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin'
Back there, again
Now, don't blame her mama for makin' me promise
Don't come around here, no more
She said, "Maybe your life's gone to hell
But, that's a tour of duty she didn't sign up for"
When you can't save yourself, you save somebody else
Maybe that's how you survive
I'm runnin' away so she don't have to see
A life in slow-motion suicide
You throw in the towel, they call you a coward
Tell ya fight, don't cut and run
I ain't no hero, but the truth is I know
It's the bravest thing I've ever done
The hardest part is knowing what we could have
Should have become
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
No one's gonna make me
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin'
Goin'
To break her heart, again
[Blake]
Well the moon just came over the tree tops
And the whipper wheel started to sing
So I slipped down the hill
Got into the still
And drank til my ears started to ring
I followed a trail to through the hollow
To a shack back in the woods
Its my eighteenth birthday
Honey come out and play
Its time that we got to no good
[Chorus: Both]
Now I ain't afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I'm a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Come lay down on my bare skin rug
[Miranda]
My dress is torn up and tattered
My daddy left a long time ago
And my hair just hangs down
I never made it to town
Momma said that's where bad people go
But me and my sister been talkin'
Shes eighteen one year older than me
She laid down with a man
I want to understand what she says
I'll never believe
[Chorus]
[Blake]
Now I need a woman
[Miranda]
And I need a man
[Both]
We ain't got nobody
An' we ain't even kin
Now I ain't afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I'm a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Lay me down on your bare skin rug
Come lay down on my bare skin rug
Without even trying, when I close my eyes 
I see you walking 'round the side of my head
Looking up at the sky
Shining brighter than single a sunrise
It's ever burnin' red
And I wanna hold you, hold you
Rolling in the warm sunshine
And if I never told you, told you
I'm givin' you the rest of my life
'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna dance with my baby
In the dead of the night
Just keep on movin' and groovin' to the daylight
I'll be right beside you, baby
Till the end of time
I'll be braggin' about you, baby
You can bet up and calling up all of my friends
Don't you know that I've been counting down the days
Feeling just crazy enough to call up your old man
And I wanna hold you, hold you
Rolling in the warm sunshine
And if I never told you, told you
I'm givin' you the rest of my life
'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna dance with my baby
In the dead of the night 
Just keep on movin' and groovin' to the daylight
I'll be right beside you, baby
Till the end of time
I wanna hold you, hold you
Rolling in the warm sunshine
And if I never told you, told you
I'm givin' you the rest of my life
'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna dance with my baby
In the dead of the night 
Just keep on movin' and groovin' to the daylight
I'll be right beside you, baby
Till the end of time
I wanna hold you, hold you
Baby where are you going now?
Do you ever really know?
Oh you hate to be tied down
But you hate to sleep alone
I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There's just something about you baby
There's nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn't hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me
Are you driving up the coast?
Are you wearing any shoes?
Did you outrun all your ghosts?
Like you were always tryna do
I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There's just something about you baby

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't by the same dear if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling (blue, blue)
That's when those blue memories start calling (blue, blue)
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(Blue, blue) think I'm felling better already (blue, blue)

You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
Red red red red red red red red redneck
Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ole Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At a honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night what? (that's right)
Yeah, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
In your 4 wheel drive (a country boy can survive)
Yeah the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust

But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yeah, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'
For the boys 'round here

Down to the river side
Been forever since I've been gone
Haven't held you in so long
Miss you more than words can say
Guess we've got a little off track
But love knows a way back
Through the storms and pouring rain

Got my hands on the wheel and I'm flying
Heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
Lightning on the stampede of lightning roll
I'm bringing back the sunshine
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh

Every moment, every sweet kiss
All the loving that we both missed
It's okay to let em go

Yesterday's all forgotten
And today we start rocking
Somewhere underneath the rainbow

Got my hands on the wheel and I'm flying
Heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
Lightning on the stampede of lightning roll

I'm bringing back the sunshine
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh

Bringing back, oh yeah
Girl getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks, back at the bar, thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
You better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Yeah, first of all we came here to forget
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with you before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
You better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget
I saw you sittin' there sippin' red wine down at Causen Mills
I knew you'd prob'ly be outta my league but I though, what the hell?
Aw, what the hell
Five dollars a glass was kickin' my butt but I kept on buyin'
I kinda thought you were into me
So I kept on tryin' to get them sparks a'flyin'
In my forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
All I had to my name was a big ol' truck and a little ol' place
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not too
Hoo-hoo-hoo
I asked you if you ever stared up at the stars from a tailgate
Down by the river with a six pack
You said no, but it sure sounds great
You climbed up in my old truck
Sittin' right beside me
I cranked up a country song
And you started smilin'
Yeah, this ol' boy was stylin'
In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
I missed work for three days
Kissin' on you, didn't get paid
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not to
Hoo-hoo-hoo
We been together ever since that night
You're still in love with that same old guy
That same old guy, old guy
In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
Yeah, we set a date for next spring
Workin' two jobs, pickin' out rings
I can't help but think
I can't afford to love you
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not too
Hoo-hoo-hoo
I can't afford not too
Love on you
On a Mississippi mornin' 
My dad yelled out a warnin'
Son you better hit that cotton patch soon
And on my way on down the field
As I passed Old Johnson's Mill
I saw Becky Morgan, skinny dippin' nude.
Well I couldn't help but stop and stare
Hypnotized I stood right there 
Enchanted by the beauty that I'd seen 
Then she gave me a come here smile
Nearly drove my body wild 
I fell down tryin' to kick off my jeans.
Well on that cotton pickin' mornin'
I met up with Beck Morgan
You know that day I didn't get to work on time
And in the days of my December 
I know I will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
Well I lost my job that summer
But I guess I had it comin' 
Cause that pickin' cotton just wasn't on my mind
But you don't get too much money
When you got a Tupelo honey
Keepin' you cool in the Mississippi hot sunshine.
And every cotton pickin' mornin'
I met up with Becky Morgan
The whole dang I never got to work on time
And in the days of my December 
I know I will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
We've come along way since then
Now I own that cotton gin
And I bought that mill 
Just to make her smile 
And to keep our love from growin' old
We still go down there to that hole
Skinny dip and Becky is just as wild.
And every cotton pickin' mornin'
I wake up with Becky Morgan
And to this day I never got to work on time
And in the days of our December 
I know we'll will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
And every cotton pickin' mornin'
I wake up with Becky Morgan
And to this day I never got to work on time
And in the days of our December 
I know we'll will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
We were sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time
We were sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
Cat Diesel Power cap pulled down low
Makin that bacon, row by row
Can't get them muscles at the YMCA
It's from choppin' cotton, cuttin' corn and slingin' that hay
Been heavy liftin' since the crack of dawn
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He wears an old felt hat on his head
Got a saddle for a pillow, and the ground for a bed
Spurs on his heels, reins in his hands
Drivin' cattle, ropin' steers and burnin' his brand
There ain't no lettin' up all day long
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

Yea behind every good man, there's a woman
She's the one thing that keeps him goin', keeps him goin'

She's up in the mornin' yawnin' with that coffee pot on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in her blood, backwoods in her bones
No doubt about it that girl's country strong

Cowboy's, plowboys, good hearted women
They're all country strong
I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well here I am
It ain't no big surprise
You got a broken heart to kill
Tired of knowing how it feels
When you learn you been living
A lie
Oh, and ain't that a shame
You shouldn't feel such pain
But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
So go ahead and take your shot
Drink your whiskey on the rocks
And tell me how
You'll never find the one
But Lord knows it hurts me bad
Every time I see you sad
Knowing that my love
Goes on and on
Oh, it just ain't right
You're alone tonight
But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
You can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well, here I am
It ain't no big surprise
Where are you now?
Who's holdin' you now?
When your world stands still, do you remember?
Leaves were fallin'
We were fallin'
Almost like a dream, do you remember?

Seasons changed
We both changed
Sometimes I go back to when

We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?

Where I am now
Is where I should be now
You're so far away, but always with me

And it seems like
Another life
Whenever I go back to when

We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?

We ran, we kissed, we learned to love, to live

We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doin' what she likes

She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes

She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doin' what she likes

And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes

She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwin' words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doin' what she likes
Doin' what she likes

She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes

Yeah, I like doin' what she likes
Hmm, yeah
Girl, when I look at you
You look through me like I'm not even there
I'm trying not to give up
To be strong but I'm afraid to say I'm scared
I can't find the place your heart is hiding
And I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fighting
Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby, I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
What if when I'm long gone it dawns on you, you just might want me back?
Let me make myself clear
If I leave here its done, I'm gone, that's that
You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it?
Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby, I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
Baby, I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
Hey, baby I just asked your daddy
If I could take your hand
He said, "Boy, over my dead body"
Guess I ain't his kinda man
But I love you and you love me
So, baby I gotta plan
We'll push my truck off of Red Top Bridge
Right below the Jackson Dam
Hey, they'll be draggin' the river
Catchin' nothin' but an ol' catfish
They'll be draggin' the river
That'll show that son of a bitch
It's been rainin' for the last two weeks
So the water's up good and high
We'll just wait 'til it's good n' late
So there ain't nobody passin' by
I'll call my cousin
He'll pick us up an' take us to the Greyhound Bus
We'll be standin' in front of that preacher
By the time they're lookin' for us
And they'll be draggin' the river
But they ain't gonna find a thing
They'll be draggin' the river
I'll be wearin' me a diamond ring
Ah, we're gonna show 'em
I know that it might sound crazy
Just a little bit too extreme
But to get some of your sweet lovin'
Baby, I'd do anything
Sooner or later
They'll find my letter sayin' that we're alright
We'll be rockin' at the Red Roof Inn
This time tomorrow night
And they'll be draggin' the river
Sayin', "Lord, what a cryin' shame"
They'll be draggin' the river
We'll be runnin', they'll never see it comin'
They'll be draggin' the river
They'll be draggin' the river
But they ain't gonna find a thing
Sorry about callin' your dad a son of a bitch earlier
Hey, do you think he'll still hire me?
Whoa, that thing's little
The diamond, I mean
There once was a time when I was dead inside
I cussed the Lord for the day I was born
And prayed to the Devil to die
Just when I thought the Devil had won
Someone opened up the door
The King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
[Chorus]
Now, he broke the chains that bound me, and now I'm free
Today I'm right where Mama
Prayed I'd be
I'm down on my knees
Now I believe
What Mama knew for sure
He's King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
Now, if you're in trouble friend, let me tell you what to do
I'll tell you what he's done for me
And I know what he'll do for you
It makes no difference what you've done
You've a friend in the One that I adore
The King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
[Chorus]
He's King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
I don't get along 
With people who aren't kind
I don't get along 
With folks with only money on their minds
And I don't get along with someone 
Who's always trying to tell me what to do
But on and on
I get along with you
Well I don't like
People always tellin' me that I should change
They get simple lives
and they think they've got my life to rearrange
But they don't understand
Exactly what love boils down to
Cause on and on
I get along with you
Well all it takes to please me
Is waking in the morning feeling you by my side
And all I ever needed 
Is knowin' that I'm needed in your life
I may not do 
All the things that other people want me to
But on and on
I'll get along with you.
Yeah on and on
I'll get along with you.
She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you comin' over, I already thought it over
And OK, so now what

And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where

And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
And I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor's said, you know what's on the way?
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out

And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now?
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're goin'?
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
I'll win you over, over and over again
I'm getting closer, closer than I've ever been
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
I'll keep on trying, trying and I'll never give up
I would be lying if I said we were close enough
I gotta get to you 'cause you've sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting
Gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting
Gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
He was sitting there beside me throwing doubles down
When he ordered up his third one he looked around
Then he looked at me
And said, "I do believe
I'll have one more."
He said, "I hate this bar and I hate to drink,
But on second thought, tonight I think, I hate everything."
Then he opened up his billfold and threw a twenty down,
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground.
I picked it up,
He said, "thank you, bud."
I put it in his hand.
He said, "I probably oughta throw this one away
'cause she's the reason I feel this way.
I hate everything."
I hate my job
And I hate my life
And if it weren't for my two kids
I'd hate my ex wife.
I know I should move on and try to start again,
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.
Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, "I hate everything."
Said, "that one bedroom apartment where I get my mail,
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail,
With a swimming pool, and a parking lot view.
Man, it's just great.
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring.
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green.
I hate everything."
I hate my job
And I hate my life
And if it weren't for my two kids
I'd hate my ex wife.
I know I should move on and try to start again,
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.
Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, "I hate everything."
So I pulled out my phone and I called my house.
I said, "Babe, I'm coming home, we're gonna work this out."
I payed for his drinks
And I told him thanks
Thanks for everything.
I'm driving in my car alone
You called me on the telephone
How many times will it take till I'm convinced
That you're using me, I'm just a used-to-be?
It's a lie, I know it's a lie
But I just can't go on dying like this

Can I see you tonight?
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?

I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess
But I just can't go on dying like this

Here I am again, it's four AM
I think I'll play that song again
The one called "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
And I'll wonder where you are tonight
I don't know, I just don't know
But I just can't go on dying like this

Can I see you tonight?
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?

I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess
But I just can't go on dying like this

Lord knows I just can't go on dying like this
There's just a hint of indifference 
In her lack of conversation when we talk. 
And the subject matters change, 
There's no mention of our future now at all. 
She still kisses me each morning, 
But it seems more like a habit than before. 
I know she still loves me, 
But I don't think she likes me anymore. 
She used to laugh at all my jokes, 
But lately I can't seem to make her smile. 
And the last time we made love it was good, 
But God it's been a while. 
She's always there when I get home, 
But she's no longer waiting at the door. 
I know she still loves me, 
But I don't think she likes me anymore. 
'Cause it's just a little colder every time I hold her. 
She's just going through the motions 
From what's left of her devotion; 
And it scares me half to death 
Wonderin' what tomorrow holds in store. 
I know she still loves me, 
But I don't think she likes me anymore. 
Right now I know she loves me, 
But I don't think she likes me anymore.
Sometimes I can't put up with bein' so put down
And all my faith can manage, is the shadow of a frown
My soul's about to break, there's only one escape
I look at you, when the world is full of lies
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes
I look at you, when I lay me down at night
And I want to see a dream come true
I look at you, and I know I've got it all
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you
You know someday's I'm tempted to run away and hide
'Cause I can't miss the bad luck that's fallen from the sky
I'm under some dark cloud, and there's only one way out
I look at you, when the world is full of lies
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes
I look at you, when I lay me down at night
And I want to see a dream come true
I look at you, and I know I've got it all
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you
I look at you, and I know I've got it all
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you
Yes, I know I'm late gettin' home tonight
Can supper wait, I quess I lost my appetite
Yeah you can fix me a drink, oh anything's okay
Oh, by the way I met a friend of yours today
I was workin' on the other side of town
And comin' home I thought I'd stop and have a round
And in this bar I heard someone speak your name
And that's how I met a friend of yours today
I listened for awhile and I could tell
That that stranger there he knew you much to well
And I introduced myself and you should have seen his face
Oh what a shame I met a friend of yours today
Please don't cry woman 'cause it's much too late for tears
Yeah, I'm sorry too 'cause it hurts after all these years
And ain't it sad a love like ours should end this way
And all because I met a friend of yours today
Your out there somewhere and your crying
And I love you though we've never met
Wait there for me, I'll recognize you
Someone lonesome, someone hurtin', someone blue
That'll be you
We'll help each other start all over
A tear for a tear
A shoulder for a shoulder
You'll be someone that's born to lose
'Cause I need someone like me
To hold on too
We'll help each other start all over
A tear for a tear
A shoulder for a shoulder
You'll be someone that's born to lose
'Cause I need someone like me
To hold on too
'Cause I need someone like me
To hold on too
I once had a love, a true and lasting love
But the fool in me came out one night
And with her loving eyes she saw right through my eyes
And she changed the night I stepped across the line
I should have watched that first step
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be
That first step did something to her mind
I watched her slip away a little more every day
And my conscience couldn't live with all that pain
She's growing colder since the day I told her
And the love we had will never be the same
I should have watched that first step
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be
That first step did something to her mind
That first step did something to her mind
Well, I do what my heart says do
And right now it's pointing at you
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing

I went home flying high
I met the girl of my dreams tonight
A wild fire, screamin' inside
I know it's real 'cause my heart don't lie

Well, I do what my heart says do
And right now it's pointing at you
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing

Well, here I am knocking on your door
This old hound wants to talk a little more
The T.V.A. and the hoover dam
Don't turn me on like holding your hand

I do what my heart says do
And right now it's pointing at you
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing

Well, I do what my heart says do
And right now it's pointing at you
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing

Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing
Heart sing
Heart sing
Heart sing
I wasn't fooling around
Everything's true that I said
So take me seriously
Darling, please just take me
I wasn't fooling around
Laugh if you want to
But I wasn't joking
About this love that's so real
Is it surprising
I'm romanticizing
About the way I feel
I wasn't playing around
I'm not a kid anymore
I'm not the clown
That's just here to amuse you
I wasn't fooling around
Laugh if you want to
But I wasn't joking
About this love that's so real
Is it surprising
I'm romanticizing
About the way I feel
I wasn't fooling around
It wasn't like that at all
So take me seriously
Darling, please just take me
I wasn't fooling around
I wasn't fooling around
You say you want to talk it over
Want to try again
But there's no way of workin' out
This love that we're not in
We could talk and talk and accomplish nothin'
We've tried it all before
It's time somebody did some walkin'
And I can see the door
So I'd just as soon go
I'd just as soon say goodbye
There's no reason to prolong
What we should just let die
And I'd just as soon stop
I'd just as soon end the madness
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon go
It's not an easy thing to do
Leavin' seldom ever is
But stayin' just to see us through
Just ain't no way to live
It's hard for you to understand
But we're better off this way
I can't fake it one more night
Or take it one more day
So I'd just as soon go
I'd just as soon say goodbye
There's no reason to prolong
What we should just let die
And I'd just as soon stop
I'd just as soon end the madness
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon go
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon go
Heard somebody speak her name
They said she was still looking fine
I could feel that same old flame
I once felt when she was mine
Always thought that I was missing something
But I found out much too late
There'll never be another who loved me that way
[Chorus]
I'd like to have that one back
I've never known someone so true
And a love that's pure and sweet
Is what a man should never lose
And if my lips had said I'm sorry
She might have stopped right in her tracks
Now I find my poor heart saying
I'd like to have that one back
I can almost see her standing there
Tears rolling down her face
As she packed away her memories
In that old worn out suit case
If I'd only known then what I know now
I'd never open that door
Oh they just don't make hearts like her's any more
[Chorus]
I wouldn't here my poor heart saying
I'd like to have that one back
I wouldn't here my poor heart saying
I'd like to have that one back
You can turn me loose, tear me up and run me down
Cause me shame, drag my name all over town
Makes no difference what you say or what you do
As for me I'll always be lovin' you
[Chorus]
My love for you was not built on shifting sands
I made a promise long ago and it still stands
Go on and do what your heart tells you to
As for me I'll always be lovin' you
You can change your dreams, change your heart
Or change your mind
And just pretend that it all ends with your goodbye
You can walk out and forget the love we knew
As for me I'll always be lovin' you
(Dean Dillon/Glen Martin)
Leavin' me behind is all behind you now
It's plain to see that you're for good over me
You've gotta whole new life ahead of you
You did what you lived to do
And I'm all behind you now
And I'll be behind you always
Should you every be a yesterday
Though it tears me up
To know deep down
I'm all behind you know
You're comin' back
My way will come my way again
I'll never be what I was with you and me
And I don't know who or where your goin' to
But you did what you lived to do
And I'm all behind you now
And I'll be behind you always
Should you every be a yesterday
Though it tears me up
To know deep down
I'm all behind you know
Yeah it tears me up to know deep down
I'm all behind you know
Let's turn the lights down soft and low
And watch the fire embers glow
Let's lock the world outside the door
This is the night we've been waiting for
The moon is shining through the window pane
I hear the echo of a passing train
Taking someone's lover far away
But in your arms is where I wanna stay
Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl
And now that I've found you
I'm never gonna let you go
Let your hair fall across your breast
Show me the warmth of your soft caress
The music's playin' soft and slow
We're driftin' into the afterglow
Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl
And now that I've found you
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
You don't dress up in satin,
You don't wear diamond rings,
But I'm satisfied with you.
You look just like an angel but you haven't got wings,
But I'm satisfied with you.
I'd rather have you just the way that you are
Than change you for somebody new.
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star,
But I'm satisfied with you.
You're not made out of candy
But you're as sweet as you can be
So I'm satisfied with you.
I just can't see no reason why you bother with me,
But I'm satisfied with you.
I often wonder if it's all a mistake;
It's hard to believe that it's true.
But If I'm only dreaming, I sure don't want to wake,
'Cause I'm satisfied with you.
I'm satisfied with you.
So upset
Nervous wreck
I can't believe you said goodbye

Sit and smoke
Cry and joke
About these tears in my eyes

How could you do what you've gone and done to me
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you

A million times
A million lines
And I've bought 'em, every one

You don't care
You rip and tear
Every dream I've counted on

I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars
That I'm alive and you're the way you are
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you

How could you do what you've gone and done to me
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you

I could raise hell
But what the hell
It wouldn't do a bit a good

Pack and leave
My heart agrees
It seems to think that I should

There won't be no more next time doing me wrong
You'll come back this time to find out that I'm gone
But that's what you get
You should expect that from me

That's what I get
I've come to expect it from you
It's 4 a.m. and you're just gettin' in
You're first night out
I won't ask you where you've been
You're so ashamed in you're eyes
Can't beat mine
I've seen that look on me a thousand times
What makes us do the things we do
Heaven only knows
We think we've got a secret
But it always shows
I've taught you how to cheat
You're doin' fine
I've seen that look on me a thousand times
But I still love you
And so I pretend and hope I never see that look again
But if I do I know the fault is mine
I've seen that look on me a thousand times
What makes us do the things we do
Heaven only knows
We think we've got a secret
But it always shows
I've taught you how to cheat
You're doin' fine
I've seen that look on me a thousand times
I've seen that look on me a thousand times
Been in the saddle
Since the sun came up
Roundin' up stray's in
This ole west Texas dust
She's been packin' her things
Since I put coffee on
By sundown she'll be gone
Damn this ole girth
Worn right in two
But a spare length of leather
And I'll make it do
Just when I think I've got
Life by the reins
Home ain't sweet home
On the range
[Chorus]
If heartaches were horses
And hard times were cattle
I'd ride home at sunset
Sittin' tall in the saddle
If heartaches were horses
And hard times were cattle
And she'd say she loved me
And this cowboy way of life
She'd be right beside me
When we rode home tonight
[Chorus]
We both said some things I know we never meant,
And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went.
If I know you, you're probably wonderin' what to do.
You're thinkin' that I'm gone for good, if I know you.
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.
Sometimes I lose my head, say things to break your heart,
Forgettin' if I lost your love, it would tear my world apart.
If I know you, you didn't mean one single thing you said.
Truth be known, you're dyin', cryin', lyin' there in bed.
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.
If I know me, and I know me.
If it's gonna rain I hope it pours
Thunder and lightning
Like never before
'Cause that's how I feel
Here in my heart
If it's gonna rain
Let the storm start
If you're gonna leave go on and go
Don't even look back
When you hit the road
If that's how you feel
About you and me
Now's a good time
So go on and leave
I've never been one for doing
Something half the way
I've loved you with all my heart
But it's all been in vain
It's gonna hurt
Cut to the bone
Break my heart in two
When you move on 
I'm gonna cry a river of tears
It's gonna rain and rain and rain
'Round here for years
I'm gonna cry a river of tears
It's gonna rain
Let the storm start
If it's gonna rain I hope it pours
If you got a Cadillac boy and a 40 room shack boy
A bucket full of money and a tree full of honey
But if you're gettin' no huggin'
No smoochin' or a muggin'
If you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'
If you're ridin' on a gravy train
Instead of walkin' down lovers lane
You can't make hey boy
'Cause you're goin' the wrong way boy
You gotta get a a little honey
It's better than money
If you ain't lovin' 
Then you ain't livin'
If they call you a big man 
'Cause you got a lot of bottled land
If you're kin to the President 
And ya help from the Government
But if you're gettin' no attention
You're better off on the pension
If you ain't lovin 
Then you ain't livin'
If you got a string of long cards 
And you're smokin' them 4 bid cigars 
You ain't so well to do
Unless you get a little coochy-coo
It takes a little bit a smackin'
Or your lifes lackin'
If you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: "We'd be better off,
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."

You could smoke that cigarette,
An' be politically incorrect.
Show off that red 'round your neck:
Not hear a single soul object.
Wouldn't need no lawyers to decide,
Who is wrong and who is right.
No need for big expensive trials:
Brother, we'd just step outside.

If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: "We'd be better off,
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."

Wouldn't have to pay no tax:
Just set a tip jar in the back.
If we ran low, we'd pass the hat:
I bet we'd all be in the black,
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.

And if you're lookin' love:
Someone to heal that broken heart.
Hey, buddy, you'd be in half.
You wouldn't have to go that far.

If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
If you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: "We'd be better off,
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."

Life would be a three-chord song,
And the king would be George Jones,
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.
Ain't love a strain
Ain't it a pain in your heart
Ain't worth the trouble anyhow
I'd like to give it up
I've had enough and I've done my part
But I'm in too deep to pull out now
Good things we've had are going bad
And I don't know why
I'd turn it around if I knew how
I'm pushing aside all of my pride and it's worth a try
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now
[Chorus:]
We need to get our love back on its feet again
We've come to far to let it come to an end
What can I do
I'm in to you up over my heart
And I've tried all that I know how
Doing all I can
I can't stand to see us fall apart
And I'm in too deep to pull out now
[Chorus:]
I can't step aside and let you
Slide right out of my life
It will cause more hurt than the law will allow
I'll get us back on the track
And it will be all right
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now
The years have been so good to you and I my friend 
They brought us to the Autumn wind and left the tears behind 
And who'd have dreamed that love could grow so endlessly 
And you'd have meant so much to me, is it already time? 
And I will always love you so 
We'll hold each other close until it's time to go 
And we believed we had forever on our side 
Is it already time?
And I will always love you so 
We'll hold each other close until it's time to go 
And we believed we had forever on our side 
Is it already time?
And we believed we had forever on our side 
Is it already time?
I thought you and me were something special
Thought you thought that way too
Now I know that this old boy just ain't the 
Best you'll think you'll ever do
[Chorus]
It ain't cool to be crazy about you
It ain't suave or debonair
To let you know I care 
Like I do
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart
(I) Should've known right from the start
I'd end up like a fool
Believe me it ain't cool
All of my friends they tried to tell me
What and what not to do
It took a while for them to sell me
But finally they got through
[Chorus]
Sun shines, clouds rain
Train whistles blow and guitars play
Preachers preach, farmers plow
Wishes go up, and the world goes round
And I love you
It just come natural
It just comes natural
Seasons change, rivers wind
Tumble weeds roll, and the stars shine
Wind howls, dawn breaks
Cowboys riding time slips away
And I love you
It just come natural
It's what I was born to do
Don't have to think it through
Baby, it's so easy loving you
It just come natural
It's what I was born to do
Don't have to think it through
Baby, it's so easy loving you
Fire burns, waves crash
Seeds grow and good things last
Ships sail, dreams fly
Night falls and full moons rise
And I love you
It just come natural
And I love you
It just come natural
It just come natural
It just come natural
Some got a boat they like to float
Some got a story they sugar-coat
Some got a clue and then some don't
It takes all kinds

Some got a beer they like to drink
Some got a thought they like to think
Some got a chain with a few more links
It takes all kinds

That's what makes this world go around
You keep doing your thing, I'm doing mine right now

You've got a song, go on and sing it
Crank it up, rear back and bring it
I've got one, I think I'll swing it
It takes all kinds

Uh-huh, ah yeah

Some wear a backwards baseball cap
If that's you, I'm cool with that
Me, I'm more a cowboy hat
It takes all kinds

That's what makes this world go around
You keep doing your thing, 'cause I'm doing mine right now

You've got a song, go on and sing it
Crank it up, rear back and bring it
I've got one, I think I'll swing it
It takes all kinds

Some like a dip in their bottom lip
They say, it's easier to spit
Me, I like a top lip dip
It takes all kinds

That's what makes this world go around
You keep doing your thing, I'm doing mine right now

Some say it is, some say it ain't
Some say we can, some say we can't
Winners, losers, sinners, saints
It takes all kinds

Some got a boat they like to float
Some got a clue and then some don't
Some got a beer they like to drink
Some got a thought they like to think
Some got a chain with a few more links
It takes all kinds
Full moon Friday night after the game
Stars must have all lined up early that day
I just turned seventeen, she had me by a month
We were young, we were green, to the taste, to the touch
From that very first kiss, it was like we were born for that moment
Caught up in the perfect storm

It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love

We reigned like the king and the queen of the land
Everyone wanted some of what we had then
Yeah, we were the ones they all talked about
Like we were the fire that would never go out

It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love

We knew it was coming, still, it came way too soon
Neither one knew what to say or to do
So, we just let the radio play while we danced
We laughed and we cried like I never have since

It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love

It was love, it was love
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
It's alright I know
Your love will see me through
When the car won't start
The rain won't stop
And all of the bills are due
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
Well the boss man rides me all week long
And it's all that I can take
I work each day till' the sun is gone
And no time for a break
But when I get home you rub my back
And tell me I'm your man
With a little love I get back on track
And do it all over again
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
It's alright I know
Your love will see me through
When the car won't start
The rain won't stop
And all of the bills are due
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
No matter what life throws at me
I've got the upper hand
'Cause nothin' else can set me free
The way your lovin' can
If I lived in the shack out in the woods
And never see me blue
I just throw another log in the old wood stove
And make sweet love to you
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
It's alright I know
Your love will see me through
When the car won't start
The rain won't stop
And all of the bills are due
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
Remember how lonely I told you it would be
Without you here with me
But you just turned and walked away
And now that I've found somebody new
You've changed your tune
You want me back but all I can say
[Chorus]
It's too late now
Just tell me how long did you think
I'd be your fool
And I would sit right here an' wait
For you to make up
Your mind to show up
Well, just turn around
I'm sorry it's too late now
Well didn't I tell you that one of these days
It would be too late
To say you'd made a big mistake
And now you've come back like you've never been gone
Well baby you're wrong
Somebody else has taken your place
[Chorus]
Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell swing
And jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin'
Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in
Jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin'
In jingle bell square
In the frosty air
What a bright time
It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell, time
Is a swell time
To go glidin' in a
one horse sleigh
Giddy-up, jingle horse
Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle
In a jinglin' beat
That's the jingle bell 
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
Far as the curse is found
Far as, far as the curse is found
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love
One look at you
And just look at me
Held under your spell
So helplessly
Yes I'm still your fool
Any fool can see
One look at you
And just look at me
I thought I'd be over you by now
But I guess it's too soon
The truth was so plain to see
Tonight when you walked in the room
I just couldn't control the tears
When I saw you again
My love is still as strong for you
As it's ever been
One look at you
And just look at me
Held under your spell
So helplessly
Yes I'm still your fool
Any fool can see
One look at you
And just look at me
I'm still your fool
Guess I'll always be
One look at you
And just look at me
I gave her that diamond she dreamed of,
And I bought her a home with a view.
I took her to the end of the rainbow,
But all I left her was blue.
Seems I never had time to love her,
And now it seems time just stands still.

I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.

Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.
I thought I was king of the mountain,

But I was only a fool on the hill.
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely

Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.
I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.

Yeah, I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.
I'm seeing you for the last time.
You've been untrue for the last time.
I know that you've been usin' me for a past time.
It's the last time the first time for me.
I found you and that love for the first time.
When I caught you cheatin' me it was my worst time.
I'm seein' you for the last time.
I've been a fool for the last time.
You only strung along with me for a past time.
It's the last time the first time for me.
I found you and that love for the first time.
When I caught you cheatin' me it was my worst time.
I'm seein' you for the last time.
I've been a fool for the last time.
You only strung along with me for a past time.
It's the last time the first time,
The first time it's the last time,
Blues outside my door
I don't even know if it's raining
But I've been here before
And I don't wanna be here again

Ev'ry now and then
voices on the wind
call me back to the first time
far away and clear
you can hear the tear drops
falling for the last in love.

If I let you down
All I can say is "I'm sorry"
Now it's' all over town
So I don't want to hear it from you

Please don't look away it's hard enough to say
This could go on forever
When the night is clear
I can hear the teardrops
Falling for the last in love.

Every now and then
I hear voices on the wind
I may love you always and always
Far away and clear
You can hear the teardrops
Falling for the last in love
Calling for the last in love
She said I don't recall
Seeing you around here
You must be new to this town
Said, I'm just passin through
But, girl from the looks of you I
Could see me settling down
The she smiled and said the invitations open 
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on. 
So I said why don't we take
This matter somewhere else 
And get to know this feeling that's so strong
Lead on
She said, I had a love once
But he just up and left me
I said I bet it broke your heart
I had a love once to but
I acted like a fool 
Oh what I'd give to be back in her arms
Then she smiled and said the invitations open 
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on. 
So I said why don't we take 
This matter somewhere else 
And pick up right where everything went wrong
Lead on
She said I don't recall 
Seeing you around here
You must be new to this town
It's never over 'til it's really over
And someone's left standing behind
It goes without sayin'
It's too late for stayin'
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time
[Chorus:]
I packed up my suitcase and started my pickup
So many times in my mind
It's a hard road to travel
From blacktop to gravel
And the next hill is the hardest to climb
I've got all the answers for most of the questions
And some ain't been easy to find
There's no more erasin'
The things I've been facin'
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time
[Chorus:]
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time
A jukebox introduced us, when the sixties were still young.
"If You've Got the Money, Honey" got my nickels one by one.
I tried to imitate that song.
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.
"Always Late" breaks my heart.
In every song he sang, I played the part.
I heard he was sad, and lived alone.
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.
He played the fair in Dallas one year,
In the cold October rain.
Most folks stayed home and warm,
But he sang just the same.
I caught a chill before I got home.
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.
"Always Late" breaks my heart.
In every song he sang, I played the part.
I heard he was sad, and lived alone.
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.
It don't seem like he was around that long.
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.
Pardon me, you left your tears on the jukebox
And I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry, it's just that I
Noticed you goin' out of your mind
It looks like were two of a kind
[Chorus]
Let's fall to pieces together
Why should we both fall apart
Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms
Alone is much better together
When the worst is still yet to come
So let's share the rest, of the tears that are left
From two hearts that just came undone
Why should we go crazy alone
Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
'Til you smiled with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
At a truck stop in St Angelo
Saw a bill board about this rodeo
This weekend out in El Paso
So I signed up to ride
I drew a bull called "original sin"
Heard he'd killed a couple of men
Figured this was something I could win
'Cause the devil was on my side
I was havin' myself one hell of a ride
But I ended up disqualified
That bull just up and died
Before they blew the whistle
[Chorus]
With those north Texas blues,
Thought I'd paid all my dues
Then those south Texas blues,
Told me "son, you ain't through"
Had the east Texas blues and the west Texas too
I've done all I know to do,
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose,
These ol' Lone Star Blues.
Well I got laid off at Brown and Rue
Then on my way back to cuttin' chute
I lost my wrist watch and my boots
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston
Well there ain't no jobs here workin' cattle
So I got on the part time haulin' gravel
With some outfit from Seattle out here building custom homes
[Chorus]
Well I gassed my truck and I packed my clothes
Turned in my key and I hit the road
I said "cow town's where I'll go,
You never know, I might get lucky!"
Well I got a friend there turning knobs
At a place called Billy Bobs
Said thought he could get me a job there
Workin' as a bouncer
First night on the job was just insane
Some ol' boy got all deranged
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain
To this day, my ears still ring!
[Chorus]
I've done all I know to do,
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose
These ol' Lone Star blues
I own this horse and saddle
And that old Cadillac
This broken down horse trailer
And the clothes that are on my back
Well I know that it ain't a hell of a lot
But it's all that I can show
My wife left me five years ago
In one of those rodeo towns
I can't say that I blame her much
She just wanted to settle down
Oh god how I miss that woman
It hurt so to see her go
If I was smart I woulda stuck by her
But I'm hooked on this rodeo
[Chorus]
And I'm just a lonesome cowboy
I'm a little bit over the hill
I shoulda quit this thing a long time ago
But I guess I never will
So I keep on movin' from show to show
Hopin' to change my luck
My good ol' days are just a memory
But I just can't give it up
There was a time I used to do alright
And bring home my share of the dough
But now I'm losin' out to the younger boys
I guess I must be gettin' slow
But there's one thing you learn from this
You gotta make it on your own
Cause when your on top you've got a million friends
But when your down buddy you're all alone
[Chorus]
My good ol days are just a memory
But I just can't give it up
Those city lights drew you like a magnet
You were attracted to his high-falootin' crowd
I begged you not to go, but you still packed up
I've been expectin' you
Oh, look who's back from town
My old truck could not compare to his Mercedes
Did it humble you when you rode back on that Greyhound
You picked a plastic rose and left a field of daisies
I've been expectin' you
Oh, look who's back from town
[Chorus: x2]
What brings you back to this part of the country
Well let me guess, ol' loverboy let you down
Did he throw you away like his money
I've been expectin' you
Oh, look who's back from town
I've been expectin' you
Oh, look who's back from town
I watched from my window as she slipped from the house
Once again she's leaving, but Lord, she's not to blame
This morning a memory phoned her and he's a habit she can't break
So 'til she returns, I'll wait for her,
Looking out my window through the pain 
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away
And it hurts to know she's hung up on some guy from yesterday
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything
But I love her, so I'll wait for her, 
Looking out my window through the pain 
I'll pick up the pieces when he lets her down again
With love and understanding, I'll give her reasons this time to stay
And I'll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will change
And I won't be left lonely, 
Looking out my window through the pain 
Yes, the devil drove the taxi that carried her away
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything
But Lord I love her, so I'll wait for her, 
Looking out my window through the pain
Well I was rulin' the roost had all the chicks to myself
And suddenly it happened that funny little feelin' I felt
Well I tried to outrun it but it finally caught up with me
Tell me how can I run from somethin' that I can't see 
Oh that a little bitty teeny weeny thing called the love bug
Nobody's ever seen it but it's got the whole world shook up
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they called the love bug
Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style
But I lost that race by a good old country mile
Well I was walkin' around with my head held way up high
And it fooled me hit me really took me by surprise
Oh that a little bitty teeny weeny thing...
Oh that a little bitty teeny weeny thing...
Well it's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they called the love bug
When things get bad at home, you don't feel like being alone,
And you find yourself inclined to look around.
For the feelings we once shared are just no longer there,
And love comes from the other side of town.
Where love means just an hour with your stand in,
And not an empty house where love just has been.
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,
Now love comes from the other side of town.
The life I'm livin' now just don't seem right somehow,
But it's the best way to get by that I've found.
There's no love left at home, we're both just hangin' on,
And love comes from the other side of town.
Where love means just an hour with your stand in,
And not an empty house where love just has been.
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,
Now love comes from the other side of town.
Love comes from the other side of town
Love is everything
It's a whole lot more than going to the store for a wedding ring
It's kissin' and a huggin' but it's also the kicking and the cussing thing
I've been told

Love is everything
It's a smile on your face on a cold winter day at the thought of spring
It's getting up at night for the cry of a little bitty baby thing
And it's growing old

Love is everything
It's those fires that daddy stoked those nights to keep you warm
It's the hell your mama went through the day you were born
And it's a thunderstorm

Love is everything
Oh, it's going off to war, it's the back and forth on a front porch swing
It's the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen
And it's you and me

Love is everything
It's looking out for everybody else but number one
And it's all that really matters when all's said and done
And the race is run

Love is everything
It's a rose on a stone, it's the words in a song that the choir sings
It's the tears of goodbye and the place that you fly to, to get your wings
Yeah love's the king
Love is everything
Love is everything
I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waitin' for the worst

And he said

Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen

When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him

I said

Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen

Last night I dreamed I'd died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side, I heard these words again

And they said
Girl you had one of those days
Seem like they been going around
You are a long way from being where you want to be.
When the world isn't going your way
Or whatever bad luck is getting you down.
Honey I will be right here for you with open arms,
You can run to me.
Baby, love's gonna make it, love's gonna make it alright (alright, alright)
Baby, love's gonna make it, love's gonna make it alright,
Tonight, tonight, tonight.
We go out and paint the town
We can dance your cares away.
We can watch them all fall out on the floor.
And if you want to we can close it down.
We can leave whenever you say
I'll chase you down the hallway.
Watch the sun come up behind our bedroom door.
Baby, love's gonna make it, love's gonna make it alright (alright, alright)
Baby, love's gonna make it, love's gonna make it alright,
Tonight, tonight, tonight.
That's the good thing girl about me and you.
There ain't nothing that lovin' can't get us through
Baby, love's gonna make it, love's gonna make it alright (alright, alright)
Baby, love's gonna make it, love's gonna make it alright
Baby, love's gonna make it, love's gonna make it alright (alright, alright)
Baby, love's gonna make it, love's gonna make it alright,
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Well I was ruling the roost, had all the chicks to myself. 
And suddenly it happened, that funny little feeling I felt. 
Well I tried to outrun it, but it finally caught up with me. 
Tell me how can I run from something that I can't see? 
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug. 
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up. 
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug. 
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug. 
Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style, 
But I lost that race by a good old country mile. 
Well I was walking all around with my head held way up high, 
And it fooled me, hit me, really took me by surprise. 
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug. 
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up. 
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug. 
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug. 
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up. 
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug. 
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug. 
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug. 
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug. 
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up. 
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug. 
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug. 
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.
There's a secret that I know about the lady that I love so
And I'm the only one she's shown her secret to
She's gentle and she's kind
She's proper and refine
But she lets down more than her hair
Alone in our room
[Chorus]
Cause she's more than a lady
And there's a fire that burns behind those eyes
She's more than a lady
And every night when we lay down
And she slips off her satin gown
Oh, she proves she's a lover in disguise
She's a lover in disguise
When we go out somewhere
The men may stop and stare
But they see she's a lady
So they leave her alone
She's more than she seems
And in their wildest dreams
They could never dream of what it's like to take her home
[Chorus]
She's a lover in disguise
She's a lover in disguise
She's a lover in disguise
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the "blue hoo's," 
since my sweetie said "Good Bye"
Seems I don't know what to "Do Hoo"
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's 
 
Got the feeling called the "blue hoo's," 
since my sweetie said "Good Bye"
Seems I don't know what to "Do Hoo"
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
i got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's
[chorus]
Play me a dancer, a holder-hander, or honky-tonker,
Pull-her-up-closer, slow romancer,
Make her fall in love with me song.
The room is swimmin' with pretty women,
But how's a fella supposed to get close to 'em?
The band is rockin', the joint is jumpin,
Mr. guitar man let me tell you somethin'
[chorus]
I see a redhead, I see a brunette,
And there's a blonde I love I don't even know yet.
I'm going crazy, you got to save me.
I need a hugger and I don't mean maybe.
[chorus]
Play me a dancer, a holder-hander, or honky-tonker,
Pull-her-up-closer, get-next-to-her,sweet-enough-to-kiss-her,
Just-a-little-softer-so-she-can-hear-me-whisper, slow romancer,
Make her fall in love with me song.
Ther'es a soft rain tappin' on your window
There's a cool breeze blowin' off the bay
And a warm flame dancin' with our shadows
To music playin' far away
I never meant to stay an hour
I thought that I was passing through
Another town along the highway
I never meant to fall for you
[Chorus]
But I can't speak for you Maria
I only know the way I feel
When I sleep with you, Maria
There's nothing left for dreams to steal
On a Bible by the mirror
The only treasures that we hold
The only secrets that we're keepin'
A watch, a chain, a cross of gold
[Chorus]
When the sunlight brings the mornin'
I can't tell you what I'll do
But I've a mind to take you with me
And I've got heart to stay with you
[Chorus]
When I sleep with you, Maria
There's nothin' left for dreams to steal
We said goodbye
In marina del rey
"I had a good time"
Was the last thing I heard her say
As I walked away
And on this plane back to Tennessee
My mind comes across her memory
And yesterday
In Marina Del Rey
[Chorus]
On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket
That we laid down on and loved the world away
In Marina Del Rey
And as we looked into each other's eyes
We found our body's lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina Del Rey
Like the ocean tides
High and lows
Love sometimes comes and goes away
In Marina Del Rey
And as this plane is touching down
Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed
In Marina Del Rey
[Chorus]
She sparkles, she dazzles, she lights up the room 
We walk together to a table for two 
Every man stares but her eyes are only for me 
We take to the dance floor, she squeezes my hand 
I can't believe just how lucky I am 
[Chorus]
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory 
You're still dancing with me 
And I'm holding you once again 
Meanwhile 
We move to the end of a beautiful night 
Tender the kisses, soft candle light 
She draws the curtains, and slowly we climb up the stairs 
And reach for each other the passion begins 
We fall together as lovers and then,
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory 
You're still lying with me
And I'm holding you once again 
I try and I try, the Lord knows I do 
But each time my heart beats back to you 
Meanwhile I'll go on living my life now 
I'll find a way somehow 
Oh but, meanwhile back in the back of my memory
You'll always be with me
But I'll never hold you again
Meanwhile.
I had no reason for shopping this season
But I hung your stocking today
It makes me feel better
Though we're not together
You'll always be in my heart
Merry Christmas, wherever you are
Since it was Christmas
I thought you might call
Or have you stopped thinkin' about me at all
It'd be a perfect white Christmas
A storybook picture
If I could just share it with you
Though you're not here with me
I've got your memories
They keep me goin' sweetheart
Merry Christmas wherever you are
Though you're not here with me
I've got your memories
You'll always be in my heart
Merry Christmas wherever you are
Tag:
Merry Christmas wherever you are
Well I woke up this mornin'
Looked outdoors
I can tell my milk cow
I can tell by the way she lows
If you see my milk cow
Please drive her on home
Cause I ain't had no milk and butter
Since that cows been gone
Well you gotta treat me right honey
Day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down upon your knees and pray
Cause you're gonna need me
You're gonna need my help someday
Lord you're gonna be sorry
You, you treated me this a way
Aw, now take it away boys
Sail on, sail on, sail on little gal, sail on
Sail on, sail on, sail on little gal, sail on
You're gonna keep right on sailing
Till you lose your happy home
Well good evening
Don't that sun look good going down
I said well good evening
Don't that sun look good going down
Don't that ol' army cot look lonely
When your lover ain't no place around
Well I tried everything baby
To get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell you
What I'm gonna do
I'm gonna stop my cryin'
Gonna leave you alone
And if you don't think I'm leavin' big momma
Just count the days I'm gone
You ain't gonna see me
You ain't gonna see my sweet face no more
Lord you gonna be wondering honey
Where in this world I've gone
Milk cow blues
Nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue.
They never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used.
But someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul.
They got away with murder down on music row.
The almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame
Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang 
(oh, you tell them Alan).
They all say not guilty, but the evidence will show
That murder was committed down on music row.
For the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play,
But drums and rock 'n roll guitars are mixed up in your face.
Old Hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio
Since they committed murder down on music row.
They thought no one would miss it, once it was dead and gone
They said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating songs (I'll still buy'em)
Well there ain't no justice in it and the hard facts are cold
Murder's been committed down on music row.
Oh, the steel guitars no longer cry and you can't hear fiddles play
With drums and rock 'n roll guitars mixed right up in your face
Why, the Hag, he wouldn't have a chance on today's radio
Since they committed murder down on music row
Why, they even tell the Possum to pack up and go back home
There's been an awful murder down on music row.
Well honey don't you worry I don't need no bar room queens
Though I'll admit she sure knows how to fill a pair of jeans
And I'll admit now darlin' she's sure showing me her stuff
But honey it ain't nearly enough
'Cause I ain't never seen her
Patch a pair of raged britches
Stretch a paycheck 'till it reaches
Scratch my back right where it itches
And I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do
My heart won't wander very far from you
Now honey you know I honor all the hard times with been through
I never could have made it with anyone but you
And I think I know when a lady's really really tough
And she don't show me nearly enough
'Cause I ain't never seen her
Stay up all night with a baby
Calm me down when I get crazy
Fix me grits and red-eye gravy
And I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do
My heart won't wander very far from you
No I ain't never seen her
Make a six room house a castle
Teach young'uns how to wrestle
Straighten out my fishin' tackle
I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do
My heart won't wander very far from you
No I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do
My heart won't wander very far from you
When you see a shooting star in the night
When you hear the warm wind whisper through the pines
I want you to know
[Chorus]
It'll be me and my infinite love for you
It's just like I promised you under heaven above
It will live on long after we kiss goodbye
Forever by your side
My infinite love
When you think someone is callin' out your name
When you feel that kind of feelin' you can't explain
Now you will know
[Chorus]
I want you to know
[Chorus]
My infinite love
My infinite love
My life's been grand
I been a hand at livin' it up all the way
I've had good times and bad times and hard times and done time
But life's been a blessing every day
My life's been grand
You know I'd write home and tell 'em 
But they wouldn't believe how good my luck's been
And if it ended today I've been all the way
My life's been grand
My life's been grand
(Repeat)
You're the only one and only
My heart's beating for
I love you, need I say more
Now and ever, we'll be together
Of that you can be sure
I love you, need I say more
I don't know just what it is
That you're needing to hear me say
The way that I'm feeling is more than mere words can describe
All this discussion could never
Do justice to something so heavenly-made
I'd rather tell you
With touches how I feel inside
Let me hold you, let me show you
What true love's all about
In these arms of mine I know you will find
You won't do without anymore
I'll love you forever need I say more
I don't know just what it is
That you're needing to hear me say
The way that I'm feeling is more than mere words can describe
All this discussion could never
Do justice to something so heavenly-made
I'd rather tell you With touches how I feel inside
Let me hold you, let me show you
What true love's all about
In these arms of mine I know you will find
You won't do without anymore
I'll love you forever need I say more
I'll love you forever need I say more
You've been out again tonight 
With the girls out on the town
But in those magic neon lights
I know exactly what you found
What about your home?
And the man who loves you so
Is it worth the thrill you feel down on neon row
If you're lonely then your easy
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose
And lonely women are in season
A one night stand's an all night lose
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies
Are always putting on a show
But in the morning putting on coffee
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before
To neon row
Girl I can't hold you back
Not one day longer
If my love ain't strong enough
To keep you home
Just start the fire
To burn the bridges
And maybe some night will lead in the magic light
Down on neon row
If you're lonely then your easy
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose
And lonely women are in season
A one night stand's an all night lose
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies
Are always putting on a show
But in the morning putting on coffee
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before
To neon row
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before
To neon row
I've been to all the ol' familiar places
At least a hundred of times since you've been gone
I've seen a lot of ol' familiar faces
But again tonight I'm goin' home alone
My heart won't let me move on one but you
My mind keeps tellin' me that just won't do
My arms keep reachin' out for someone new
But my heart won't let me love no one but you
I've told myself a million times it's over
You've gotta face the truth and let her go
Just when I think I've got it all together
Your memory walks around in side my soul
My heart won't let me move on one but you
My mind keeps tellin' me that just won't do
My arms keep reachin' out for someone new
But my heart won't let me love no one but you
As the sun sets and you let go
And my dreams go that way too
And I watch the silhouettes flow out of clear view
We can do this thing right
Fix what went wrong
Really make this work
Turn around real slow
Walk straight back to me
Nobody has to get hurt
We can learn from my mistakes now
I don't ask you to forget 
But forgive my good intentions and where they went
We can do this thing right
Fix what went wrong
Really make this work
Turn around real slow
Walk straight back to me
Nobody has to get hurt
Leon Dixon leaves his Christmas lights up all year 'round
It's somethin' different about our town
We've often wondered why he never takes 'em down
But Leon leaves his Christmas lights up all year 'round
There's a big bright noel flashin' off and on
In the yard where the children play the whole year long
We've all gotten used to it year by year
Now it's kinda gotten to be a part of things 'round here
[Chorus]
Peace on earth, Good will to men
Christmas time is here again
Can it be all that wrong
To feel like Christmas all year long
Leon got sick, it's been back awhile
Short on luck and money, but he still wore that smile
And nobody could stand to see him do without
So we all drove over to see if we could help out
Yeah, the noel flashed on and the bills stayed paid
I felt so warm as we drove away
I had never seen Christmas spelled so clear
As when I saw ?LEON? flashin' in my rear view mirror
[Chorus]
O Christmas tree 
Thy leaves are so unchanging 
Not only green when summer's here
But also when 'tis cold and drear
O Christmas tree 
Thy leaves are so unchanging
O Christmas tree 
Much pleasure thou can't give me
How often has the Christmas tree
Afforded me the greatest glee
O Christmas tree 
O Christmas tree 
How richly God has decked thee
Thou bidst us true and faithful be
And trust in God unchangingly.
O Christmas tree
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord
Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to God
Glory in the highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus, to Thee be
All glory given
Son of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord
If you leave me
I won't miss you
And I won't ever take you back
Girl your memory
Won't ever haunt me
Cause I don't love you
Now if you'll buy that

I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free

I don't worship
The ground you walk on
I never have and that's a fact
I won't follow or try to find you
Cause I don't love you
Now if you'll buy that

I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free

I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free

Yeah if you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye
Oh no one else could take her place in my life
Oh we had something good
So tell me why she would
Go and make me cry 
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye
I remember how she'd hold me
And say she'd stay forever true
Back when the future looked so rosy
But tonight it's lookin' mighty blue
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye
Oh no one else could take her place in my life
Oh we had something good
So tell me why she would
Go and make me cry 
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye
Don't know what I didn't give her
That she gets from someone new
I only know how much I miss her
And wish my heart was only broke in two
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye
Oh no one else could take her place in my life
Oh we had something good 
So tell me why she would 
Go and make me cry
Oh me, oh my
Why did she go and make me cry
Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye
I woke up this mornin',
Peaked out my door:
It was rainin', cold an' grey.
It's my one day off: I was gonna play golf.
There goes the plans that I made.
Oh, but you won't hear me complain.
An' oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.
When you're in my arms, I've got sunshine,
An' the sky's always blue.
Couldn't ask for better weather,
To do what I do:
Oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.
So let's go grab a blanket,
An' a hot cup of coffee,
And sit out on the front porch and swing.
That look in your eyes is what's on my mind:
We don't have to say anything.
Let's just listen to that old tin roof sing.
An' oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.
When you're in my arms, I've got sunshine,
An' the sky's always blue.
Couldn't ask for better weather,
To do what I do:
Oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.
Oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.
For lovin' you.
Tricycles, Bicycles
Candy canes and candlelight
Tryin' to stay awake all night
To catch a glimpse of Santa's reindeer
Mama bakin', sister makin'
Angels in the fallin' snow
Now it seems so long ago
I wish they all were here
[Chorus]
We'd have an old time Christmas
An old time Christmas
Just like the ones from yesterday
We'd leave the world behind us
Let the spirit find us
And have an old time Christmas
For old times sake
Friends singin', bells ringin'
Snowman standing in the yard
It's a living Christmas card
Captured in our hearts forever
Friends scatter, it's won't matter
The magic never melts away
It only takes a Christmas Day
To make it reappear
[Chorus]
So leave the world behind you
Let the spirit find you
And have an old time Christmas
For old times sake
Well, love can be an uphill climb
I'm gonna meet a lot of resistance
It takes every ounce of strength we've got
If we're gonna go the distance
We can get discouraged and lose our courage
Worrying 'bout the daily grind
But life's a journey, no need to hurry
It's one day at a time
[Chorus]
One foot in front of the other
Take one step then take another
Keep on walkin', we're headed in the right direction
Puttin' one foot in front of the other
Little by little gets a whole lot further
Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other
What's down the road we can't say
And the road behind don't matter
But every mile along the way
Is just another mile together
Unconcerned about the twists and turns
We're takin' it nice and slow
Safe and sound, covering ground
Steady as she goes
[Chorus]
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow takes care of itself
We'll just keep on keepin' on
'Cause we ain't stumbled yet
One foot in front of the other
Take one step and then take another
Just a-walkin' and a-talkin' and a-movin' in the same direction
Just puttin' one foot in front of the other
Little by little gets a whole lot further
Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other
Well, just a-hittin' our stride
One foot in front of the other
I'm not yours, and, baby, you're not mine
We've got something and it sure is fine
Let's take our love one night at a time

There's one thing that we both agree
I like you, and, baby, you like me
Let's take our love one night at a time

All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right one night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right one night at a time

Oh, I think about you all day long
It feels so good, it can't be wrong
I got my fingers crossed that this goes on and on

Tomorrow, well, that's another day
Come on, baby; now, what do you say?
Let's take our love one night at a time

Last night I had a dream, dreamt I had it all I had it all
I had one truck, one car
One boat, one guitar
But all these things wouldn't get me too far
If I didn't have one of you
I work hard every day to bring home all my pay
I got one house, one yard
One dog who likes to bark
We'd be cold, living the dark if I didn't have one of you
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete
[Chorus]
This is what I have, you have it all
I got one heart, one love
One dream I'm dreaming of
Wouldn't have known what to give it all to
If I didn't have one of you
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete
[Chorus]
Some people say I'm one of those guys the blessings of life over looked.
Sometimes I feel like the tattered, torn pages of some old paperback book.
All the places I've played and the money I made, I've still got nothin' to show.
And the only thing I have left in the whole wide world is you.
[Chorus]
I gave it all I had every night for all these years,
Pourin' out my soul till it was gone.
I spread myself so thin that I'm just barely hangin' on.
But tonight I'm with you, you can carry me through; just love me.
Cause the only thing I have left in the whole wide world is you.
You put your whole life into something you love,
But you never get that one big break
That'll take you out of the backstreet bar and put you on center stage
But a million tears and million beers have just about washed me up.
[Chorus]
The only thing I have left is you.
Lady I know your out there somewhere
Like me your feeling lost
Maybe right now we both need each other
But our paths may never cross
People like us never find each other
Love is our greatest loss
Baby I know you are out there some where
But our paths may never cross
We're to people that should be together
'Cause we're lonely at the very same time
But there's a million to many good reasons
Why your love can never be mine
Maybe this song was written for you
Listen, don't turn it off
I wish you could learn it
And come sing it with me
But our paths may never cross
I wish you could learn it
And come sing it with me
But our paths may never cross
I've always heard people say it
But I guess I never fully understood it
I thought that they meant, you'd be easy to forget
But it's drivin' me crazy
[Chorus]
Out of sight out of mind
You opened my eyes, and now I can see
What you mean to me, I was so blind
Out of sight out of mind
You know it hurt when you left me
But I thought life would go on without you
That was easier said, can't get you outta my head
I don't know if I'll make it
[Chorus]
I was so blind
Out of sight out of mind
Let me be your male-man
And I'll always come though
There's no denying'
Come rain or shine
I'll deliver my love to you
I do things by the letter
You can put your stamp on me
Cause there ain't nobody better
For a special delivery
[Chorus]
Like the pony express
And the wild wild West
I'll ride hard all night long
And I can saddle up fast
Get ya there first class
Long before the dawn
You know your male's gonna get to you
Come snow, rain, sleet, or hail
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight
Do you right overnight male
I know your heart is fragile
So I'll handle it with care
There ain't no doubt
I know love's route
So baby let me take you there
I'll bring you cards and flowers
But I know just what you need
Just give me 24 hours
Satisfaction guaranteed
[Chorus]
You know your male's gonna get to you
Come snow, rain, sleet, or hail
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight
Do ya right overnight male
Yeah I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight
Do ya right overnight male
I go anywhere that ol' wind blows
Down a blacktop road, anytime
No strings attached, no ties to tie me down
So why hang around, when I can fly
[Chorus:]
I'm free, free to do as I please
Free to choose, free to be
Just plain me, just plain fine
I'm here then I'm there
Not a care in the world
What a cure for the soul, peace of mind
I go anywhere that ol' wind blows
Down a blacktop road anytime
No strings attached, no ties to tie me down
So why hang around, when I can fly
I don't dare slow down for anything
What tomorrow brings suits me fine
And I don't dare look back on yesterday
It's a throw away better left behind
[Chorus]
I go anywhere that ol' wind blows
Down a blacktop road, anytime
No strings attached, no ties to tie me down
So why hang around, when I can fly
So why hang around, when I can fly
My first sip made me gag
And I thought I was gonna blow beets
But I took another and pretty soon brother
Sour mash started tasting sweet
Made me feel brave and strong
Bulletproof, like I could do no wrong
But I found out before too long
What I should've known
You can learn to love anything
Even a bird in a cage will sing a song
Even it's wrong
Even if it kills you in the end
You can learn to love anything
Trade your heart and soul for a ball and chain
Anything can bring you pleasure, even pain
Pick your poison
Poison
Pick your poison
Ruby lips hid a razor tongue
And heart, blue as glacier ice
I was warned, but I was willing
To ignore everybody's advice
The more I gave, the more she took
She walked away without a second look
Just one more page from that great big book
On how
You can learn to love anything
Even a bird in a cage will sing a song
Even if it's wrong
Even if it kills you in the end
You can learn to love anything
Trade your heart and soul for a ball and chain
Anything can bring you pleasure, even pain
You can learn to love anything
A prison wall, a ball and chain
Anything can bring you pleasure, even pain
Pick your poison
Poison
(You can learn)
Pick your poison
Pick your poison
(You can learn)
Pick your poison
Poison
Poison
Pick your poison
Pick your poison
I know the end is near
I've seen the warning signs
Been preparin' myself
Layin' in supplies
I bought a case of Jack
A boxed-set of Merle
I'm gettin' ready
Ready for the end of the world
I'm gettin' ready for the end to come
That final hour it all comes undone
An' she drops the bomb
An' says he ain't my girl
I'm gettin' ready
Ready for the end of the world
My neon shelter waits
Where I can go to hide
While the memories burn
I'll be safe inside
With the honky-tonk few
Bracin' for the worst
I'm gettin' ready
Ready for the end of the world.
I'm gettin' ready for the end to come
That final hour it all comes undone
An' she drops the bomb
An' says he ain't my girl
I'm gettin' ready
Ready for the end of the world
Yeah, I'll be ready
Ready for the end of the world
I'd rather be home,
But I make my livin' on the go
Big silver eagle spreads her wings
And drops us at another show
I think about holdin' my baby tonight
As I listen to the big wheels roll
Three days into a six week tour,
Gettin' in the rhythm of the road
We pick and sing,
Say "goodnight" then we'll be flyin'
My world's a chain of one-night-stands
Strung together by the center line
I don't know where I'll wake up tomorrow,
But I can't let the tempo slow
Every town is just another beat,
Livin' in the rhythm of the road
The rhythm of the road's got a mind of its own
If you find it it'll drive you insane
Like the clackity-clack of a railroad track
I'm rattlin' like an old freight train
Towns are flashin' by, the folks are wavin' "hi"
They all start to look the same
Gotta stop for a minute, be glad I'm in it
Remember just why I came
Those highway signs, Lord, they keep me on the move
I think about givin' it up sometimes,
And gettin' in a diff'ren groove
But I just let the days slide by,
Get goin' with the flow
A four beat's the only time I keep,
Livin' in the rhythm of the road
A four beat's the only time I keep,
Livin' in the rhythm of the road
[Repeats]
Right or wrong, I'll always love you
Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with the same old regret
All along I knew I'd lose you
Though I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you.
Hey baby won't you take a little ride with me
Have a look around, see what we could see
I've got the paddle, I've got the boat
Come on baby I know she'll float

We'll go rollin' on the river of love
We'll go rollin' on the river of love

Drift away from all these city lights
Might rock a little bit, so hold on tight
Let's get carried away with the gentle flow
Might get caught up in it's undertow

We'll go rollin' on the river of love
Let's go rollin' on the river of love

I got a little ukulele let me sing you a song
I got a stream of kisses 'bout ten miles long
Dancing on the water in the moonlight beach
Sparking down through the sea of dreams

We'll go rollin' on the river of love
Let's go rollin' on the river of love

Yeah we'll go rollin' on the river of love
Let's go rollin' on the river of love

River of love
River of love
River of love
Rollin' on the river of love

Let's go rollin' on the river of love
Rock, paper, scissors
Sittin' on the table in the kitchen
That's all he's got left since she got gone
It goes hand-in-hand with the memory of doing her wrong

She slipped that ring off her finger
Slapped that ink on a goodbye note
She cut his face outta every picture
Lost his last name but won the game of

Rock, paper, scissors
Bouncing on the table as he pounds it double-fisted
He's blowing up her phone but it ain't gonna change a thing
'Cause there ain't gonna be no best two out of three

She slipped that ring off her finger
Slapped that ink on a goodbye note
She cut his face outta every picture
Lost his last name but won the game

When she found him passed out on couch
With lipstick on his cheek
There was nothing left but take a breath
And one, two, three

She slipped that ring off her finger
Slapped that ink on a goodbye note
She cut his face outta every picture
Lost his last name but won the game of

Rock, paper, scissors
Sittin' on the table in the kitchen, oh yeah
The first time I saw you
You were waitin' tables at the corner diner
I said to myself
Never seen a woman look any finer
From that moment on
I was stone cold gone
You would be forever in my mind
Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
It was San Francisco
Silly suits and white ties by the bay
You appeared with your papa
Tears were rollin' down your mama's face
Everyone was happy
Showered by well wishers as we drove away
Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
I'm living but dying
I'm laughing but crying
Somebody tell me it will be alright
I bought it for your birthday
God you looked so lovely in that dress
I took you to a party
Or was it to a night club I forget
Been twenty years and counting
I'm drowning in your love a little more each day
Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
As far as all my friends can tell 
I took her leavin' well - that's kinda right
'Cause when I'm out with them 
I don't let her memory rule the night
For the most part I'm okay
But I still miss her in a round about way
Around about the time that midnight rolls around
That's around about the time my tears start falling down
'Cause she's not around
I come unwound and my heart breaks 
Yeah, I still miss her in a round about way
 
I no longer sit alone for hours by the phone
Wishin' she would call 
And just the other day 
I took her smilin' face down off my wall
I've come a long long way
But I still miss her in a round about way
Around about the time that midnight rolls around
That's around about the time my tears start falling down 
'Cause she's not around
I come unwound and my heart breaks
Yeah, I still miss her in a round about way
Yeah, I still miss her in a round about way
You know Dasher and Dancer, and Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid, and Donner and Blitzen,
But do you recall, the most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve,
Santa came to say:
"Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee,
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,
You'll go down in history.

If there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it
Cause I swear out there ain't where you ought to be
So catch a ride, catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me
Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line

Did you ever meet somebody that likes all the same things you do?
Somebody who can make you or break you, any time they want to
I met her at a red light, love at first sight, can this be true?
She's good for me and she told me I was good for her too
Now, I don't wannna jump into anything
I've been tryin' to use some self restraint
But man it's amazin'
She's the same kind of crazy as me
It's gettin' hard to use a ladder 'cause I keep climbing down, just to kiss her
And if she's outta my sight for a minute or two, I start to miss her
We stay all tangled up in each other's arms, and it's so nice
She talks in her sleep, but she always gets my name right
If there's anything at all that's wrong with her
It's somethin' that I can't see
Ain't no doubt about it
She's the same kind of crazy as me
Wild, wild nights, chasin' each other through the moonlight
My, my, my I finally got somethin' right
'Cause every little off-beat move she makes
Suits me to a tee
Ain't no doubt about it
She's the same kind of crazy as me
Wild, wild nights, chasin' each other through the moonlight
My, my, my I finally got somethin' right
'Cause every little off-beat move she makes
Just suits me to a tee
Ain't no doubt about it
She's the same kind of crazy as me
You know what I'm sayin'
She's the same kind of crazy as me.
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not put I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list and checkin' it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when your sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not put I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
With little tin horns
And little toy drums
Rutty toot, toots and rummy tum, tum
Santa Claus is coming to town
With curly head dogs to cuddle and hug
Elephants, ropes, and kitty card too
Santa Claus is coming to town
The kids and girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee
There gonna fill the toy land 
All around with Christmas trees
So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not put I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
Christmas is always my favorite time of year
Sleighbell's ringin' jingle lingin'
Christmas time is near
Can't wait to build a snowman
And play outside all day
Nothing could be better
I gotta write a letter
Santa's on his way
[Chorus]
Christmas time is always
A special time of year
A time for joy and happiness
And lots of Christmas cheer
Can't wait to decorate the tree
That we brought home today
Nothin' could be better
I gotta write a letter
Santa's on his way
[Chorus]
So have a very Merry Christmas
And a jolly happy day
Nothin' could be better
I gotta write a letter
Santa's on his way
Santa's on his way
Santa's on his way
What makes something you can't have always look so good
Why'd do something out of reach seem so fine
What makes you thrill me more than any girl I know
I guess it's just because you can't be mine
Why can't I be contented with what belongs to me
And be satisfied with what's already mine
What makes a stolen moment such a precious thing
I guess it's just because you can't be mine
What makes me always want a woman I can't have
Why the someone else's silver always shine
My patience rises every time you come around
And I guess it's just because you can't be mine
Why can't I be contented with what belongs to me
And be satisfied with what's already mine
What makes a stolen moment such a precious thing
I guess it's just because you can't be mine
Well, I learned how to walk and I learned how to run in Bakersfield
Should've done time over things I'd done in Bakersfield
I tasted my first taste of romance in Bakersfield
I learned how to fight and I learned how to dance in Bakersfield
Dancin' on Beer Can Hill
Overlookin' Bakersfield
Remembering my first thrill
Dancin' on Beer Can Hill
I made part of my livin' in a honky tonk bar in Bakersfield
Picked a little cotton and a lotta guitar in Bakersfield
Well you couldn't do better but you won't do bad in Bakersfield
Slow dancin' out here is sort of a fad in Bakersfield
I drank a lot of beer since I was a kid in Bakersfield
Did a little time over things I did in Bakersfield
Ten years later made me of the year in Bakersfield
And I'm duckin' and dodgin' and dancin' out here in Bakersfield
In the town of Louisville
They got a man called Big Bad Bill
I want to tell you he sure was tough
Yeah, all folks scared to death
When he walked by they held their breath
He was a mighty man sure enough
Now Bill took himself a wife
Now he's a different guy
Big Bad Bill is sweet William now
Married life has changed him somehow
Yet he's not the man they used to fear
Now the people call him, sweet Papa Willie dear
Stronger than Sampson I'll declare
And he's bound in mama comb his hair
Big Bad Bill don't fight anymore
Wash his dishes and he might sweep the floor
Yeah, he used to spend his evenings a lookin' for a fight
But now he gotta see his Mama every night
'Cause Big Bad Bill is sweet William now
Yeah, he used to spend his evenings a lookin' for a fight
But now he gotta see his Mama every night
I'm tired of this dirty old city 
And tired of too much work 
And never enough play
And I'm tired of these dirty old sidewalks 
Think I'll walk off my steady job today
Turn me loose, set me free 
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your so-called Social Security
Big city turn me loose and set me free
Been working everyday since I was twenty
Haven't got a thing to show 
For anything I've done
There's folks who never work and they've got plenty
Think it's time some guys like me had some fun, so
Turn me loose, set me free 
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement 
And your so-called Social Security
Big city turn me loose and set me free
Hey, big city, turn me loose and set me free
Billy never made the football team
'Cause Billy's size was small
But Billy's brother was a mighty lad
And played a lot of high school ball
And Billy's daddy never favored him
He catered to the bigger guys
But later on in a bigger way
Billy overcame his size
The years flew by and Billy grew
But he never got very big
We called him shorty but he never got mad
He was always good for a dig
And we paid no mind when he fell in line
And left with the other guys
And the Sargent laughed at his skinny frame
But Billy overcame his size
Billy overcame his size
Yeah, Billy overcame his size
Later on in a bigger way
Bill overcame his size
Billy's brother made a football star
And the biggest man in town
And the scholarship that kept him home
Never seemed to bring him down
But on the other hand his brother Bill
Put pride in his daddy's eyes
When he died to save those other men
Billy overcame his size
Billy overcame his size
Billy overcame his size
When he died to save those other men
Billy overcame his size
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if, if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when all those blue heartaches start hurting
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
Christmas, I'll have a blue Christmas
Blues, stay away from me
Blues, why don't you let me be?
Don't know why you keep on haunting me

Love was never meant for me
True love was never meant for me
Seems somehow we never can agree

Life is full of misery
Dreams are like a memory
Bringing back your love that used to be

Tears so many I can't see
Years don't mean a thing to me
Time goes by, still I can't be free
Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
I know you plan to bring electric trains
Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
That's the only song we hear him sing
Santa, please remember Bobby's lonely
The closest neighbour's farm is quite a ways
And the country school don't have no children Bobby's size
And I'd like to give him something he can raise
And Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
I know you plan to bring electric trains
But, Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
And that's the only song we hear him sing
Butch and Susie won't be here for Christmas
And he won't see his cousins now till spring
If we can find a playmate he can play with
Santa, that'll be all you have to bring
And Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
I know you plan to bring electric trains
But, Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
That's the only song we hear him sing
My brain is cloudy, my soul is upside down
Yeah, my brain is cloudy, my soul is upside down
When I get that low down feeling
I know the blues must be some place around
Well, you got to treat me right day by day
Get out your little prayer book, get on upon your knees and pray
'Cause you're gonna need, you're gonna need my help someday
Yeah, you're goin' to be sorry, oh, you treat me this way
Well, good evenin', don't that sun look good goin' down
Well, good evenin', don't that sun look good goin' down
Don't your home look lonesome when your lover ain't around
Now I've tried everything, baby, to get along with you
And now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna stop cryin', gonna leave you alone
If you don't think I'm leavin', you can count the days I'm going to
You're gonna need, you're gonna need my help someday
Yeah, you're goin' to be sorry, oh, you treat me this way
I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who I am
But they won't let my secret go untold
I paid the debt I owed them, but they're still not satisfied
Now I'm a branded man out in the cold
When they let me out of prison, I held my head up high
Determined I would rise above the shame
But no matter where I'm living, the black mark follows me
I'm branded with a number on my name
I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who I am
But they won't let my secret go untold
I paid the debt I owed them, but they're still not satisfied
Now I'm a branded man out in the cold
If I live to be a hundred, I guess I'll never clear my name
'Cause everybody knows I've been in jai
No matter where I'm living, I've got to tell them where I've been
Or they'll send me back to prison if I fail
I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who I am
But they won't let my secret go untold
I paid the debt I owed them, but they're still not satisfied
Now I'm a branded man out in the cold
Now I'm a branded man out in the cold
Bartender come over here
I want to buy the next round of beer
Boys name your poison, don't nobody pass
We're all brother of a bottle an' glass.
The happiest moment that I've ever known
Was the day that she told me she would be my own
But the bluest moment that ever could be
When she said she loved someone much better than me.
Bartender come over here
I want to buy the next round of beer
Boys name your poison, don't nobody pass
We're all brother of a bottle an' glass.
Well, I once had a buddy as fine as could be
We trusted each other completely you see
Well, then I betrayed him just like any wretch
No one but a woman could make you do that.
Bartender come over here
I want to buy the next round of beer
Boys name your poison, don't nobody pass
We're all brother of a bottle an' glass.
When God made man I guess this made him sad
For now they're all good and none are all bad
Then he made woman to cheat and deceive
There's been hell ever since the snake tempted Eve.
Bartender come over here
I want to buy the next round of beer
Boys name your poison, don't nobody pass
We're all brother of a bottle an' glass
C.C.Waterback, one tequila sunrise
One's for my achin' head, the other's for my bloodshot eyes
And last night I let it all hang out, I guess that's how my head got sore
C.C. Waterback, I can't stand the pain no more
Last night we got invited to a party at the Jones' place
For fun and games and booze and things
I guess, I must've drank a case
But that lady of mine, she drank warm red wine
'Til she couldn't even find the door
She wound up in ol' Jones' bed
And I wound up on the floor, hang, I give you
C.C. Waterback, one tequila sunrise
One's for my achin' head the other's for my bloodshot eyes
Last night we let it all hang out, I guess that's how our heads got sore
C.C. Waterback, I can't stand the pain no more
And I said, C.C. Waterback, one tequila sunrise
One's for my achin' head the other's for my bloodshot eyes
Last night I let it all hang out, I guess that's how my head got sore
I said, C.C. Waterback, I can't stand the pain no more
My driftin' memory goes back to the spring of '43,
When I was just a child in momma's arms.
My daddy plowed the ground and promised someday we would leave
This run-down mortgaged Oklahoma farm.
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my momma
That he'd finally saved enough to go.
California was his dream, a paradise, for he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so.
California cotton fields,
Where labor camps were filled with weary men with broken dreams.
California cotton fields,
As close to wealth as daddy ever came.
Nearly everything we had was sold or left behind,
From my daddy's plow to the soup that momma canned.
Some folks came to say farewell or see what all we had to sell
Carolyn, let me tell you what I heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city, bright in the nighttime like day
There they say he met with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb, dripped with honey
And somethin' about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm, and not alone
Yes, Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
I believe a man will do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home 
Yes Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home
One night when the moon was bright on the moonlit bay
That is where I found my little Cherokee maid
The memory of the that night of love, is lingering yet
And I know I never will forget
My little Cherokee maiden, I love her so
And though we're far apart
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her
For anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies
We'll ride to paradise
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee maiden and me
My little Cherokee maiden, I love her so
And though we're far apart
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her
For anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies
We'll ride to paradise
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee maiden and me
Seems like every November
When the weather gets bad
I start to remember
All the good times we had
The long nights get longer
I Wish an friend would come by
The forecast is zero
And the chill factors high
You know the chill factors higher
On a cold windy day
But there's no wind this morning
And no wind on the way
There's a snowstorm inside me
With record high wind
And I'm colder this morning
Than I've ever been
Seems like every November
When the weather gets bad
I start to remember
The good love we had
And the long nights get longer
Wish an old friend would drop by
The forecast is zero
And the chill factors high
When I was young man
I worked on my own
You had the big chore
Of makin' a home
Now that I'm the keeper
Of all that was yours
I'm head of the family
And I'm boss of the chores
Living without you
Is a chore on its own
I understand what all you did
Now that you are gone
Sometimes it sprinkles
Sometimes it bores
When you're head of the family
And you're boss of the chores
When I lost you, darlin'
The kids lost a mom
Now it's me and the children
And there's work to be done
Look out for the babies
And I scrub all the floors
Cause I'm head of the family
And I'm boss of the chores
Living without you
Is a chore on its own
I understand what all you did
Now that you are gone
Sometimes it sprinkles
Sometimes it bores
When you're head of the family
And you're boss of the chores
Sometimes it sprinkles
And sometimes it bores
When you're head of the family
And you're boss of the chores
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down
Said yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Ah, and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty heck into that district court
Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read murder in the first degree
I hollered Lawdy Lawdy, have a mercy on me
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
There's a place where Mother Nature's got it all together
She knows just when to let wild flowers bloom
Somehow she always seems to know exactly what she's doin'
And the Lord saw fit to furnish elbow room
Have you ever been down to Colorado?
I spend a lot of time there in my mind
And if God doesn't live in Colorado
I'll bet that's where He spends most of His time
I'd love to be there watching, early in the morning
The sun comes up and crowns the mountain king
If by chance you dare to be there high upon the mountain
I swear that you can hear the angels sing
Have you ever been down to Colorado?
I spend a lot of time there in my mind
And if God doesn't live in Colorado
I'll bet that's where He spends most of His time

And I'm crazy for loving you

Cause you're in the sky before the sun goes down
And we waste another lonely afternoon
Crazy me

Well, you can cry me a river

And just to prove you do

Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp
Sister played the ringing tambourine
And mama couldn't hear our pretty music
But she read our lips and helped the family sing
That little band was all a part of living
And our only means of living at the time
And it wasn't like no normal family combo
'Cause Daddy Frank the guitar man was blind
Frank and Mama counted on each other
Their one and only weakness made them strong
Mama did the driving for the family
And Frank made a living with his song
Home was just a camp along the highway
Pickup bed is where we bedded down
Don't ever once remember going hungry
But I remember Mama cooking on the ground
Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp
Sister played the ringing tambourine
Mama couldn't hear the pretty music
But she read our lips and helped the family sing

And our only means of living at the time
And it wasn't like no normal family combo
'Cause Daddy Frank the guitar man was blind
Don't remember how they got acquainted
I can't recall just how it came to be
There had to be some special help from someone
And blessed be the one who let it be
Fever caused my Mama's loss of hearing
Daddy Frank was born without his sight
And Mama needed someone she could lean on
And I believe the guitar man was right
Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp
Sister played the ringing tambourine
Mama couldn't hear our pretty music

I used to live with the whiskey
And the good time and the ladies of the night
Then the whiskey took control
Left me waltzing with the witches in my mind
But imaginary bottles won't be everywhere
To haunt me like before
'Cos I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore
So, go to sleep my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore
It don't matter where you came from
All I know is that you gave me back my pride
You reached out your hand and saved a man
Who strayed about as far as he could slide
And you probably came from heaven
Who else could've sent you but the Lord
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore
So, go to sleep my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me

I'm a kid with a guitar
Trying to play ?, when they ask
Where does your style come from?
I know what you mean
'Cause I learned to sing
Listening to blue, yodel number one
We love Hank and Lefty
Bob Wills, Ernest Tubb, and Johnny Cash
But if we had to pin point
The start of who we are
Or who we go by
The Django and Jimmie
Has Mississippi
A young singing brakeman
A jazz playing gypsy
Might not have been
A Merle or a Willie
If not for a Django and Jimmie
Through the twenties and thirties
Jimmie sang his way to the top
In spite of those old TB blues
Django was a star
He burned up a guitar
With just two good fingers to use
You can't turn back time
Or put more sand in the glass
But sometimes at night
I close my eyes and go back
The Django and Jimmie
Has Mississippi
A young singing brakeman
A jazz playing gypsy
Might not have been
A Merle or a Willie
If not for a Django and Jimmie
It might not have been
A Merle or a Willie
If not for a Django and Jimmie

When you used to take the lawn mower
Oh, I tried to get to Amirillo
But man, it was to far with a ten horse power
Well, you had, you had a red Buick though didn't you
For two week I had a red Buick
And found out later it was gold
Well, hmm as long as you don't start doing that duck

I'm just driftwood
Drifting with the winds that blow across the sky
I can't always be here with you, babe
I'm just driftwood drifting by
Our lives came together
Somehow we came to mingle for a while
Like two colors of the rainbow
We blended well together for a while
But I won't ever anchor down

I'm just driftwood
And I think it's time I drifted on aways

She can sparkle like the moonlight on the river
At times her words can cut you like a knife
She's got a way of bein' tough and tender
But she'll always be the highlight of my life
Sometimes she's hotter than the thirty first of August
And colder than a February morn
But Heaven knows I'm always more than willin'
To hold that ever changing woman in my arms
There's days she almost loves me down to nothin'
And turns around and hates my very soul
So I always wear a T-shirt and a jacket
Just in case that woman's runnin' hot to cold

Then colder than a February morn

Everytime the dream is born
And every fool has a rainbow that only he can see
Every fool has a rainbow and the rule replies to me

Every fool has a rainbow and the rule replies to me
Everybody sings the blues sometimes
And everybody knows the tune
And everybody knows the way I'm feelin'
'Cause everybody's had the blues
A lonely song, someone is gone, a story old as time
Love, hate, or want and wait till misery fills your mind

There's a family Bible on the table
Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings, one by one

I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me

Now this old world
Of ours is full of trouble
And this old world would also better be
If we'd found more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing rock of ages, cleft for me

I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me

Rock of ages

Who'll buy my wheat
Who'll buy my corn
To feed my babies when they're born
Seeds and dirt
A prayer for rain
That I can use
I work the land
I watch the sky
I talk to God and wonder why
But it's the only like I know
These farmer's blues
I see the seasons come and go
Sendin' rain, fire, and snow
I'm at the mercy of it all
This life I choose
Sometimes I hang my head and cry
When that evenin' train goes by
Wish it could take me far away
These farmer's blues
The tractor's old
The fence is down
Put on my suit and go to town
Ask for a loan
And I know well
They might refuse
Back at home
Still by my side
The one I love
With worried eyes
Waits for me
To love away
These farmer's blues
I see the seasons come and go
Sendin' rain, fire, and snow
I'm at the mercy of it all
This life I choose
Sometimes I hang my head and cry
When that evenin' train goes by
Wish it could take me far away
These farmer's blues
(Yodel)
I hear people talkin' bad 
About the way we have to live here in this country
Harpin' on the wars we fight 
And gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be
I don't mind 'em switchin' sides 
And standin' up for things that they believe in
When they're runnin' down my country, man 
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me 
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down the way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
When you're runnin' down my country, hoss
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
I read about some squirrelly guy
Who claims he just don't believe in fightin'
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on bein' free
They love our milk an' honey
But they preach about some other way of livin'
When they're runnin' down our country, hoss
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down the way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
When you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down the way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
When you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
When you're runnin' down our country, hoss
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
I hear that train a comin', it's comin' 'round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm locked in Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on
And I hear that train a-rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me "Son
Always be a good boy don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that lonesome whistle I hang my head and I cry
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars
Well, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But I hear that train a-rollin' and that's what tortures me
Well, if they freed me from this prison and that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it over a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to be
And let that train keep rollin' and roll my blues away
It's a big house on a hilltop fine carpets on the floor
Expensive polished marble are the steps up to the door
Vines are climbin' up to the roof top as if there's something they'd like to hide
People call it a Fool's Castle and I'm the fool that lives inside
The girl is gone that warmed the castle now it's dark the flame has died
It's a big house on a hilltop without love and without pride
People call it a Fool's Castle and I'm the fool that lives inside
She used to live here I thought she was lucky
She had what most girls only dream of
I gave her diamonds silk and satin I gave her everything but love
And with my giving I gave her nothing she wanted only to be by my side
Yes they call it a Fool's Castle and I'm the fool that lives inside
The girl is gone that warmed the castle
I live the kinda life most men only dream of
I make my livin' writin' songs and singin' them
But I'm forty-one years old and I ain't got no place to go
When it's over
So I hide my age and make the stage and
Try to kick the footlights out again
I throw my old guitar across the stage and
Then my bassman takes the ball
And the crowd goes nearly wild to see
My guitar nearly fall
After twenty years of pickin' we're still alive
And kickin' and kickin' down the wall
Tonight we'll kick the footlights out
And walk away without a curtain call
Tonight we'll kick the footlights out again
And try to hide the mood we're really in
Might not put on our old Instamatic grin
Tonight we'll kick the footlights out again
I live the kinda life most men only dream of
And I make my livin' writin' songs and singin' them
But I'm fortysome years old and I ain't got no place to go
When it's over
So I hide my age and make the stage and
Try to kick the footlights out again
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops flowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops flowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts oh Lordy how they did love
Swore to be true to each other true as the stars above
He was her man he was doing her wrong
Frankie went down to the corner just for a bucket of beer
She says Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here
He's my man he was doing me wrong
I don't want cause you no trouble I ain't gonna tell you no lie
I saw your lover an hour ago with a gal named Nellie Bligh
He is your man and he's doing you wrong
Frankie looked over in transom she saw to her surprise
There on the cab sat Johnny making love to Nellie Blie
He is my man and he's doing me wrong
Frankie drew back to her kimono she took out a little 44
Rutty too too three times she shot right through that hardwood door
She shot her man he was doing her wrong
Bring out the rubber tied buggy bring out the rubber tied hack
I'm taking my man to the graveyard but I ain't gonna bring him back
Lord he was my man and he's done me wrong
Bring out a thousand policemen bring 'em around today
And locked me down in the dungeon cell and throw that key away
I shot my man he was doing me wrong
Frankie she said to the warden what are they going to do
The warden he said to Frankie it's a electric chair for you
Cause you shot your man he was doing you wrong
This story has no moral this story has no end
This story just goes to show that there ain't no good in man
He was her man and he's done her wrong
From the sun years of the Fifties and the birth of rock and roll
Millions screamed to see him do his thing
Elvis touched the life of every ear that heard him
And they couldn't help but listen when he sang
It's a long way from Memphis to that mansion in the sky
But he kept his faith in Jesus all along
It's a long way from Graceland across Jordan to the Promised Land
But Jesus finally came to lead him home
Oh, the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now
And never sayin' what they mean
So, they while away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
La, de, da, da, da, da, da, da
La, de, da, da, da, da, de
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Lord, they make one another cry
Break their hearts and never say goodbye
Cross their hearts and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
And neither one would ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the ways it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
La, de, da, da, da, da, da, da
La, de, da, da, da, da, de
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
People walkin' up to you
They're singin' 'Glory Hallelujah'
And they're tryin' to sock it to you
In the name of the Lord
They gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and cheat your fate
Further more to hell with hate
Come on and get on board
La, de, da, da, da, da, da, da
La, de, da, da, da, da, de
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Look around and tell me what you see
What's happenin' to you and me
God, grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
'Cause you've given up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity
And you don't give a da, da, da, da, da
La, de, da, da, da, da, da, da
La, de, da, da, da, da, de
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
I've seen how you tremble whenever he walks through your mind
Stirring up memories that cloud up your eyes
Where the light of our love ought to shine
I know that he hurt you and hurt you so bad he must have been going insane
Now I finally learned how to hold you together when somebody mentions his name
He's just a ghost story so don't let him scare you he's not really there like he seems
And tonight when I hold you I'll hold you so close
I'll love him right out of your dreams
I'm sure that he's called you and told you that our love can't last
But don't you believe him cause honey he's wrong he's never been right in the past
So don't let him haunt you and tell you those lies he just can't admit that you're free
The next time he calls you just hand me the phone and see if he'll say that to me
He's just a ghost story
He's just a ghost story
In old Padres Nadres Old Mexico 
Once in my travel I happened to go
I met Maria and we fell in love 
It seemed like heaven came down from above
Dark skin and dark eyes and dark wavy hair 
All kept me spellbound as love filled the air
I held her tightly then to my surpise
She whispered soft words with tears in her eyes
Go home go home your people would not understand
Go home go home go back to your own homeland
With gentle persuasion I changed her mind 
I said they'd love her and treat her so kind
So we went together to my old hometown
I wanted to show my old friends what I'd found
But hate made my sweet dream a nightmare
One day I came home and she was not there
A note on the table tore my world apart
My old friends has been there and told my sweetheart
Go home go home your place is not with this man
Go home go home go back to your own homeland
I'm throwin' a goin' away party
A party for a dream of mine
So put me somewhere off in a corner
With a glass and bottle of your party wine
Don't worry it won't be a loud party
I feel too low to get too high
It's just a sad goin' away party
For a dream I'm telling goodbye
I'm throwin' a goin' away party
A party for a dream of mine
Nobody's coming but a heartache
And some tears will drop in now most anytime
Don't worry it won't be a loud party
Dreams don't make noise when they die
And so since it's a goin' away party
Go away and let me cry
Hey, it's just a sad goin' away party
For a dream I'm tellin' goodbye, goodbye
Rollin' with the flow
Going where the lonely go
Anywhere the lights are low
Going where the lonely go
Making up things to do
Not running in all directions, trying to find you
I'm just rollin' with the flow
Going where the lonely go
And I've got to keep goin'
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around
I've got to keep goin'
Traveling down this lonesome road
And I'll be rollin' with the flow
Goin' where the lonely go
I've got to keep goin'
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around
I've got to keep goin'
Traveling down this lonesome road
And I'll be rollin' with the flow
Goin' where the lonely go
Well you took my love for granted and I gave it all willingly
But seeing you with someone else was the breaking point for me
I know I'm goin' crazy I can feel it comin' on
The signs're all around me and I know I'll soon be gone
Gone crazy I may be hard to find gone crazy somewhere out of my mind
But there'll be laughter all around me when they come and take me away
And in case you see me leavin' oh you can bet I've gone to stay
I know you're gonna miss me when you find I've gone insane
But I got the right to lose my mind if I can't stand the pain
Gone crazy I may be hard to find gone crazy somewhere out of my mind
Well I'm longing to ride on a freight train 
Put a slouch hat down low on my ears
I'm yearning to leave this old town 
On the flight and loose all my troubles and cares
In this day of airplanes and highways 
Hey the slow way is sometimes the best
I'm longing to ride on a freight train 
And be a good old American guest
Yes I want to live on the land that 
I've loved and I've labored for
And spend a few days headed west
I'm longing to ride on a freight train 
And be a good old American guest
Well the pressures of life they got to me 
And they got down and deep in my soul
I'm tired of the rat-race 
want to go back to the slow pace
And hear a fast train rattle and roll
I want to live out my days like a hobo 
And take myself that long-needed rest
Hey, hey I'm longing to ride on a freight train
And be a good old American guest
Yes I want to live on the land that 
I've loved and I've labored for
And spend a few days headed west
I'm longing to ride on a freight train 
And be a good old American guest
Oh, yes I'm longing to ride on a freight train 
And be a good old American guest
Now, I won't think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
And good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today
And I won't talk about believin'
If you won't beg me to stay
I wanna live just for the moment
And everything is going my way
And I won't think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
The good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today
I'm not gonna save any money
I'm gonna spend every dime I can
And I'll buy you everything with money can buy
While the good times are here at hand
And I won't think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
Well, the good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today
I just remember something that I forgot to do
The bedroom door needs paintin' and the walls are fadin' too
Angie's bike needs fixin', that all takes time, you see
And I know I'm not fooling you, goodbye comes hard for me

So I'll just check for things once more and look in every room
I must have dropped my comb somewhere
And a man must stay well groomed
It seems I have the right to stay but I know you don't agree
When it's goodbye to all our love, goodbye comes hard for me

Goodbye comes hard for me and I hoped you'd grab my sleeve
I thought that you might change your mind and ask me not to leave
My face is wet, I've cried I guess, I loved you now and free
When it's goodbye to all our love, goodbye comes hard for me

My face is wet, I've cried I guess
Grandma's maiden name was Zona Villines
There's ninety years to tell about in a few short lines
Born in Newton County down in Arkansas
Then in nineteen-one she married Grandpa
We laid her soul to rest one Sunday mornin'
And everybody knew she'd done her part
Don't get set to hear no hidden family legend
Just a song about the life of Grandma Harp
Just think about the times that she lived through
And think about the changing world she saw
Now, somehow, she reared a decent family out of poverty
And for seventy years she loved the same old Grandpa
To me, her passing brought a closing chapter
To a way of life that I love within my heart
I just mean to say I think we owe her something special
If just a song about the life of Grandma Harp

In a quaint caravan
There's a lady they call, 'the gypsy'
She can look in thefuture
And drive away all your fears
Everything will come right
If you'll only believe the gypsy
She could tell at a glance
That my heart was so full of tears
She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday
She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday
If I only had one arm to hold you 
Well better yet if I had none at all
Then I wouldn't have two arms that ache 
For you there'd be one less mem'ry to recall
If I only had one ear to listen to 
The lies that you told to me
Then I more closely resemble 
The half a man that you've made of me
If I only had one leg to stand on 
Then how much how much truer picture you'd see
'Cause then I more closely resemble 
The half a man that you've made of me
Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end
Heartache number three Was when you called me
And said that you was coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
Now I've got heartaches by the number
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end
Well, since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
Its down at the end of lonely street
At heartbreak hotel.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.
And although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
Do cry away their gloom.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.
Well, the bell hops tears keep flowin',
And the desk clerks dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.
You make me so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.
Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
And you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel.
That psycho, that psychologist
Asked me about my drinking ways
Every question that he asked me
All related back on to my childhood days
But if the truth was known
I never took the drinking long, long as she was mine
But when she left me I went to hell
Heaven was a drink of wine
That good doctor said, "Look at all
These ink spots and tell me what you see
Could I help it if they all look like
Big ol' broken hearts to me?"
Ah, my friends in Cane'll tell you
Ol' Haggard ain't a drinking kind
But when she left me I went to hell
And heaven was a drink of wine
Get back, get back
Get on back and leave me alone
Can't you see that you can't help
A man that's just for gone
Hey, good doctor, I've got something
You can't find in my mind
When she left me I went to hell
Heaven was a drink of wine
Hey, good doctor
Heaven was a drink of wine
All aboard America here comes the freedom train
All aboard America here comes the freedom train
The freedom train is rolling down two hundred years of track
Two hundred years of glory never to turn back
The train is called America your ticket is a dream
That left the torture of freedom for all the world to see
She left the station in Lexington in 1776
And rode to Philadelphia where the liberty bell was fixed
George Washington was the engineer John Adams shoveled coal
And Franklin punched the tickets Tom Jefferson added soul
All aboard America here comes the freedom train
She rode to New Orleans the battle of 1812
With old Hickory at the throttle she drove the British out
The freedom train's a fine train the toppest of world it seemed
Her whistle blows for the liberty with a mighty head of steam
Wheels of fortune sweaty Pittsburgh rolled across the Mississippi
From Texas to Missouri to one real exciting trip
Then bang of track was broken smashed by a cannonball
That blew in great divided will the nation stand or fall
All aboard America here comes the freedom train
Will Annistage stepped into the cab and the wheels began to roll
Freedom train must never stop Republic never fall
To the bloody fields of Gettysburg the tear show in his eyes
She drove the train with fury the freedom train survive
Again the train rode westward to California shores
To the deserts and prairies even stronger than before
From Atlantic to Pacific she drove the rail with pride
She traveled a track to glory with the good Lord on her side
All aboard America here comes the freedom train
There's much more to this story like Wilson and Roosevelt
They left the train to Truman who stoked it mighty well
Then old Dwight D Eisenhower or LBJ we sing
Two brothers known as Kennedy and Martin Luther King
And still the train rolls forward over history's rugged trail
Straightening by the journey and the land beneath her rail
And you and I roll along and stroke the freedom fire
For we stand to all Americans hold old honor can't be hired
All aboard America here comes the freedom train
It's four a.m. in New York City, three a.m. in Dallas
The night is still early here in Frisco
Market street's still going, the same old shows are showing
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
They say it's raining in Chicago, but it's cold and clear in Denver
Been windy all night long here in Frisco
Trolley cars are clinging, the big Bay Town's swinging
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
The way I feel tonight, I won't be staying long
But when I leave, I'll leave my heart just like in the famous song
Trolley cars are clinging, the big Bay Town's swinging
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco
High on a hilltop overlooking a city
I can see the bright lights as they gleam
And somewhere you're dancing in some dingy bar room
And the lure of the gay life takes the place of our dream
High on a hilltop my heart cries, Oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we'll pray
I can vision a rounder with a line so smooth
And a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger cause you're silly with booze
And high on a hilltop I see a devil in you
Hobo Bill-why
Riding on that eastbound freight train speeding through the night
Hobo Bill a railroad bum was fighting for his life
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold
Hobo Bill
No warm lights flickered round him no blankets there to hold
Nothing but the howling wind and the driving rain so cold
When he heard a whistle blowing in a dreamy kind of way
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay
Hobo Bill
Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcar door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
While the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride
It was early in the morning when they raised the hobo's head
The smile still lingered on his face but Hobo Bill was dead
There was no mother's longing to soothe his weary soul
For he was just a railroad bum who died out in the cold
I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance and my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory
Is the hardest part
For a hero's strength
Is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star I can go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

I will search the world
I will face its harms
Till I find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms
This old smoke filled bar is something I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied
And I just called to let you know where I'll be living
It's not much but I feel welcome here inside
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a bar stool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me any time you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing time
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy
And I've got everything it takes to lose my mind
And in here, the atmosphere's just right for heartaches
And thanks to you I'm always here till closing time
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a bar stool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me any time you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing time
I'm always here at home till closing time
Holding things together
Ain't no easy thing to do
When it comes to raisin' children
It's a job - meant for two
Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together 
With you gone.
Today was Angie's birthday
I guess it slipped your mind
I tried twice to call you
But no answer either time
But the postman brought a present
I mailed some days ago
I just signed it love from mama
So Angie wouldn't know.
Holding things together
Ain't no easy thing to do
When it comes to raisin' children
It's a job - meant for two
Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together 
With you gone.
Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together
With you gone.
It may be down the south in Alabama
Or maybe just a little old one horse town
It could be on the back streets of Chicago
But if it's home it's still the greatest place around
Home's where the kid grows up and spends his younger days
Home is where I long to be no matter how far away
There may be an old sweetheart still there waitin'
Can't tell I might even find a few old friends
I know my mom and dad would like to see me
And know I want so much to go back home again
Home's where the kid grows up and spends his younger days
Home is where I long to be no matter how far away
It may be down the south in Alabama
Or maybe just a little old one horse town
I'm a honky-tonk nighttime man
I can't stand no light
I'm a honky-tonk nighttime man
I can't stand no light
I get my rest in the daytime
I make my running 'round at night
I had the blues this morning
Had the blues all day today
Had the blues this morning
I had the blues all day today
But when the sun goes down
I'm gonna tuck my blues away, away that's what I said
Roy, tuck away
I mean my heart starts beatin'
And the sun starts sinking low
Lord, my heart starts beatin'
When that sun starts sinking low
When the shadows fall
I know it's time to go, go, Norm!
I'm a honky-tonk nighttime man
I can't stand no light
I'm a honky-tonk nighttime man
I can't stand no light
I get my rest in the daytime
I do my running 'round, 'round at night, all round
[ Both ]
For years we both have lived on pride dear
[ Merle ]
And we agreed that love is gone
[ Bonnie ]
Why oh why do we keep trying
[ Both ]
A house without love is not a home
The simple things have gone forever we wanted wealth to call our own
[ Merle ]
We slaved to gain a worthless treasure
[ Both ]
A house without love is not a home
No matter where our footsteps wander I know we'll both be all alone
[ Merle ]
With the pride that came between us
[ Both ]
A house without love is not a home
The simple things have gone forever...
A canvas-covered cabin in a crowded labour camp 
Stand out in this memory I revived
'Cause my daddy raised a family there, with two hard-working hands 
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes
He dreamed of something better, and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just to young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted 
But it wasn't 'cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage, as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't 'cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Oh, I still recall my mama's hungry eyes
That old white haired judge in Dallas
Didn't pay my story no mind
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
I'm bringin' in a load of time
They caught me on a caper that I planned for days
And proved everything I done
I'm on my way to Huntsville
But I'm looking for a chance to run
My hands don't fit no choppin' pile
And cotton was never my beg
They better keep both eyes on me
Or they're gonna lose old Hag
Hey there ain't so far to Mexico
There I can find my way
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay
They got me chain and leg irons
I guess they got a good excuse
They know I'm gonna run the first chance
I get cause they never gonna cut me loose
And I don't care if they shoot me down
I'll never be free again
I've got two long life turns to do
Both runnin' in the end
Hey there ain't so far to Mexico
There I can find my way
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay
Well there's been sayin' goin' round I began to think it's true
It's awful hard to love someone when they don't care about you
Once I had a lovin' gal the sweetest little thing in town
But now she's gone and left me she done turn me down
But I ain't got nobody nobody cares for me
And I'm so sad and lonely won't somebody come and take chance with me
I'll sing you sweet love songs honey all of the time
If you'll only be the pretty mama of mine
Cause I ain't got nobody nobody cares for me
[ guitar - dixieland - fiddle ]
Yeah I ain't got nobody...
I've had good luck and bad luck 
And no luck, it's true
But I always get lucky with you
I've been turned on and turned down 
When the bars close up too
But I always get lucky with you
I keep two strikes
Against me, most all of the time
And when it's down to a phone call 
I'm minus the dime
There's been good days and bad days 
But when the day is all through
Hey, I'll always get lucky with you
I keep two strikes
Against me, most all of the time
And when it's down to a phone call 
I'm minus the dime
There's been good days and bad days 
But when the day is all through
Hey, I'll always get lucky with you
Now, play it beautifully
Play the bridge for me, Norm
Put me back on a roll
I came close, so close to failure
I came close to living alone
I know the kids still love me and their mama
But I came so close to losing my home
I felt small enough to drown in each teardrop
But big enough to admit I was wrong
When I think of what I've done the cheer runs through me
Cause I came so close to losing my home
I felt small enough to drown in each teardrop
But big enough to admit I was wrong
When I think of what I've done the cheer runs through me
Cause I came so close to losing my home
I came so close to losing my home
It's a way of mine to say just what I'm thinking
And to do the things I really want to do
And you want to change the part of me I'm proud of
So I can't be myself, when I'm with you
Oh, you never liked the clothes I wear on Sunday
Just because I don't believe the way you do
But I believe the Lord knows I'm unhappy
'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with you
I can't be myself and be what pleases you
And down deep inside, I don't believe that you'd want me to
And it's not my way to take so long deciding
That I can't be myself, when I'm with you
I can't be myself and be what pleases you
And down deep inside, I don't believe you'd want me to
And it's not my style to take so long deciding
That I can't be myself, when I'm with you
No, I can't be myself, when I'm with you
Oh, I was born a good boy, my mama loved me so
And she gave me every chance she could to make my life a gold
But I fell in with the wrong crowd and the wrong crowd led me on
But I could have gone right just as easy as I went wrong
I went to the places where sin just waits for you
And I fell in with the wrong crowd like sinners always do
Now here I sit in prison just waiting for the day
When they'll lead me through that door and burn my life away
Oh, mama please forgive me, the shame is all my own
For I could have gone right just as easy as I went wrong
Oh, mama please forgive me, the shame is all my own
For I could have gone right just as easy as I went wrong
I come home and I sat down by the door 
I just sat and dream my lonely life away
I just can't stand a thought that I won't see you anymore
I guess I die ten thousand times a day
If that soulful life comes to its end 
I ceased to live the night you went away
If you walk through that door then I'll start to live again
I guess I die ten thousand times a day
I pick up each thing you used to touch
I call to mine each tender word you say
If I've hurt you it's just because I love you much too much
I guess I die ten thousand times a day
I don't want to sober up tonight
I don't want to act like things are alright
And I don't want to change just to make you think I'm happy
That's my right, I don't want to sober up tonight
I want to keep my mind a little hazy
I don't care if all my friends think I'm crazy
The way I treat myself I might be a little crazy
But that's alright, I don't want to sober up tonight
I'm here to drown another day of misery
I'm in here to spend one night without a mem'ry
And the way I'm drinking now there won't be any memory
But it's alright, I don't want to sober up tonight
I don't want to sober up tonight
I don't want to act like things are alright
I don't want to change just to make you think I'm happy
That's alright, I don't want to sober up tonight
I fall to pieces each time I see you again
I fall to pieces how can I be just your friend
You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget pretend we've never met
And I've tried oh I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces
I fall to pieces each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces time only adds to the flame
You tell me to find someone to love
Someone who'll love me too the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces you walk by and I fall to pieces
Memory is a gift a man can't live without
And in times we can't control the things we think about
So sometimes I still remember you in every way
But for a little while I forget you every day
Seems like I forget you just in time
Cause it's always just before I lose my mind
I wake up every morning hurting the same old way
But for a little while I forget you every day
Seems like I forget you every day
And it's always just before I lose my mind
I wake up every morning hurting the same old way
But for a little while I forget you every day
We met downtown in the barroom
Both of us needing a friend
And you brought me home to your doorstep
And it was there you invited me in
We spent the wee hours dancing
To your favorite home stereo sounds
We talked about what we been needin'
Discussin' our ups and our downs
And I've had a beautiful time
Holding your heart next to mine
I poured out my feelings while you poured the wine
And I've had a beautiful time
If I seem a wee bit uneasy
You really sized me up right
There's somebody home still up waiting
She probably been waiting up all night
And I can't say I found any answers
But you listen while I ride alone
And you been a beautiful lady
And you kept me from being alone
And I've had a beautiful time
Holding your body next to mine
You poured out the feelings and then I poured the wine
And I've had a beautiful time
I've had a beautiful time
Holding your heart next to mine
We poured out the feelings and then we poured the wine
And I've had a beautiful time
You poured out your feelings while we poured the wine
And I've had a beautiful time
I just wanna look at you one more time
I always like to know how much I leave behind
Let this be the picture that I'll always have in mind
I just wanna look at you one more time
If I can't do you right I'll never do you wrong
That's why I think it's best for me to move along
I won't ever be myself unless I'm free to roam
Give me one last moment here and I'll be gone
And I just wanna look at you one more time
I always like to know how much I leave behind
Let this be the picture that I'll always have in mind
I just wanna look at you one more time
I just wanna look at you one more time
I always like to know how much I leave behind
Let this be the picture that I'll always have in mind
I just wanna look at you one more time
A man may have his trials and tribulations and at times he feels so low and so blue
But from now on I will be entirely different and I knew the moment I lost you
Well to all my worries and my disappointments there is still a little light shining through
Still within my heart I know there is another and I knew the moment I lost you
There is nothing we can do to get along now that's been proved unto me and to you
So why not let's be fair to each other for I knew the moment I lost you
If there's something I have done you've not forgiven
Just remember that I'm human same as you
Why not let's consider our mistakes dear for I knew the moment I lost you
I love you because you understand, dear, every single thing I try to do
And you're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me, but most of all I love you 'cause you're you
I love you because my heart is lighter every time I'm walking by your side
And I love you because the future's brighter, the door to happiness you opened wide
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
Deep inside this lonely prison where the pleasures are so few;
Where the walls are strong and the days are long and there's nothin' new.
I learned to play the guitar. 
I'm doin' the best I can.
I guess things could be worse 'cause I made the prison band.
I made the prison band.
Well there's ol' bashful Bill on the doghouse bass, 
Willie on the steel guitar. 
He hails from Pocatello and He drags a pretty mean bar.
Back on the drums is two-time Tom, a rimshot tempo man.
They call me their singin' Emcee 'cause I made the prison band.
Yes I made the prison band.
I'd been plannin' a break since Christmas. 
I had the details all worked out.
But now I know that I ain't gonna go and there ain't no doubt.
I had my try-out Sunday and the outcome changed my plans.
I gotta rehearse for the Friday night show 'cause I made the prison band.
I made the prison band.
Well there's Ol' bashful Bill on the doghouse bass, 
Willie on the steel guitar. 
He hails from Pocatello and He drags a pretty mean bar.
Back on the drums is two-time Tom, a rim shot tempo man.
They call me their singin' Emcee 'cause I made the prison band.
Yes I made the prison band.
I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came
Like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness
No more night
Now, I'm so happy
No sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
Just like a blind man
I wandered along worries and fears
I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man
That God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light
I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now, I have traded
The wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light
Today I started lovin' you again
And I'm right back to where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few memories of mine
I should have known the worst was yet to come 
And the crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you again
And I'm right back to where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
When I was young
My dad would say
"c'mon son, let's go out an' play"
Seems like only yesterday
When I was all by myself
I'd climb up the closet shelf
Find his hat an' fix the brim
Pretending I was him
No matter how hard I try
No matter how many tears I cry
No matter how many years go by
I still can't say goodbye
He took good care
Of Mom an' me
We all cut down the Christmas tree
He always had some time for me
Wind blows through the trees
Street-lights, they still shine bright
Most things are the same
But I miss my dad tonight
I walk by the Salvation Army store
Saw a hat like my daddy wore
Tried it on an' fixed the brim
Still tryin' to be like him
No matter how hard I try
No matter how many tears I cry
No matter how many years go by
I still can't say goodbye, Pa
Things I learned in a hobo jungle
Were things they never taught me in a class room
Like where to find a hand out
While bummin' through Chicago in the afternoon
Hey, I'm not braggin' or complainin'
I'm just talkin' to myself man-to-man
This ol' mental fat I'm chewin' didn't take a lotta doin'
But I take a lot of pride in what I am
I guess I grew up a loner
I don't remember ever havin' any folks around
But I keep thumbin' through the phonebooks
And looking for my daddy's name in every town
And I meet lots of friendly people
But I'll always wind up leavin' on the lam
Hey, where I've been or where I'm goin'
Didn't take a lotta knowin'
But I take a lot of pride in what I am
I never travel in a hurry
Because I got nobody waitin' for me anywhere
Home is anywhere I'm livin'
If it's sleepin' on some vacant bench in City Square
Or if I'm workin' on some road gang
Or just livin' off the fat of our great land
I never been nobody's idol but at least I got a title
And I take a lot of pride in what I am
I never been nobody's idol but at least I got a title
And I take a lot of pride in what I am
I take a lot of pride in what I am
I take a lot of pride in what I am
Could be holding you tonight
Could be doing wrong or start doing right
You don't care about what I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Hey, putting you down, don't square no deal
Least you'll know the way I feel
Take all the money in the bank
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Listen close and you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gon' change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Hurtin' me know don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here, don't feel no pain
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Once I lived a life of wine and roses
And I drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought my social friends would help me make me turn
But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses 
A victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause I kept the wine and threw away the rose
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn I made was not the one I'd planned
And I watched my social standings slip away from me
While I watched the bottle slowly take command
And now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses 
A victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause I kept the wine and threw away the rose
'Cause I kept the wine and threw away the rose
[ Both ]
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again
[ Merle ]
Our love grew cold a long time ago we both know love is gone
Yet we stay together we just keep hanging on
[ Bonnie ]
But it's wrong to live together when our love has reached an end
[ Both ]
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again
I wanna be kissed like I used to be thrilled like I used to be
Loved like I used to be I wanta live again
[ Bonnie ]
Each time we kiss we search for love that used to fill our hearts
But it's all wrong the thrill is gone we're just too far apart
[ Merle ]
We live a life of loneliness each day that we pretend
[ Both ]
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again
I wanna be kissed like I used to be...
I pulled into Memphis thirteen minutes early first time in two weeks
There's where she came to meet me as I stepped down off of 51 and needed sleep
And the baby's overdue I know you need some things
But the more that we discuss it it's the same
Long train rolling got a feeling and I'm knowing she's not waiting for me
These rails keep getting longer and this feeling's getting stronger she won't let me be
I love my woman fire and rain but I won't give up my train
Baby came in April while I was in Chicago in the pouring rain
Black car and rusty tanker three boxcars and an empty sack of mail
And though I get lonely sometimes I know there's just no other way to explain
Long train rolling
Long train rolling
There's not much a man can do inside a prison
Just take his memory trips and fights the pain
And a word from home can mean so much to a prisoner
It's been years now since that last letter came
Not a day goes by that I don't think of mama
And my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet Marie
And old friends I ran around with keep on running through my mind
And I just wonder if they ever think of me
I wonder if they know that I'm still living
And still proud to be a part of Uncle Sam
I wonder if they think I died of hunger
In this rotten prison camp in Vietnam
Not a day goes by that I don't think of mama
And my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet Marie
And I remember daddy sayin' "you'll come back a better man"
And I just wonder if they ever think of me
Oh, I just wonder if anyone thinks of me
I feel like a stranger in this home I built for you
And I can't understand this awful change you're going through
But lately I've been watching you grow colder every day
And I'd rather be gone than in your way
I'd rather be gone than in your way I'd rather see someone else here in my place
And if I decide on leaving my world will end today
But I'd rather be gone than in your way
I'd rather be gone...
I'd rather be gone
Revenge must be the reason,
Why forgiveness was a thing I never knew.
And someday soon I know you plan to hurt me,
But don't plan on getting by with the things you do.
'Cause I'll always know when you been cheating.
And I'll always know you've been untrue.
I'll always know.
Your heart is like a window,
But when I look inside I see another man.
But go on and lie and tell him how you fooled me,
But remember I saw through you're evil plan.
'Cause I'll always know when you been cheating.
And I'll always know you've been untrue.
I'll always know.
And don't forget it either.
Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To that home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away, everybody say right here

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I'll fly away, here we go

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away, little sister let me hear you play

Just a few more weary days and then
Let me hear it, I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away, one more time real loud

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away, big finish
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away
I'll get by as long as I have you
Though there'll be rain and darkness too
I'll not complain, I'll see it through
Poverty may come to me, it's true
But what care I, say
I'll get by as long as I have you
Poverty may come to me, it's true
But what care I
I'll get by as long as I have you
If the world keeps on turning, and I'm sure it's bound to do
Then I'll keep on loving you
And if the dawn comes tomorrow, and we know that it is true
Then I'll keep on loving you
What the thing changes sky to fall, the dawn wouldn't come, the world wouldn't stall
I wouldn't care as long as you're near; it wouldn't matter to me at all
And if the stars stay in heaven, and the moon stays in the blue
Then I'll keep on loving you
If I ever should lose you, then I know just what I'll do
I'll just keep on loving you
You are heaven to me, dear; you are every dream come true
And I'll keep on loving you
Life is so sweet when you are near; I couldn't do without you, my dear
I love you, so I want you to know I think of you wherever I go
And I will always be faithful, and I'm sure that you will too
And I'll keep on loving you, then I'll keep on loving you
You're so good woman,Lord you're just too good for me
The way I am is the way I'll always be
No all around all of my life
You could have done better 'cause you've been a good wife
You're so good woman,Lord you're just too good for me
You're so good looking,Lord you could have done better than me
You're so good looking, you know could have done better than me
Look at the men, looking at you
While you're looking at me and I'm happy you do
You're so good looking,Lord you could have done better than me
Look at the men, looking at you
But you're looking at me Lord I'm happy you do
You're so good looking,Lord you could have done better than me
       
And you're so good woman you're just too good for me
I've been away for so long fought a war that's come and gone
Doesn't anybody know my name
My sister upped and wed mom was sick and took to bed
And my old dog Red's gone lame
Please tell me if you can what time the trains roll in
(Two ten six eighteen) ten forty four

This old house is falling down there ain't no need in me for hanging round
Doesn't anybody know my name
The girl I left behind she's gone with this friend of mine
I don't have to see a sign to know things ain't the same
Please tell me if you can...

You can't get far away on just a soldier's pay doesn't anybody know my name
Used to be when I could see everybody wanted me
Guess nobody cares to see a blind man catch a train
Please tell me if you can...
I scandalized my brother 
While admitting that he sang some pretty songs 
I'd heard that he'd been scandalizing me 
And Lord, I knew that that was wrong. 
Now I'm looking at it over somethin' cool 
And feeling fool enough to see 
What I had called my brother on 
Now he had every right to call on me. 
Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy 
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune 
That picker there's in trouble boy 
Ain't nothin' but another side of you. 
If we ever get to heaven boys 
It ain't because we ain't done nothin' wrong 
We're in this gig together 
So let's settle down and steal each other's song. 
I found a wounded brother 
Drinkin' bitterly away the afternoon 
And soon enough he turned on me 
Like he'd done every face in that saloon. 
Well, we cussed him to the ground 
And said he couldn't even steal a decent song 
But soon as it was spoken 
We was sad enough to wish that we were wrong. 
Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy 
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune 
That picker there's in trouble boy 
Ain't nothin' but another side of you. 
I know that it sounds silly 
But I think that I just stole somebody's song 
She's a good timin' woman 
In love with a good two timin' man. 
And she loves him in spite of the way 
That she don't understand.
Donna on my mind when I get up in the morning,
Donna on my mind the whole day through,
Love can't come so quick and real without any warning 
Wonder if she's thinking of me too. 
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me 
Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,
Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,
Till then I'll just have Donna on my mind. 
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me 
Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,
Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,
Till then I'll just have Donna on my mind.
Down, down, down came the world
I went round, round, round in a whirl
I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world

She must have loved a little
Just to keep me hanging on
How could lips that kiss so sweet
Lie and be so wrong?

Our love was just a pattern
Of the perfect boy and girl
The only dream I own
In this world

Down, down, down came the world
I went round, round, round in a whirl
I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world

I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world
Down, down, down came the world
Sweet dream baby,
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby,
How long must I dream.
Dream baby, got me dreamin'
Aweet dreams the whole day through.
Dream baby got me dreamin'
Sweet dreams in nighttime too.
I love you and I'm dreamin' of you
That won't do
Dream baby, help me stop my dreamin' of you
And make my dreams come true.
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby,
How long must I dream
Well, wake up pretty Mama and hear what I'm sayin'
You gotta stop them non-stop Elvis records you keep playin'
Take off your headphones, Baby, and pay a little mind to me
Elvis has left, but he's livin' in your memory
It's Love Me Tender ev'ry mornin', Don't Be Cruel ev'ry night
Hound Dog while we're makin' love, you know that ain't right
I'm All Shook Up and, Mama, that ain't all right with me
Elvis has left the building
Elvis has left the building
Elvis has left, and all ya got left is me
Alright
Well, I can twirl my hips (He can twirl those hips)
And I can curl my lips (He can curl that lip)
I can squint my eye, (Yeah), quiver my voice
C'mon, Baby, you ain't got no choice
Alright, um-um-um-um
I don't want your Money Honey, won't be your Teddy Bear
But I'll love you so tender, you'll swear the King is there
I'll buy some Blue Suede Shoes, tight pipe jeans
I'll eat them jelly doughnuts till I bust at the seams
Oh, Baby, wake up to reality
Elvis has left the building
Elvis has left the building
Elvis has left the building
But you can't see
Elvis has left, and all ya got left is me
Thank ya v'ry much
Each time you hurt me, you say you're sorry.
I try to understand, and say: "OK."
But there must be an end to understanding,
And the end of mine can't be too far away.
I try to understand that you're "only human".
And "we all make mistakes" every day.
But there must be an end to understanding,
And I know that I just can't go on this way.
Don't you know that love and understanding go together:
Ask too much of one and both will die.
And there must be an end to understanding,
And I know, someday, I'll reach the end of mine.
Don't you know that love and understanding go together:
Ask too much of one and both will die.
And there must be an end to understanding,
And I know, someday, I'll reach the end of mine.
I made it through my rock and roll years
With a spent dream and
A few dollar bills
I don't know what I learned
I don't know what I know
And if I don't now I never will
I ain't seen it all, but it's plain to see
I just might be an endangered species
Like an old gray fox, I know how he feels 
With the new hats snapping at my heels
I ain't sure what it's all about
I ain't in, but don't count me out
They all like to dance, but if you want to dance with me
You might be dancing with an endangered species
I wasted some time 
With some women I found
At no time ever settlin' down
With one over here and one over there
And that's where, nobody cares
But a man in love is what I want to be
I guess, that makes me an endangered species
I am the entertainer I know just where I stand
Another serenader another long haired man
Today I am your champion I may have won your heart
But I know the game you'll forget my name I won't be here in another year
If I don't stay on the charts
I am the entertainer had to pay my price
Things I didn't know at first I learned by doing twice
But still they come to haunt me still they want their say
So I learn to dance with my hands in my pants
Rub my neck and just write 'em a check and they'll be on their way
I am the entertainer I've been all around the world
I played all kinds of places played all kinds of girls
I don't remember faces I don't remember names
What the hell it's just as well cause after a while and a thousand miles
It all becomes the same
I am the entertainer I come to do my show
You heard my latest record spin on the radio
Well it took me years to write it the best years of my life
It's a beautiful song but it ran too long wanna have a hit you gotta make it fit
So they cut it down to 3:05
I am the entertainer Idol of my age
Make all kinds of money boy when I go on the stage
They see me in the paper and in the magazines
If I go cold my feet get sore put me in the back of the discount rack
like another can of beans
I am the entertainer know just where I stand
I am the entertainer
She's a rounder i can tell you that
She can sing 'em all night too
She'll raise hell about the sleep she's lost
But even cowgirls get the blues
Especially cowgirls they're the gypsy kind
And need their reins laid on 'em loose
She's lived to see the world turned upside down
Hitchin' rides out of the blue
Even cowgirls get the blues, sometimes
Bound to don't know what to do, sometimes
Get this feeling like the restless winds
The only way she's ever been
Lonely nights are out there on the road
Motel ceiling stares you down
There must be safer ways to pay your dues
But even cowgirls get the blues
I've got a new car, an' it drives just like a dream.
I've got money, an' can buy most anything.
I've got places to go an' things to do.
I've got everything, everything but you. 
I've got a date book that's just bulging at the seams.
I've got the numbers of all the local queens.
They give me memories that last a day or two.
I've got everything, everything but you. 
But this new car I drive don't mean anything,
Which reminds me: there's a payment overdue.
An' they say that I'm a man who's got everything.
Yeah, I've got everything, everything but you.  
An' this new car that I drive don't mean anything,
Which reminds me: there's a payment overdue.
An' they say that I'm a man who's got everything.
Yeah, I've got everything, everything but you.
These lines in my face, caused from worry,
Grow deeper as you walk out of sight.
Mine is the face of a fighter,
But my heart has just lost the fight. 
Round one: you told me you loved me,
An' I felt my heart falling there an' then.
The last round: you walked tall an' left me,
An' I guess my heart's losing again. 
Mine is the face of a fighter:
I fought for your love with all my might.
Mine is the face of fighter,
But my heart has just lost the fight. 
Yes, mine is the face of a fighter:
I fought for your love with all my might.
Mine is the face of fighter,
But my heart has just lost the fight.
I hear the train a comin' rollin' round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
Well I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on
While a train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
Well when I was just a baby my mama told me son
Always be a good boy don't ever play with guns
Well I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and I cry
Well I'll bet there's rich folks eatin' in some fancy dining car
Probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars
Well I know I had it comin' I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin' that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine
Bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay
Then I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
[Chorus]
I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring, and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me
I wasn't foolin' 'round the day I said I'd do
Many a night I wished that I've been foolin' too
I know it's foolish, taking all this misery
When it's you, a fool I'll always be
[Chorus]
Honey, fool around; you'll know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome 'cause I'm used to that
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me
[Chorus]
That's what you get for lovin' me that's what you get for lovin' me
Everything we had is gone if you can see that's what you get for lovin' me

Don't you shed a tear for me I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've had a hundred just like you but don't be blue
I'll have a thousand before I'm through
That's what you get for lovin' me...
[ guitar ]
There you go you're cryin' again you should have known how things would end
But someday when your poor heart is on the mend I just might pass this way again
That's what you get for lovin' me...
That's what you get for lovin' me
You work like a slave for the kids and I'd go to my grave for the kids
But we watched our love fade as we suffered that state
With this bargain we made for the kids
Divorce is a curse for the kids but this intention's much worse for the kids
Yes they're now old enough and they made the strongest stuff
Still it's gonna be rough for the kids
These teardrops that fall for the kids you know they're really not all for the kids
But I know you don't care and the only love there
Is the love that'd be shared for the kids
Find a new love you should for the kids and I hope that he's good for the kids
And though I'm now out of singht if he don't treat them right
I'll be right back and I'll fight for the kids
But I see you don't care the home that we shared
All our hopes and our prayers for the kids
Four strong winds that blow lonely 
Seven seas that run high 
All these things that don't change come what may 
But my good times are all gone 
And I'm bound for moving on 
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way 
I may go out to Alberta 
Weather's good there in the fall 
Got some friends that I could go to working for 
Still I wish you'd change your mind 
If I ask it one more time 
But we've been through that a thousand times or more 
If I get there before the snow flies 
And things are going good 
You could join me if I send you down the fare 
But if you wait until it's winter   it would do no good 
For the winds sure can blow cold way out there 
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I tied my bandana,took my pack from the floor
You were still sleeping,as I stood at the door
Once more I was heading to,God only knows where
That's when it hit me,I was already there

Chorus:
I could ramble,a thousand miles or more
Never find the light I've seen in your eyes before
You gave me the freedom to go on my own way
But you gave me much more,you gave me the freedom to stay

Why keep on running,just to wish on a star
Searching for Heaven,when I know where you are
Life is just empty,when you're walking alone
So wherever we're going girl,Lord it's good to be at home

Chorus
Frisco's a mile long away
You can afford to fly
But it might as well be the moon,
Lord, when you're as broke as I.
Here I sit with my head in my hands
Watching the trains roll by
Lord, the Helping Hand Mission man warned me
That the nights here got cold.
When you're cold there's nothing as welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothing as welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothing as slow as passin' time
When you're afoot Lord there's nothing as fast as a train.
Old Frisco's a mighty rich city
Now that ain't no lie
Well, they have some buildings
That reach nearly a mile in the sky.
Everyone's so busy they can't tell me the reason why
Here's a world full of people so damn many people alone
When you're alone life just don't seem worth living
While you're alive gotta learn to live with the pain.
You've been grown for so long
There's no one left who'll forgive
You find yourself searching your mind
For the links to the chain.
When you're cold there's nothing as welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothing as welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothing as slow as passin' time
When you're afoot Lord there's nothing as fast as a train
Well he smoked those Camel cigarettes about three packs a day
Nicotine stains on his fingers when he'd stretch them out to play 
That old "Midnight special" is one he loved to do
Then he'd sing "I'm walking the floor over you
TV preachers and welfare checks for him just had no place
But he'd take his time to tune real good when he sang 
"Amazing Grace" He'd say boys I'm old and crazy but I still give a damn
And I still think the boys got screwed over in Vietnam
He'd drag out that old uniform
And say "they used to call me slim"
He never could get it buttoned up
But the pride looked good on him
He still feels the way he felt
Over forty years ago
Here's to the old man
Here's to G.I. Joe
He only sang the old songs, he's standing still in time
"My Phillipino baby", right there on his mind
Then he'd talk about the big one, the war we didn't lose
He'd pick a little bit like Travis "Re-Enlistment blues"
Here's to my old man
And all the G.I. Joe's
Oh the games people now every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now never sayin' what they mean oh no
Well they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine oh yeah
Lotten da la da da da lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me and the games people play oh now
Well we make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame yes it does
People walkin' up to ya shouting glory hallelujah
Well they want to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord
Gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
Furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Lotten da la da da da...
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God give me the serenity to remember who I am
Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity cause you don't give a do de dee
Lotten da la da da da...
It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowing I'm not shacked
By forgotten words and boons
And the ink stains
That have dried upon some line

That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted
On their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory

And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us

And some other woman 's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy, might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind

But not to where I cannot see you
Walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands round a tin
Can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever you're just gentle on my mind
Lamps in the windows burnin' bright, over in Santa Fe tonight
Full moon shining down along the border
But the ground is hard and the night is black
Over here by the railroad track
And I wish to the Lord that I was back in Georgia
Blue water in the Indian sun,
Calling me when the day is done
Mama, mama pray for your son
All of my life I've been told
That the LA streets was paved with gold
Fame and fortune waiting to reward ya
But it didn't take long to understand
California ain't the promised land
But at least a man's a man in Georgia
Blue skies in the mornin' there
And there's green trees and breathin' air
Rockabye in my easy chair
Well it seems every river in the Georgia moonlight
Flowing up where folks are free
The sun comes up through the lonely pine trees
Over 'round the Kingsland ridge
I maybe here but my mind is still
About 90 miles north of Jacksonville
Well I may not make it, it's a long, long road
But mama I've paid all the debts I owe
And if I don't you know they gonna find me tryin'
They took my songs and they took my soul
They made me hard and they made me old
Hell I just been born, but I feel just like I'm dying
I bring it up
You're quick to cover it all up again
Thought we were friends
What are friends for?
The old bones in your closet
Must really embarrass you
And so to save face
It's a locked place
[Chorus]
I don't see why you don't get naked with me
Get all the little secrets out in the open air
'Cause we won't ever be
All that we could be
As long as you won't get naked with me
The future's gettin' shaky
From all this holdin' back
There's something in your past
That seems to haunt you
For better or for worse, I said
I meant it through and through
No one has ever loved you
More than I do
[Chorus]
Girl I can tell you're trying to work it out
Tryin' to get a handle on what life is all about
Between womenhood and nursery rhymes tryin' to find the truth in lovers lies
Girl I can tell you're trying to work it out
Girl I can see you're wantin' to give it a try
Taking all the good and the bad the truth and the lies
Feelings inside you you can't talk about feelings have a way of not comin' out
Girl I can see you're trying to work it out
[ guitar ]
Between womenhood and nursery rhymes looking for the truth in lovers lies
And the ties that bind the things that last through time
Girl I can tell you're trying to work it out
One foot on the mountain, the other one in the stream
All kinds of trouble and I'm caught in between
I can't change my way of doin'; it's gonna lay like it falls
If I can't go down rockin', I ain't gonna go down at all.
She was a child of acquired money, had that silver spoon
I knew she had a little wild streak and needed breathing room
If I can't be your sugar daddy, I won't be your Neanderthal
If I can't go down rockin', I ain't gonna go down at all.
Spent a little time in the congregation,
That's how I was raised
Spent a little time in trouble, but I do have my ways
Don't be your Neanderthal.
Tonight I had good intentions of crawling into bed
Resting my body and clearing my head
But, just about midnight, I got that telephone call
If I can't go down rockin', I ain't gonna go down at all.
Spent a little time in the congregation,
That's how I was raised
Spent a little time in trouble, but I do have my ways
If I can't go down rockin', I ain't gonna go down at all.
If I can't go down rockin', I ain't gonna go down at all
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon and dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray

Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud

Well, did he make you cry? Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale

Well, did he make you cry, make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?

Did he make you cry, make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?
I've thought I'd take a trip to Denver and spend a little time
I thought maybe out in Denver I might get you off my mind
No want no want go with me, just want to be alone
I might find someone in Denver that can help me carry on

Gone to Denver, gone to Denver, gone to mend a broken heart
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin' I'd better be gone, gone to Denver

Well, I've known a quiet wild, now I've been losing you
And I'd rather might stay here and find out who I lost into
Maybe I won't even miss you like I always thought I would
I've heard Denver's quite a city and it changed my do me good

Gone to Denver, gone to Denver, gone to mend a broken heart
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin' I'd better be gone, gone to Denver
Gone to Denver
I'm gonna write a letter, gonna mail it today
Just as soon as I think of the words to say
I've been needing to send it for nearly a year
There's a woman back home who's waiting to hear
I meant to tell you, dear Susannah
I'm a long way from Louisiana and you
And I know I promised to be returning
Just as soon as I've saved the money I'm earning for you
But I'm married to twins and I'm living in Peru
Well, I'm gonna write a letter
Get it off my mind
But you know the words
Are so hard to find
Sitting, thinking with my pen in my hand
How can I make her understand?
I meant to tell you, dear Julia
I'm a long way from the States, mosquitoes and you
I'll send some money to help with the kids
I'd like to thank you for all that you did
It's true Louisiana, and I'm with Susannah, too
Got me a letter, it arrived today
The words I read just blew me away
I don't believe I've ever felt so low
How could Susannah treat me so?
She said, "I meant to tell you, my sweet honey
I'm a long way from your love, your money and you
Please don't think me under
And I do believe you'll understand me too
I got a bar and grill with Phil in Kalamazoo
A long time forgotten are dreams
that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times
or the bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times
they've had and all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man

He likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Though she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man
Just the good ol' boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you ever saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born
Straigh'nin' the curve
Flat'nin' the hills
Someday the mountains might get 'em
But the law never will
Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow
I'm a good ol' boy
You know my momma loves me
But she don't understand
They keep a showin' my hands
And not my face on TV
Just the good ol' boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you ever saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born
Everybody's gone away said they're moving to LA
There's not a soul I know around everybody's leaving town
Some caught a freight some caught a plane
Find the sunshine leave the rain they say this town'll waste your mind
Must be right cause it's wasting mine
Some got to win some got to lose good time Charlies got the blues
My heart keeps telling me there ain't no kid at thirty-three
Play around you lose your wife you play too long you lose your life
I got my pills to ease the pain can't find a thing to ease the rain
Sometimes I'd like to try and settle down but everybody's leaving town
Some got to win some got to lose good time Charlies got the blues
A long time forgotten are dreams
that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times
or the bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times 
they've had and all the good times to come
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter 
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man
He likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Though she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter 
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man
There are songs that birds don't sing to people
There are secrets that keep right through to the end
There are heroes who hide until forever
And I'm singing this song for one of them
He's the man that you passed on the road there
The one with his life on the loose
Going either somewhere or nowhere
Going without me, without you
For he is this world's constant orphan
Traveling out his lone time
Living on apples from orchards
Dying from grapes on the vine
You can find him in big city winters
Down where the mission bell cries
And sorrow echoes through summer
As he tries to close all his eyes
You can find him in Pittsburgh in Christmas
You can find him in Buffalo in June
And he knows all the back roads between them
Like the gypsy knows the moon
And it's route 22 all over again
Stick your thumb out and try to look like somebody's friend
Look strong at the man, gentle at the girl
And puzzled at the rest of the world
Living on apples from orchards
Dying from grapes on the vine
Green River I've come back to you do you remember me
Do you remember Molly with the soft blue eyes
I left here with a lot of dreams none of them came true
What I wanted was here waiting all the time
Green River did she come here every evening
Like the neighbors say she did so faithfully
Green River has she's gone away forever
She just disappeared one day as she gave upon me
Green River if you see her won't you tell her I'll return
All I've brought her is myself and this little dream
Please tell her that I love her and my lesson I have learned
Green River tell her please come back to me
That cold north wind is blowing grey eyes you know
The years are quickly going grey eyes you know
And the good life I promised you so long ago
Is dead but for a dreaming grey eyes you know
We never had much money grey eyes you know
More rainy days than sunny grey eyes you know
And life has been a long hard road to hoe
But you stuck right by me smiling grey eyes you know
Hard times took the blue from your eyes
Leaving them grey as the winter's skies
We've had our talk now I must walk away
Leave you here beneath this mound of clay
And I feel so empty as I turn to go
For my heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know
My heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know
Well I grew up lean and hungry I worked hard for my money
Said I'm gonna live my life the way I please
Spent some time on the road of life saw an angel once and the devil twice
I came across some things that I don't need
Like a cold hearted women whiskey in my water
And only one way out of a motel room
Payments on the Cadillac and too many questions
And old guitars that just won't stay in tune
You know there's good and bad breaks you learn from your mistakes
It's all in how you handle them do's and don'ts
A hillbilly boy is hard to convince wild and stubborn and not much sense
But I've got enough to know what I don't want
Like a cold hearted women whiskey in my water...
And old guitars that just won't stay in tune
If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
It's true you have me twisted round your finger and it seems that's where I belong
You know how to hold me to thrill me and control me
Just enough to keep me hangin' on
For now tomorrow and forever I guess I'm tied to you right or wrong
My love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showing
Just enough to keep me hangin' on
A love that's strong as mine will make me do most anything
Like hiding tears and heartaches and dreaming silly dreams
You've got me where you want me you keep stringing me along
Just enough to keep me hangin' on just enough to keep me hangin' on
He went to Paris looking for answers to questions
That bothered him so
He was impressive, young and aggressive
Saving the world on his own
Warm summer breezes, French wine and cheeses
Put his ambition at bay
The summers and winters scattered like splinters
And four or five years slipped away
He went to England, played the piano, and married
An actress named Kim
They had a good life, she was a good wife
And bore him a young son named Jim
All of the answers and all of the questions
He locked in his attic one day
Cause he liked the quiet clean country livin'
And twenty more years slipped away
War took his baby,
Bombs killed his lady and left him
With only one eye
His body was battered, his whole world was shattered
All he could do was just cry
While the tears were falling he was recalling
Answers that he never found
So he hopped in a freighter, skidded the ocean
And left England without a sound
Now he lives in the islands, fishes the piling and drinks
His Green label each day
Writing his memoirs, losing his hearing
But he don't care what most people say
After eighty-six years of perpetual motion
If he likes you he'll smile and say
"Jimmy, some of it's magic, probably tragic,
But I had a good life all the way"
He went to Paris looking for answers to questions
That bothered him so
They're working while I'm missing you those healing hands of time
And soon they'll be dismissing you from this heart of mine
They'll lead me safely through the night and I'll follow as though blind
My future tightly clutched within those healing hands of time
They let me close my eyes just then those healing hands of time
And soon they'll let me sleep again those healing hands of time
So already I've reached mountain peaks and I've just begun to climb
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time
Heartache number one was when you left me I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back but never meant to stay
I've got heartaches by the numbers troubles by the score
Every day you love me less each day I love you more
I've got heartaches by the numbers a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
[ guitar ]
Heartache number three was when you called me
You said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on my door
I waited but you must have lost your way
I've got heartaches by the numbers...
Sometimes it's heaven,sometimes it's hell
Sometimes I don't even know
Sometimes I take it as far as I can
Sometimes I don't even go
My front tracks are headed for a cold water well
My back tracks are covered in snow
Sometimes it's heaven,sometimes it's hell
Sometimes I don't even know
Heaven ain't walking a street paved with gold
Hell ain't a mountain of fire
Heaven is laying in my sweet baby's arms
Hell is when my baby's not there
My front tracks are headed for a cold water well
My back tracks are covered in snow
Sometimes it's heaven,sometimes it's hell
Sometimes I don't even know
Sometimes it's heaven,sometimes it's hell
Sometimes I don't even know
I'm gonna change my ways of doing things around here
I'm turning over a new leaf gonna get myself in gear
'Cause I've got a woman who's better than most
And I've made a mess of her plans
So startin' today all I'm gonna be is her man
I've been a wild catter and a go go getter
Been an SOB right down to the letter
I've had misadventures I even got pictures
Of even more than I can stand
So startin' today all I want a be is her man
I'm gonna give it all back cause all I've done is take
I've put her on the back burner while I was out on the make
But I've got a woman who's good enough to give me
A second chance again
So starting today all I'm gonna be is her man
I've been a wild catter and a go go getter...
I'm a little bit late but I'm wise enough
I'm taking her by the hand
Startin' today all I want a be is her man
Son you make me feel so proud I pop the buttons off my shirt
I know I said I'd take you to the lake today
But I'm going to have to break those plans, and it really hurts
Every time I go fishin' it'd always start me wishin'
That I could be a child again
Take my 50 cents and go down to the local picture show
To watch my heroes rope and ride
Most times they'd win but when they'd lose it always made me cry
Ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all
Well I guess the fish just ain't bitin' just as well I don't feel like fightin'
All in all it just ain't that great a fishin' day that old newspaper headline
Kind of wrapped around this old heart of mine another big one got away
And I can't count the times he's made me laugh
But this time he's made me cry
There ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all
Hey, hey, good lookin',
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
Hey, sweet baby,
Don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe?
I got a hot-rod Ford and a two-dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill.
There's soda pop and the dancin's free,
So if you wanna have fun come along with me.
Hey, good lookin',
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
I'm free and ready,
So we can go steady.
How's about savin' all your time for me?
No more lookin',
I know I've been tooken 
How's about keepin' steady company?
I'm gonna throw my date-book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents.
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page.
Hey, good lookin',
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
[Chorus]
Hey Willie let's pack up and catch us a slow train
And go back to Phoenix to a far brighter day
Where stars were for shining in the Arizona sky
And music meant more than fortune or fame
Willie, we wandered from border to border
Singing our stories and living our songs
Seems the farther we go, all that grows closer
Is a mind full of memories we made years ago
[Chorus]
We rolled through the towns like a bus load of gypsies
Motels and hotels ain't no place to stay
The favors we're taking, the money we're making
Won't pay for the living,we're giving away
[Chorus]
I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive
I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still
I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around
I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again
Home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you,
Or any place on earth that you may be.
Home is where you're happy, just any house will do,
And I'll feel at home as long as you're with me.
This room could not hold me for one short minute;
If you weren't here with me, I'd soon be gone.
That chair is just a chair when you're not in it.
It takes more than rooms and chairs to make a home.
Home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you,
Or any place on earth that you may be.
Home is where you're happy, just any house will do,
And I'll feel at home as long as you're with me.
Time, someday, may cause this house to crumble,
But we'll move into another, love and all.
And if time, someday, should make your footsteps stumble,
I'll be there to catch you, should you fall.
Home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you,
Or any place on earth that you may be.
Home is where you're happy, just any house will do,
And I'll feel at home as long as you're with me.
I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket for my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.
[Chorus]
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, 
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
[Chorus]
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
[Chorus]
Silently for me.
Well I left my home down on a rural route
And I told my folks I'm goin' steppin' out
To get the honky tonk blues the jumpin' honky tonk blues
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues
In and out of every joint in this town
The city life has really got me down
I got the honky tonk blues the honky tonk blues
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues
[ guitar ]
I'm gonna slap my boogie underneath my arm
Scud right back in my pappy's farm
And lose these honky tonk blues the jumpin' honky tonk blues
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues
[ steel ]
Well I left my home down on a rural route...
There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and me
Oh God, I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sowed these old blue jeans
My father was a gambler, Lord
Down in New Orleans

The only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's ever satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Go tell my baby sister
Not to do the the things I've done
Outshine that house down in New Orleans
That they call the Rising Sun

There is a house down in New Orleans
That they call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and me
Oh God, I'm one
How much is it worth to live in L.A.?
That land of silk and money where the pretty people play
When they itemize insanity, how much will you pay?
How much is it worth to live in L.A.?
Now I'm not here to criticize or to put nobody down
But they're wierding out in Hollyweird every time you turn around
And when it comes to crazy, I know whereof I speak
And I know where I'd be leaving if I were walking in their feet
How much is it worth to live in L.A.?
That land of silk and money where the pretty people play
When they itemize insanity, how much will you pay?
How much is it worth to live in L.A.?
There's a freeway full of traffic going every which way
People dodging bullets, crawling down the interstate
They keep waiting for the big one, one tremor at a time
Ain't nobody living there, it's all a state of mind
How much is it worth to live in L.A.?
That land of silk and money where the pretty people play
When they itemize insanity, how much will you pay?
How much is it worth to live in L.A.?
How much is it worth to live in L.A.?
That land of silk and money where the pretty people play
When they itemize insanity, how much will you pay?
How much is it worth to live in L.A.?
I look for trouble and I found it son

Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun

I tried to run but I don't think I can

You make one move and you're a dead man friend

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back

And left me reeling on a steel reel rack

They got'em all in the jailhouse baby

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


Grew up in Houston off the wayside drives

Son of a carhop and some all night dives

Dad drove a stock car to an early death

All I remember was a drunk man's breath

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


You know the story how the wheel goes 'round

Don't let them take you to the man down town

Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse baby

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


I live with Angel she's a roadhouse queen

Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee

I want to love her but I don't know how

I'm at the bottom in the jailhouse now

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?


You know the story about the jailhouse rock

Don't want to do it but just don't get caught

They got'em all in the jailhouse baby

Ain't living long like this

Can't live at all like this,can I baby?
A thousand ways, a thousand days 
The song of the world haunts a memory 
I played my part, it broke my heart 
But on the mend, I found a friend 
I belong to him, I belong to him 
Oh, he'll sing a song, I'll even drive along 
'Cause the songs I hear are from forever 
Another day, another way we both sing together 
I belong to him, I belong to him 
Take my hand, and let's hold his hand, let's stand together 
I wash his feet as I wash your feet; let's all sing together 
I belong to him, I belong to him 
I belong to him, I belong to him 
I belong to him, I belong to him 
I belong to him, I belong to him
Take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now your love was all I was after
I'll make it now that I can get off on you
I can get by on little or nothing at all I know
I can get high just thinkin' about you and so

Well take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now your love was all I was after
I'll make it now I can get off on you

Who would have thought this was somethin' that I'd ever do
I'm working it out mellowing out on you
Take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now your love was all I was after
I'll make it now  that I can get off on you

Take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
[Chorus:]
In my own way I'm a believer
In my own way right or wrong
I don't talk too much about it
It's something I keep working on
I don't have too much to build on
My faith has never been that strong
There's a man in that old building
He's a holy man, they say
He keeps talking about tomorrow
While I keep struggling with today
He preaches hell, fire and brimstone
And heaven seems so far away
I do believe in a higher power
One that loves us one and all
Not someone to solve our problems
Or to catch me when I fall
He gave us all a mind to think with
And to know what's right or wrong
He is that inner spirit
That keeps us strong
[Chorus]
I don't mind I don't mind I did for a time but I don't mind
It used to break my heart each time you cheated
I tried to leave the Lord knows how I tried
But I stay here no matter how I'm treated and all it really cost me was my pride
But I don't mind I don't mind I did for a time but I don't mind
You and I have a perfect understanding you come and you go as you please
And I never get too angry or demanding it's hard to get mad on your knees
But I don't mind I don't mind I did for a time but I don't mind
Once I was strong as a mountain I stood tall like a giant oak tree
Now my blood runs thin like water in a fountain you took all the man out of me
But I don't mind baby I don't mind I did for a time but I don't mind
You don't know what's good for you you won't leave me alone
I know you've got a family sleepin' at home
Don't make me go out off my way don't tempt me please
Don't you be so nice to me I fall in love so easily
I'm all alone and need someone I guess that it shows
But the things you make me want to do I'll regret I know
So don't say things that you don't mean cause I just might believe
Don't you be so nice to me I fall in love so easily
I'm gonna leave tonight with you go on and have your fun
I don't want to be a part of what I might have done
I'm tempted when I think about the things that might have been
And I'll admit I'd like to try but I know I couldn't win
And so instead I'll say goodbye I know it's time to leave
'Cause you been so nice to me and I fall in love so easily
'Cause you been so nice to me I fall in love so easily
'Cause you been so nice to me
Don't get no attention from the people on street
They don't even see us they just step right on our feet
Just two unnoticed people in this great big world are we
And when I think about it yes that's all we'll ever be
But I got you and you got me and if they look they can see that we don't care
I got you and you got me and baby that's all we will ever need
Looking through the window of a fancy diamond store
Going window shopping for the things we can't afford
People all around us with their noses in the air
They walk right on by us just like we're not even there
But I got you and you got me...
I got you and you got me...
I got you and you got me and baby that's all we will ever need
When I was one, till I was three
My mom and dad took care of me
Now I'm four and the world's alive
And I just can't wait until I'm five.
I just can't wait until I'm five.
When I am six there is a rule
Kids like me all start to school
Somewhere between seven and eight
I'll start to grow and I just can't wait.
I'll start to grow and I just can't wait.
Nine is weird as it can be
My brother's nine and he picks on me
But I just can't wait until I'm ten
I'll be completely grown by then.
I'll be completely grown by then
You tear me down a hundred times a day I've cried enough to wash the world away
I've tried so hard to be what you've wanted me to be
'Til somewhere along the way I lost me
To give and keep on giving I have learned
There's no way but yours where you're concerned
I tried till finally I lost my own identity and somewhere along the way I lost me
Somewhere along the way I lost the man I used to be
A man who smiled enjoyed life loved you with all of me
You'd never once considered how I felt so go ahead and live my life yourself
I've tried so hard to be what you wanted me to be
Somewhere along the way I lost me somewhere along the way I lost me
Well my baby you're a looker and I know what you're looking for
You've been looking over, every man at the bar
Honey, I know I've got a few years on you
But if you're shopping around let me tell you a thing or two
Well I look a little rough and I got a few miles on me
My body needs work and my style ain't what it used to be
And honey I'll admit there's places where I'm wearing thin
But I ain't broke down, I just couldn't hold it in
[Chorus]
Well I may be worn, but baby I ain't worn out
Let me take you for a ride and I'll show you what I'm talking about
I guarantee, there's a lot of me left to love
Well I may be used but baby I ain't used up
I've been wrecked a few times and honey it shows I guess
There's been once or twice that you could say that I was repossessed
There's one little thing that I think ought to be understood
It ain't how you look, it's what you got under your hood
[Chorus]
Silver coins that jingle jangle 
Fancy shoes that dance in time 
Oh, the secrets of her dark eyes 
They did sing a gypsy rhyme. 
Yellow clover entangled blossoms 
In a meadow silky green 
Where she held me to her bosom 
Just a boy of seventeen. 
I recall a gypsy woman 
Silver spangles in her eyes 
Ivory skin against the moonlight 
And the taste of life's sweet wine. 
Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows 
Stir the darkness in my mind 
Oh, gentle woman you sleep beside me 
And little know who haunts my mind. 
Gypsy lady I hear your laughter 
And it dances in my head 
While my tender wife and babies 
Slumber softly in their bed. 
I recall a gypsy woman 
Silver spangles in her eyes 
Ivory skin against the moonlight 
And the taste of life's sweet wine
I don't drink campaign in crystal glasses
I don't sowed my beans in a silver pot
You won't catch me climb to the social classes
I don't spend money that I ain't got.
I don't waste my time with yesterday's troubles
I just try to do the job and hang
I ain't delegate that I ain't sudden
But I do the best I can.
I drink my beer from the bottle
I take my friends at their works, yes I do
I lived my life like I find it every morning
And I take my comfort in you, I take my comfort in you.
I don't put much stop in public companion
I take it all with the gravy zone
I make mistakes like any human being
So I got no caught go fine and bought.
I take my troubles to the Lord on Sunday
I take my blues to the honky tonk
You take my breath away way you hold me
What is could poor boy want.
I drink my beer from the bottle
I take my friends at their works, yes I do
I lived my life like I find it every morning
And I take my comfort in you, I take my comfort in you.
So long to you, hope I don't make you blue,
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.
Apart we've grown, now I can't go on alone.
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.
Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.
Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.
Send the rest to my hole in the ground.
I bow my head, cause in the mornin' I'm a gonna be dead.
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.
Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.
Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.
Send the rest to my hole in the ground.
This world that I live in is empty and cold the loneliness cuts me and tortures my soul
I'm no child of destiny and no fortune's son
I've just chased you so long now I'm too weak to run
A new day is here but nothing is new alone in my room I tremble for you
[ piano ]
I know I'll return to the backstreets again to find what I need to prove I'm a man
And there I'll treat shame like an old friend from home
That I can lean on till my misery is gone
A new day is here and nothing is new I'm a picture of weakness as I tremble for you
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself by myself when each day is through
I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine I walk the line

I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, let me, I walk in the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I met an old friend this morning
And I stopped him and called him by name
I said, "The years haven't changed you
But he said, "Good Lord, how you've changed!"
So we stood there and talked on the corner
And remembered the good times we had
Then he asked if we're happy together
And I only smiled and I said
"Yes, she keeps me off the streets
And she keeps me out of trouble
Sometimes at night, Lord, when I hear the wind
I wish I was crazy again, yes, I wish I was crazy again"
Then we stopped in at a tavern
We had us a round or two
We called ourselves old desperado's, old desperado's
As old friends are likely to do
We sat for a while and remembered
Then he said, "Let's have just one more"
I said, "I'd sure like to join you
But best be goin' on home"
"Yes, she keeps me off the streets
She keeps me off the streets"
Ah! It's just another wasted mornin'
While I'm holdin' up the wall
Too much tequila makes me wonder
Why I'm headin' home at all
Get that honky tonk feelin'
Every time your arms grow cold
I suppose that's the reason
I need a home away from home
So I'll say one more time
And I hope you'll understand
If I can't find it in your arms, babe
I'm gonna find it where I can
I can't refuse them lonely women
Lord, I know just how they feel
I suppose that's the reason
What you been givin' me makes me feel
Honey, I'm gettin' that honky tonk feelin'
Every time your arms grow cold
And I suppose that's the reason
I need a home away from home
So I'll say it one more time, one more time
And I hope you'll understand
If I can't find it in your arms, babe
I'm gonna find it where I can
If I can't find it in your arms, babe
I'm gonna find it where I can
I'll go back to her where I'm wanted and maybe I can make up for the wrong
in spite of all I've done she still wants me so I'll go back to her where I belong
Walking out on her wasn't easy but without a second thought I left her there
I gave my all and did it all to please you but the more I seem to do the less you care
So I'll go back to her...
[ steel ]
I'll go back to her...
That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
And when we're movin' on, oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I'm settin' you free
So keep movin' on

Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' on

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
Keep movin' me on, keeps rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
Keep rollin' on

I've warned you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
So I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You have broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
So I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I've warned you twice, you can settle the price
'Cause I'm movin' on

But someday baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on
I'm not Lisa, my name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight has touched your face

She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun

And then one winter day
His hand led hers away

She left you here drowning in your tears, here
Where you've stayed for years
Crying Lisa, Lisa

I'm not Lisa, my name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight shines through your face
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill 
He sounds too blue to fly
That means he's lost the will to live 
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a night so slow 
As time goes draggin' by
The moon just went behind the clouds 
To hide its face and cry
The silence of a falling star 
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are 
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry 
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm a long way from home and so all alone homesick like I never thought I'd be
I'm a long way from home everything is wrong someone please watch over me
I'm not a custom to this feeling loneliness is burning in my soul
Sometimes the mind is so mistreating I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told
I wish I knew the force within me that keeps my mind out of control
What makes me reach for things that I can't see
I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told
I'm a long way from home...
Hey, little lady is your man at home
Did he go and leave you all alone
And oh, I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire.
Tell me little lady is he good to you
Can he do to you good things I don't do
I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire.
Like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six inch valley
Through the middle of my soul.
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire.
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire.
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire.
I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through
I've been busted for things that I did, and I didn't do
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that I've done
But I can say I've never intentionally hurt anyone
I've always been different with one foot over the line	
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
Beautiful lady, are you sure that you understand	
The chances your taking loving a free living man
Are you really sure, you really want what you see
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to blame
So far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
When I look at you I think many strange things
And it's hard to express all of my feelings
I belong to a girl you hang around with
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.
I had to call and tell you just how I felt
You should know by now that
When you're near my heart melts
I belong to a girl you hang around with
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.
Eyes for you, eyes for you
Yes I must admit I've got eyes for you.
In my sleep I call your name
No one to blame I can't explain
And every time I see you it's the same thing
And I try to escape from looking your way.
I belong to a girl you hang around with
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.
Must admit I've got eyes for you, mm
I must admit I've got eyes for you
Come on now Willie don't look at me that way
I know you like a paperback book cause I've read every page
I know what you're thinkin' and I don't think you're thinkin' at all
This is old hoss that's you're talkin' to the one with the perfect recall
No I ain't going down on the border with you tonight
Drinking tequila taking chances on our lives
All the women are crazy they like to party till daylight
On second thought if I can find a clean shirt I might
Wait a minute Waylon I ain't said a thing about that
Sometimes I just like to wear my spurs and my old Mexican hat
But we sure had fun the last time that we were down there
And we woke up you had that weird tattoo and somebody had curled my hair
No I ain't going down on the border...
All the women are crazy they like to party till daylight
On second thought if I can find a clean shirt I might
Funny a woman can come on so wild and free
Yet insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch me
And stand by the bed and shiver as if she were cold
Just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were gold.
One night of love don't make up for six nights alone
I'd rather have one than none Lord I'm flesh and bone
Though sometimes it seems she ain't worth the trouble at all
She could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all.
Right or wrong a woman can own any man
She can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
Then leave him as weak and weary as a newborn child
Fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes.
One night of love don't make up for six nights alone
I'd rather have one than none Lord I'm flesh and bone
Though sometimes it seems she ain't worth the trouble at all
She could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
My friends all say that you're deceiving me
And things are going on that I don't see
I pay them no mind I love you so
And if you're guilty then I just don't want to know.
But if the shoe fits then wear it
If your mind hurts then bear it
It's your conscience to live with every day every night
If you find it hard sleeping
If you just lie there weeping
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right.
If you do wrong then it's your bill to pay
It's you there in that mirror every day
I love you and I plan to from now on
I just can't believe you do your daddy wrong.
But if the shoe fits then wear it
If your mind hurts then bear it
It's your conscience to live with every day every night
If you find it hard sleeping
If you just lie there weeping
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right.
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right
That's the very same door that I carried her through
On the night we were married last June
And right over there is the very same chair that she sat in when she said we're through
Over here you can see where I got on my knees and I begged but her heart was a stone
Over here's where I cried did you know I'd died right here in this very same room
To your right there's a crib and it's never been used perhaps that's why we're apart
And there sits a phone that she used on alone to make plans with her new sweetheart
Then she walked over here and she picked up her things then left me alone in the gloom
Over here's where I cried did you know I'd died right here in this very same room
Right here in this very same room
There's something on your mind, why don't you tell me?
You act as though your heart is miles away.
I speak to you but you don't even hear me.
Don't be unkind: is there something on your mind?
You look at me with eyes that never see me.
You're watching memories down in your heart.
Is there someone from the past you can't forget, dear?
Don't be unkind: is there something on your mind?
Even though you tried your best to love me,
I know I can't compete with memories.
So tell me now, before the vows are spoken.
While there's still time, is there something on your mind?
There you go and, baby, here am I
Oh well, you left me here so I could sit and cry
Why can't you see just what you doing to me?
I guess it doesn't matter anymore

Do you remember, baby, last September
How you held me tight each and every night?
Don't you know now, baby, you drove me crazy?
I guess it doesn't matter any more

There's no use in me just sittin' here and crying
I've done everything and now I'm sick of trying
Thrown away my nights, wasted all my days over you

You go your way, I'll go mine
Now and forever 'til the end of time
I'll find somebody new and, baby, we'll say we're through
Maybe someday you won't matter any more

There's no use in me just sittin' here and crying
I've done everything and now I'm sick of trying
Thrown away my nights, wasted all my days over you

You go your way, I'll go mine
Now and forever 'til the end of time
I'll find somebody new and, baby, we'll say we're through
Maybe someday you won't matter any more

There you go and, baby, here am I
Oh well, you left me here so I could sit and cry
Why can't you see just what you doing to me?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter anymore

You go your way, I'll go mine
Now and forever 'til the end of time
I'll find somebody new and, baby, we'll say we're through
You won't matter any more
Now that I've made up my mind you're gone it should be easier now
Perhaps now my heart will stop hanging on it should be easier now
The lesson I've learned from you gold can't buy a heart can be broken and still survive
Thanks to you now a much wiser man am I and it should be easier now
The worst now is over I've stood the test it should be easier now
They say everything happens for the best it should be easier now
The wounds in my heart you've carved deep and wide
Hollowed and washed by the tears I've cried
But now there'll be more room for love inside and it should be easier now
[Verse 1:]
  	If anyone ever finds a better way to love
	It'll be her,loving me
 	If anyone ever goes out of their way to show they care
 	It'll be her,loving me
[Chorus:]
	She's every women I've ever known rolled up in one
	If I'm ever loved anymore,she'll be the one
	To get it done,the way it should be
 	It'll be her,loving me
[Verse 2:]
	If ever I'm down and out and need someone to love
	It'll be her,loving me
 	When everyone else is cold and i need someone warm to hold
	It'll be her,loving me
[Chorus(x2)]
Well my baby used to stay out all night long she made me cry she done me wrong
Come home each morning tellin' me them same old lies
But now table has turned and it's her turn to cry
Because I used to love her but it's all over now
Oh yes I used to love her but it's all over now
Well she started runnin' round with every man in town
Spending all my money playin' a high class game
She would never change no matter how I tried
But the table has turned and it's her turn to cry
Because I used to love her...
I used to wake up in the morning get my breakfast in bed
When I was worried she would ease my achin' head
Now she's here and there with every guy in town
Still tryin' to take me for that same old clown
Because I used to love her...
It's not supposed to be that way you're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to control you
And like the other little children you're gonna dream a dream or two
But be careful what you're dreamin' or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you
It's not supposed to be that way you're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to console you
You go out to play this evenin' play with fire flies till they're gone
Then you rush to meet your lover play with real fire till the dawn
It's not supposed to be that way
Well, it's only rock and rollkeep you running from yourself
When the only way to slow down is to fall
It's only rock and roll that caused you to leave home
When the only way to get back is to crawl.
But the record people love you they can get you on the bill
Change your name to money dress up fit to kill
People all around you everywhere you go
Don't worry they love you son, it's only rock and roll.
Well, it's only rock and roll keep you jumping all the time
When you really ought to sit this one out
And it's only rock and roll keep on messin' with your mind
When you don't know what they're talkin' about.
All around the world everywhere you go
People got to have it, it's only rock and roll.
Only rock and roll only rock and roll
People all around everywhere you go
Don't worry if they love you 'cause it's only rock and roll.
Well, it's only rock and roll when your money's in the mail
And your love is on the back of the bus
And it's only rock and roll when your records start to sell
And you don't know why they're making such a fuss.
Telephone receiver ringing off the wall
Can I get a witness each and every call
Second that emotion chased into your soul
Don't worry lest you linger son, it's only rock and roll.
Only rock and roll only rock and roll
People all around everywhere you go
Don't worry if they love you 'cause it's only rock and roll.
Only rock and roll only rock and roll
People all around everywhere you go
Don't worry if they love you 'cause it's only rock and roll
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
Look into your heart and see
What your love book has set apart for me
It seems so easy (it seems so easy, it seems so easy,it seems so easy)
Oh, so doggone easy (doggone easy, doggone easy, doggone easy)
It seems so easy
Well, where you're concerned my heart has learnt
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
Love, they say is made for fools
Here I go breaking all of the rules
It seems so easy (it seems so easy, it seems so easy,it seems so easy)
Oh, so doggone easy (doggone easy, doggone easy, doggone easy)
It seems so easy (it seems so easy, it seems so easy,it seems so easy)
Oh, well, where you're concerned my heart has learnt
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion

And the frontmen all wanna go home

The straightmen all wanna be funny
The funny men all wanna get straight

The villains have turned into heroes
The heroes have turned into heels
The dealers all wanna be lovers
And the lovers all wanna make deals

The leaders are fallin' behind
So I'm singin' my songs to the deaf men
Dancing my dance to the blind

When I married Julie she was just seventeen
Pretty as the answer to any man's dream
From the start I gave Julie all the love that I've had
Though everyone told me that Julie was bad
Julie liked parties and clothes that fit tight
Drinking and dancin' around late at night
She was everything evil with the face of a child
But I sat home and waited while my Julie went wild
I had built me an empire with my own two hands
With the money and power to break any man
But with all my possessions power and gold Julie was one thing I couldn't control
I gave Julie all my money could buy begged her to love me but she wouldn't try
She'd only laugh then walk out the door
Each time she'd hurt me made me love her more
Now I'm locked in this room they say I'm insane
And I guess that I'll never see my Julie again
I'm a man with a heart and a tormented soul
And the mind that Julie drove out of control
Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keep on botherin' me
Chains that just won't set me free
Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms
Each night in dreams I see your face
Memories time cannot erase
Then I awake and find you gone
I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two open arms
That ol' lonesome feelin' all the time
Knowing you cannot be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we just could never keep
Too far away from lips so sweeet and warm
Just out of reach of my two open arms
Do you ever think about the one who thinks about you
Do you ever wonder dear why he's always waiting here for you
in spite of all the things you've said and done I'm a fool and you're the only one
I'll keep waiting while you'll have your fun just for you
Can't you see you're a part of me and everything I do
And every dream I dream is just for you
Do you ever think about the one who thinks about you
Do you ever wonder dear why he's always waiting here for you
It makes no difference what you do or say I'll be waiting here the same old way
Living every moment of each day just for you
[ guitar ]
It makes no difference what you do or say I'll be waiting here the same old way
Living every moment of each day just for you just for you mhm just for you
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
	Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
	How many hearts must break,how many will it take
	To satisfy you,just to satisfy you
	Another love,another fool
	To play your game
	Another love,another fool
	They're all the same
 
	Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
	Don't be surprised if that someone is you
	You're gonna find when it's too late,a heart that just won't break
	To satisfy you,just to satisfy you
	How many tears were cried,how many dreams have died
	To satisfy you,just to satisfy you
Kentucky woman
She shines with her own kind of light
She'd look at you once
And a day that's all wrong
Looks all right
And I love her
God knows, I love her

If she get to know you
She goin' to own you

Well, she ain't the kind
Makes heads turn at the drop of her name
But something inside
That she's got turn you on just the same
And she loves me
God knows, she loves me

Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you

I don't want much
The good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch
From that one girl, and life is
Sweet and good
Ain't no doubt
I'm talkin' about

Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you

Bessie was a lovely child from west Tennessee
Leroy was an outlaw wild as a mink
One day she saw him starin' and it chilled her to the bone
And she knew she had to see that look on a child of her own.
'Cause ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul.
Linda was a lady blonde and built to last
Benny was a no good guitar picker runnin' from his past
She heard all of his songs tellin' nothin' but bad news
But she made her mind up to try to get him win or lose.
Ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul.
Jessi like the Cadillacs and diamonds on her hands
Waymore had a reputation as a ladies man
Late one night a light of love finally gave a sign
Jessi parked her Cadillac and took her place in line.
'Cause ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul.
Ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul
South bound out of Shreveport heading hell bent for his grave
He reads a sign on the barn door that says the good lord Jesus saves
But I don't think Jesus knows him 'cause he ain't the Jesus kind
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind
He gave the folks a good show at the Shreveport Coliseum
They all heard he's dying, so they all come out to see
Friends and neighbors make him happy
Lord them snuff queens treat him kind
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind
Uppers, downers, turn arounders picked him up and laid him down
His old troubles keep on swimming 'cause their to damn mean to drown
He keeps looking for an answer I know he's never gonna find
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind
Big Bertha, back in Beaumont says he really turns her on
She hits the floor a dancing, when the DJ plays his song
You can see somebody loves him, or at least they did one time
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind
Uppers, downers, turn arounders picked him up and laid him down
His old troubles keep on swimming 'cause their to damn mean to drown
He keeps looking for an answer I know he's never gonna find
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind
I've never known one better
She's a real go getter
If you met her you'd be good as gone
She's a real red liner
Likes it all behind her
She's the kind that keeps you hangin' on
She's a cowboy's buddy
Even when she gets muddy
Lord she's lovely from her front to back
So either comin' or goin'
Know her best side's showin'
She's my cowboy Cadillac
She's the perfect picture
Of the perfect mixture
Tween a woman and a fine machine
She's a hard work lover
A real tough mother
She's the cover of a magazine
And I'm happy knowin' 
That what keeps me goin' 
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back
She's my honkin' tonkin'
Everything I'm wantin'
Cowboy Cadillac
She loves to haul them cattle
All my ropes and saddle
And it doesn't matter work or play
If it's a mountain she can crawl it
If it's hay then she can haul it
She's the last one to call it a day
She's the perfect picture
Of the perfect mixture
Tween a woman and a fine machine
She's a hard work lover
A real tough mother
She's the cover of a magazine
And I'm happy knowin' 
That what keeps me goin' 
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back
She's my honkin' tonkin'
Everything I'm wantin'
Cowboy Cadillac
Last thing I remember was saying,
"Hey y'all, watch this." Next thing I know I'm walking toward this light
When a voice from out of nowhere asked this question.
"Garth, what did you love most in your past life?"
"Well," I said, "it had to be between cowgirls and horses."
And as I wondered which one that I would settle on,
The voice said, "May you be happy with your answer."
I said, "What answer?" He said, "Watch this." And I was gone.
[Chorus]
Now I'm back as a cowgirl's saddle
Heaven on Earth for all eternity
Forever in between
Every cowboy's dream
Riding horses, holding rodeo queens
Sew me, show me, throw me in the pickup
Take me, break me, make me what you need
It's safe to say we're made for one another
And you'll never fall if you just stick with me
Fit me, sit me, get me how you want me
Wrap me, strap me, slap me on your steed
Can't believe I'm out here flying with an angel
Oh this afterlife's sure looking up for me
[Chorus]
Loping, roping, hoping that you're happy
Racing, placing, chasing all your dreams
Makes me think if I'd lived life a little better
Would I've come back as a pair of cowgirl jeans
[Chorus]
Every cowboy's dream
You know just what I mean
Riding horses, holding rodeo queens
Now I'm drifting into deep water I'm starting to care for you.
You're getting me in deep water be careful what you do.
Now you want a romance but I'm seeking love I know I was ready when it ends
'cause I'm winding up in deep water why can't we just be friends
 
Now it's restless in this deep water I'm off between right and wrong.
And my love is true as deep water your love won't last as long.
Now where will it lead me and where will it end? I can't help but wish I only knew
'cause I'm winding up in deep water so deep in love with you.
They married on a fancy yacht out on the water
He knew she was young enough to be his daughter
There're always questions in the heart of millionaires
Would she make heartfelt promises if the money was not there?
And he said, "Do you love me, baby? Do you want me to hold?
Or are you just digging for gold?
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul?
Or are you just digging for gold?"
She ran his weary heart through the ringer
And she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger
Well, his advances and affections she managed to avoid
But she got the lap of luxury, and he got paranoid
And he said, "Do you love me, baby? Do you want me to hold?
Or are you just digging for gold?
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul?
Or are you just digging for gold, digging for gold?"
Big house, limousines
Fine wines, fine cuisines
Vale and Vegas twice a year
Trips to Paris on the Leer
Black Tuesday when that wall of wealth came crashing down
Bad news day when that little queen had to give back her crown
And he said, "Hey babe, we can live on love 'cause love is worth much more."
But he barely got his feelings out, she was half way to the door
And she never even heard him cry
Do you love me, baby? Do you want me to hold?
Or are you just digging for gold?
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul?
Or are you just digging for gold?
Sometimes you've got to take the heat 
If you're gonna walk down the mean street 
Take the heat and you see it through 
"Cause sometimes it comes down to 
Do what you gotta do 
Sometimes it goes right down to the wire 
And you might have to walk through the fire 
Walk on  boy all the way through 
Sometimes it just comes down to 
Do what you gotta do 
Well  there's people that'll tell you 
It's just no use 
And there's people that'll tell you 
That you're gonna lose 
People that'll tell you 
Anything you're gonna listen to 
Do what you gotta do 
Someday they're going to call your name 
They'll come looking for some one to blame 
What's your name, boy 
Hey, you just tell them true 
"Cause they can't take the truth from you 
So do what you gotta do 
Well, they'll call you a hero or a traitor 
But you'll find out that, sooner or later, 
Nobody in this world is gonna do it for you 
Do what you gotta do 
There ain't nobody in this world 
That's gonna do it for you 
Do what you gotta do
Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand

See I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where there will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry
I know you loved him
A long time ago
Even now in my arms
You still want him I know
But darling this time
Let your memories die
When you hold me tonight
Don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes
Let it be me
Don't pretend it's him
In some fantasy
Darling just once
Let yesterday go
You'll find more love
Than you've ever known
Just hold me tight
When you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

Maybe I've been a fool
Holding on all this time
Lyin' here in your arms
Knowing he's in your mind
But I keep hoping some day
That you'll see the light
Let it be me tonight
Don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes
Let it be me
Don't pretend it's him
In some fantasy
Darling just once
Let yesterday go
You'll find more love
Than you've ever known
Just hold me tight
When you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes
Let it be me
Don't pretend it's him
In some fantasy
Darling just once
Let yesterday go
You'll find more love
Than you've ever known
Just hold me tight
When you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

Just hold me tight
When you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
Day after day I'm more confused
And I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know, that's a game, that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginin' to think, that I'm wastin' time
And I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
And I'm countin' on you, to carry me through

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

And when my mind is free
You know your melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitars come on through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
And rhythm, and rhyme, and harmony
You helped me along, you're makin' me strong

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Take me, oh take me
With all of my heart, I know I could love you
But with all of my soul, I'm driftin' away
With all of my mind, I know you could save me from myself and anything else
With all of my strength, I wanna reach out for you
With every breath, I call out your name
With every step, I just wanna turn around and say
Baby, make it okay
But I'm so afraid
That you've forgiven me one too many times
And I'm so afraid
To give my heart again just to have a change of mind
And I'm not quite sure that you can trust me
And I would hate to have you find me again
Baby, like the wind, driftin' away
It blows and nobody knows where it's going to
(I'm driftin' away)
It blows and nobody know what it's gonna do
With all of my heart, I know I disappointed you
And although I'm real sorry
I don't know how to save this time
But if I would lose you
I know I would go completely out of my mind
I'm running out of time
And I'm so afraid that you've forgiven me one too many times
And I'm so afraid to give my heart again just to have a change of mind
And I'm not quite sure that you can trust me
And I would hate to have you find me again
Baby, like the wind, driftin' away
It blows and nobody knows where it's going to
(Driftin' away)
It blows and nobody knows what it's gonna do
(You see my heart at night)
At night you can hear it cry as the tear drops fall from Heaven's eyes
(Fallin' down)
And somehow you know it's true these tears that fall are fallin' for you
(Fallin' for you)
It blows and nobody knows where's it going to
(Fallin' down)
It blows and nobody knows what it's gonna do
At night you can hear it cry as the tear drops fall from Heaven's eyes
And somehow you know it's true these tears that fall are for you
I walked down to the park last night
Warm breeze stirring up a soft moonlight
And my mind started drifting to way back when
Yes I do think about you every now and then
The other day I saw a car like you used to drive
I got a funny feeling down deep inside
And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin
Yes I do think about you every now and then
[Chorus]
I love my life and I've never trade
Between what you and me had and the life I've made
She's here and she's real, but you were too
and every once in a while I think about you
I heard a song on the radio just yesterday
The same one you always asked me to play
And when the song was over 
I wished they played it again
Yes I do think about you every now and then
[Chorus]
I've been layin' here all night listenin' to the rain
Talkin' to my heart and trying to explain
Why sometimes I catch myself
Wondering what might have been
Yes I do think about you every now and then
Every now and then
Every now and then
There was a bad boy in the school yard 
Waited on you every day 
Seemed like every time you turned around 
Well he was standin' in your way 
Well he broke your glasses 
The girls all laughed 
As he pushed you to the floor 
But then you stood up one day knowin' 
You couldn't stand it anymore 
And your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage 
You were face to face 
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well now brother wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 
Your date showed up with flowers 
And you thought your dreams had come 
But with every passing hour 
You felt it come undone 
Then the night exploded and you begged him no 
But he forever changed your life 
And now he waits a judge and jury 
Thinkin' you'll break down inside 
And with a finger you can put his fists away 
And you're face to face 
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well little sister wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 
'Cause it'll never go away 
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced 
Drivin' by the grave yard 
On a wicked winter's eve 
And you're wonderin' why a man of faith 
Is whistlin' nervously 
Then you stop the car 
And you hold your heart 
'Cause you finally realize 
Hell, the devil ain't in the darkness 
He's a'rattlin' 'round inside 
And with folded hands you truly start to pray 
And you're face to face 
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well now brother wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 
'Cause it'll never go away 
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced 
Face to face
Lazy yellow moon coming up tonight
Shining through the trees
Crickets are singing and lightning bugs
Are floating on the breeze, baby, get ready

'Cross the field where the [unverified] turns back
By the old stump road
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows, baby, get ready

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight

We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night
Just moving slow
Spend the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

Spring is almost over and the summer's coming
The days are getting long
I've waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along, baby, get ready

And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
We'll jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night, baby, get ready

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight

We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night
Just moving slow
Spend the whole night through
Feels so good to be with
You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight

We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night
Just moving slow
You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows

Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night
Just moving slow
You and me going fishin' in the dark
His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high
His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold
He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man
Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king
He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on
'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore
Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king
We were walking 'long the ocean
Together hand in hand
When I stopped to write "I love you" in the sand
And when I looked up you were standing
Ten miles out at sea
And in a sweat
I woke up from that crazy dream
As I reached to hold you in the morning light
It was just your pillow
I clung to so tight
(chorus)
For a minute there
I thought it was you
For a minute there
My prayers had finally come true
For a minute there
I began again to live
What I wouldn't give
For just a minute there
Five o'clock on Friday
Sitting at a light
When this angel walked right by me
On my right
And the cars all started honking
As my feet hit the ground
And though I chased and called
You never turned around
Oh the walk, the hair, the perfume
Where the same
How I wished she would have answered
To your name
(Repeat Chorus)
Tonight the stars in heaven
Are bright as they can be
And I swear one of them
Is winking down at me
(Repeat Chorus)
What I wouldn't give
How I'd love to live
For just a minute there
Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said "honey, we may be through"
But you'll never hear me complain

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and far away 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born 
The shepherds all were watching 
Over their sheep at night 
When a guiding star shone from heaven 
And the followed that holy light 
Got tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born 
They found a lovely manger 
Where the humble Christ was born 
And God sent out salvation 
On that blessed Christmas morn 
Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born 
He brought with Him forgiveness 
He live to show us the way 
He came to redeem all creation 
And to wash all our sins away

That Jesus Christ is born
God rest ye merry gentlemen 
Let nothing you dismay 
Remember Christ our savior 
Was born on Christmas day 
To save us all from Satan's power 
When we were gone astray 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
From God our heavenly father 
The blessed angel came 
And unto certain shepherds 
Brought tidings of the same 
How that in Bethlehem was born 
The Son of God by name 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
Fear not said the angel 
Let nothing you alright 
This day is born a savior 
Of the pure virgin bright 
To free all those who trust in him 
From Satan's power and might 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
And when they came to Bethlehem 
Where our dear savior lay 
They found him in the manger 
Where oxen feed on hay 
His mother Mary knelled down 
And to the Lord did pray 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
God rest ye merry gentlemen 
Let nothing you dismay 
Remember Christ our savior 
Was born on Christmas day
From the hills of Kaycee, Wyoming,
Where life's wooly and wild
Came a Air Force brat, in a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile

And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy song
We were much to young, having too much fun
As we all sang along

And we sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and the crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride"

(Take a ride)

Well gold buckles to gold records
Once again he was spinnin' round
Took the whole world on, and he turned us on
To that Western underground

And from bareback jack to this cowboy's hat
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down, from town to town
Like children running through the rain

And he sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride"

We sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it (yeah!)
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight ("let me have it!"), and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride"

Then he crossed that River Jordan
With St. Peter on the other side
Singin' "Good ride, cowboy, good ride"
Say "Good ride, cowboy, good ride!"
We met as soul mates
On Parris Island
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp
As sharp as knives
And we were so gung ho
To lay down our lives

We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast
To travel light
Our arms were heavy
But our bellies were tight

We had no home front
We had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy
They gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep
And shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ
With all of our might

We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our door's tapes
And it was dark
So dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together

Remember Charlie
Remember Baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong?
And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight

We held the day
In the palm
Of our hand
They ruled the night
And the night
Seemed to last as long as six weeks
On Parris Island

We held the coastline
They held the highlands
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

I laughed at love cause I thought it was funny
You came along and moved me honey
I've changed my mind
This love is fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

Kiss me baby
Mmmm feels good
Hold me baby
You've gotta let me love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I'ma tell this world that you're mine mine mine mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm gettin' nervous, honey, but it sure is fun
C'mon baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

Well kiss me baby
Ohh feels good
Hold me baby
Yeah I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
C'mon baby, you're drivin' me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!
Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
They'll all lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on
Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone and make him mine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
'Cause I'll be fine, ooh
If never I'd met you
I'd never have seen you cry
If not for our first hello
We'd never have to say goodbye
If never I held you
My feeling's would never show
It's time I start walkin'
But there's so much you'll never know
I keep telling you hard luck woman
You ain't a hard luck woman
Rags, a sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags, I really love you
I can't forget about you
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
Before I go let me kiss you
And wipe the tears from your eyes
I don't wanna hurt you, girl
You know I could never lie
I keep telling you a hard luck woman
You ain't a hard luck woman
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
Rags, a sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags, I really love you
I can't forget about you
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
Hard luck woman
Hard luck woman
Hard luck woman
Hard luck woman

Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

"911, what's the nature of your emergency?"
Help me, 911 operator, got a Friday night emergency
I need nursin' 'cause I'm hurtin' from a long week workin'
And I'm thirstin' for a remedy
I need a red-head, brunette, or blonde
Angel have mercy that will put me through intensive care
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Hang on, don't hang up on me, lady
Gotta take me to the promised land
'Cause I'm dying to see something like a jukejoint jumpin'
To a thumpin' little five piece band
I need a red dirt 'n swingin'
Just anything that's country
Karaoke, I don't care
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk
Girl, you gotta get me there
I've tried the phone at the road
Mapped Siri, "where's the party at?"
But that ain't got me anywhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Last call, answer, operator
I'm afraid I'm runnin' out of time
I know I sound broken but I just keep hopin'
For an open glowin' neon sign
Maybe this is crazy but I'm thinkin', baby
Maybe later you could meet me there
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk
Girl, you gotta get me there
I've tried the phone at the road
Mapped Siri, "where's the party at?"
But that ain't got me anywhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Out there's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Rolling down a long highway
Out through New Mexico
Drifting down to Santa Fe 
To ride a bull in a rodeo
He's hooked on a feelin'
Addicted to a natural high
Don't know why it's a feelin'
All he knows is he's got to ride
[Chorus]
He's addicted to danger
Rule out passion and pride
To pain and fear is no stranger
When his lust needs to be satisfied
Hooked on a eight-second ride
Getting up down in back of the chutes
Makes that rosin burn
Got his spurs on the heels of his boots
He's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate
He settles down inside
The tensions risin' but he can't wait 
'Till they turn that bull outside
[Chorus]
Hooked on a eight-second ride
Hooked on a eight-second ride
That old wind that's whipping out there 
It's whistlin' your tune 
That wind blew pyramids to Egypt 
And footprints to the moon 
And that old star that you been wishin' on 
Is shinin' mighty bright 
But it's the fire inside your heart 
That's gonna lead you to the light 
How you ever gonna know 
What it's like to live there 
How you ever gonna know victory 
How you ever gonna know 
What it's like when dreams become reality 
How you ever gonna know 
How it feels to hold her 
How you ever gonna know 
What it's like to dance 
How you ever gonna know 
If you never take a chance 
You know failure isn't failure 
If a lesson from it's learned 
I guess love would not be love 
Without a risk of being burned 
Anything in life worth havin' 
Lord, it has its sacrifice 
But the gift that you're receiving 
Is worth more than a price 
How you ever gonna know 
What it's like to live there 
How you ever gonna know 
What you never knew 
How you ever gonna know 
If you're down here doin' 
What the good Lord put you here to do 
How you ever gonna know 
If you could have done it 
How you ever gonna know 
How it feels to fly 
How you ever gonna know 
If you never dare to try 
Listen not to the critics 
Who put their own dreams on the shelf 
If you want to get the truth to admit it 
You gotta find out for yourself 
How you ever gonna know 
What it's like to be there 
How you ever gonna know 
If you're the best 
How you ever gonna know 
What you believe in 
If you don't put it to the test 
How you ever gonna know 
How it feels to hold him 
How you ever gonna know 
What livin' means 
How you ever gonna know 
If you never chase the dreams 
How you ever gonna know 
Your potential 
How you ever gonna know victory 
How you ever gonna know 
What it's like when dreams become reality 
How you ever gonna know 
How it feels to hold her 
How you ever gonna know 
What it's like to dance 
How you ever gonna know 
If you never take a chance
Drove to the church 
In my suit and tie 
But I just couldn't bring myself 
To go inside 
So I sat alone 
In my truck across the street 
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes 
By that long white limousine 
I could just imagine 
What was goin' on in there 
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass 
And those flowers in her hair 
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall 
Those bells rang loud as thunder 
As they opened up the doors 
Now I don't have to wonder anymore 
Laughin' and a cryin' 
Tossin' that bouquet 
And when you got in that limo 
I drove off the other way 
And I still don't know 
Why things happened like they did 
But I parked that old pickup 
On that lonesome river bridge 
I took your ring from my pocket 
And I held it one last time 
Watched that diamond sparkle 
I drew back and I let her fly 
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall 
Oh that old ring went under 
Lord and now it's gone for sure 
No and I don't have to wonder anymore 
Well the angels sang like thunder 
As I felt myself go under 
Now I don't have to wonder anymore
Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout you're plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before.
Between the two of us guys you know I love you more.
It took me by surprise I must say,
When I found out yesterday.
Don't you know

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine.
Oh I heard it through the grapevine,
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind.
Honey, honey yeah.
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby)

I know that a man ain't supposed to cry,
But these tears I can't hold inside.
'Cause losin' you would end my life you see,
'Cause you mean that much to me.
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else.
Instead

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine.
Oh I heard it through the grapevine,
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind.
Honey, honey yeah.
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby)

People say believe half of what you see,
Son, and none of what you hear.
But I can't help bein' confused
If it's true please tell me dear?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine.
Oh I heard it through the grapevine,
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind.
Honey, honey yeah.
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby)
(Yeah yeah yeah)

Honey honey I know (Heard it through the grapevine)
That you're letting me go (Not much longer would you be mine baby)
I heard it through the grapevine (Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby)
(Yeah yeah yeah)

(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
When all your loves have ended
When all your friends have flown
Who'll be around to want you
When all your loves have gone
Only a fool would do it
After the way you've done
And how many fools would have you
I know one
This fool keeps wondering why he fell in love at all
But you might need this fool around in case you fall
After the party's over and you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you...i know one
You never know you might be lonely when all your loves have missed
It wouldn't hurt to keep an extra fool on your list
After your heart's been broken and you need a place to run
If you'll take a fool who loves you...i know one...i know one
You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar, you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
You ain't no good (she's no good)
But oh, they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could

I guess that I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
Cause I ain't never (never)
I ain't never, (never)
I ain't never, no, no
Loved someone the way that I love you

Some time ago I thought
You had run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame (it's a shame)
How could ya hurt me so bad
When, you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had
Kiss me once again

Don'cha never, never say that we we're through
Cause I ain't never (never)
Never (never)
Never, no, no
Loved someone the way that I love you

I can't sleep at night
And I can't even fight
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me

Whoa, oh, oh
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

(One more time)
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

(Never never no no)
(Treat me this way)
(Never never never)
(This way. Never, never)
(No no, never never)
(No no, never never)
(No no, never)
She swears there's nothing wrong, but something's missing 
She's never been much good at telling lies 
'Cause you can hear the sound of leaving, if you listen 
This may be California, but Oklahoma's in her eyes 
I've got a good thing going 
It's plain to see she's tired of hanging on 
I've got a good thing going 
It's killing me that she's as good as gone 
By now she must be tired of always giving 
And tired of what she's getting in return 
I guess Oklahoma's more her style of living 
'Cause I can see her heart is heading 'cross a bridge I thought she'd burned 
I've got a good thing going 
It's plain to see she's tired of hanging on 
I've got a good thing going 
It's killing me that she's as good as gone 
Lord it's killing me that she's as good as gone
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance
To tell her how I feel
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes
In another's eyes
I'm someone who
Loves her enough
To walk away from you
I'd never cheat
And I would never lie
In another's eyes, yeah

In another's eyes
I can do no wrong
And he believes in me
And his faith is strong
I'd never fall
Or even compromise
In another's eyes

In another's eyes
I'm afraid that I can't see
This picture perfect portrait
That they paint of me
They don't realize
And I pray they never do
'Cause every time I look
I'm seein' you
In another's eyes

Whoa in another's eyes
Starin' back at me
I see a sinkin' soul
Tryin' desperately
To turn the tide
Before it dies
In another's eyes, yeah

And what they don't see
Lord is killing me
It's blessing and a curse
That love is blind

'Cause in another's eyes
I'm afraid that I can't see
This picture perfect portrait
That they paint of me
And they don't realize
And I pray to God they never do
'Cause every time I look
I'm seein' you
In another's eyes
She was a girl on a wagon train
Haded west across the plains
The train got lost in a summer storm
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home
Then she saw him ridin' through the rain
He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train
And she looked down and her heart was gone
The train went west but she stayed on
In Lonesome Dove

A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand
A blooming rose in a bed of sand
She loved the man who wore a star
A Texas Ranger known near and far
So they got married and they had a child
But times were touch and the West was wild
So it was no surprise the day she learned
That her Texas man would not return
To Lonesome Dove

Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove

She watched her boy grow into a man
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand
He wore his star for all to see
He was a Texas lawman legacy
The one day word blew into town
It seemed the men that shot his father down
Had robbed a bank in Cherico
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico
Was Lonesome Dove

The shadows stretched across the land
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street
The men lay at the ranger's feet
But legend tells to this very day
That shots were comin' from an alleyway
Though no one knows who held the gun
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone
In Lonesome Dove
Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove
They say mother earth is breathing
With each wave that finds the shore
Her soul rises in the evening
For to open twilight's door
Her eyes are the stars in heaven
Watching o'er us all the while
And her heart it is in Ireland
Deep within the Emerald Isle
We are forty against hundreds
In someone else's bloody war
We know not why were fighting
Or what we're dying for
They will storm us in the morning
When the sunlight turns to sky
Death is waiting for its dance now
Fate has sentenced us to die
Ireland I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green
And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand
I'm coming home Ireland
Oh the captain he lay bleeding
I can hear him calling me
These men are yours now for the leading
Show them to their destiny
As I look up all around me
I see the ragged tired and torn
I tell them to make ready
'Cause we're not waiting for the morn
Ireland I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green
And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand
I'm coming home Ireland
Now the fog is deep and heavy
As we forge the dark and fear
We can hear their horses breathing
As in silence we draw near
There are no words to be spoken
Just a look to say good-bye I draw a breath and night is broken
As I scream our battle cry
Ireland I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green
And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand
I'm coming home Ireland
Yes I am home Ireland
We were forty against hundreds
It don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
I know the sun is gonna rise
Shine down on another day
There will still be a tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
'Cause it don't matter to the sun (oh baby)
It matters to me
It ain't gonna stop the world
If you walk out that door
This old world will just keep on turning 'round (Turning 'round)
Like it did the day before
'Cause see to them it makes no difference (ohh)
It just keeps on keepin' time
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world (Oh baby)
But it'll be the end of mine
What can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
So without you...
(GuitarPiano solo)
Mmm mmm mmm, oh yeah, oh yeah
What can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
So without you
It don't matter the moon
If your not in my life
No the moon will just keep hangin' 'round (hangin' 'round)
Like it's just another night
Find another place to shine on down
On some other lovers dreams
'Cause it don't matter the moon (oh baby)
But is sure do matter to me
No it don't matter to the moon (oh baby)
But it matters to me
It's midnight Cinderella
But don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the Pumpkin Eater
And the party has just begun

I guess you're prince charming
Wasn't after all
'Cause he sure seemed different right after the ball
I guess that more than horses
Are turnin' into rats
And by the way he's walkin'
I can guess where your slippers at

It's midnight Cinderella
Time that you should know
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes
It's midnight Cinderella
But don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the pumpkin eater
And the party has just begun

It's midnight Cinderella
But don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the pumpkin eater
And the party has just begun
Standing in the spotlight
On such a perfect night
Knowing that your out there listening
I remember one time
When I was so afraid
Didn't think I had the courage
To stand up on this stage
Then you reached into my heart
And you found the melody
And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
It was you
It was you
It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
Every night I pray
Before the music starts to play
That I'll do my best and I won't let you down
And for all the times I've stood here
This feeling feels brand new
And any time I doubt myself I think of you
'Cause It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
Dreams can come true
With God's great angels like you
It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
It was your song
It's always been your song
It's the most wonderful time of the year 
With the kids jingle-belling 
And everyone telling you 
Be of good cheer 
It's the most wonderful time of the year 

It's the hap-happiest season of all 
With those holiday greetings 
And great happy meetings 
When friends come to call 
It's the hap-happiest season of all 

There'll be parties for hosting 
Marshmallows for roasting 
And caroling out in the snow 
There'll be scary ghost stories 
And tales of the glories 
Of Christmases long, long ago 

It's the most wonderful time of the year 
There'll be much mistletoe-ing 
And hearts will be glowing 
When loved ones are near 
It's the most wonderful time of the year

'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Ridin' down the road in her oldsmobile
Tappin on the floorboard bangin' on the wheel
Punchin' every button on the radio
But everything's too slow
Katie wants a fast one
Quicker than the last one
Only two times she gets that rush
Is makin' tracks and kickin' up dust
Katie wants a fast one you know she's gotta have one
Cause that's what makes her motor run
Katie wants a fast one
Tearin' up the yard on the ridin' mower
A neighbor yells Katie better go a little slower
Takin' every corner up on two wheels
Is how she gets her thrills
Chompin' at the bit in the checkout line
Katie's got a thing about wastin' time
If she pulls up behind you in the car pool lane
Just get out of her way
Katie wants a fast one
Quicker than the last one
Only two times she gets that rush
Is makin' tracks and kickin' up dust
Katie wants a fast one you know she's gotta have one
Cause that's what makes her motor run
Katie wants a fast one
Well, I don't know what my uncle did 
But he must have done it right 
They sure strung him up one Saturday night 
He had spent his whole life fussin' 
Would have spent his last breath cussin' 
'Til he realized the deal was really done 
He started screamin' "hallelujah" 
Tryin' to make his peace with everyone 
Yeah, he was kickin' and screamin' 
Just like he came in 
He was kickin' and screamin', darlin' 
Right to the bitter end 
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup 
And go out hollerin' whoa 
Lord, we never want to be here 
Sure don't ever want to go 
Well, I could hear those church bells ringin' 
To my best friend I was clingin' 
Screamin' "If you love me brother don't let me go" 
Well then the whole scene was repeated 
Two years later I begged and pleaded 
Screamin' "If you love me, honey, 
Now you know you wouldn't want to let me go" 
No, I didn't want to do it 
But I sure don't want to see it come undone 
Yeah, I was kickin' and screamin' 
Just like I came in 
I was kickin' and screamin', darlin' 
Right to the bitter end 
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup 
And go out hollerin' whoa 
Lord, we never want to be here 
Sure don't ever want to go 
Yeah, I was kickin' and screamin' 
Just like I came in 
I was kickin' and screamin', darlin' 
Right to the bitter end 
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup 
And go out hollerin' whoa 
Seems, we never want to be here 
Sure don't ever want to go
[Chorus]
Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
'Cause I dreamed the world
Had all agreed to put an end to war
I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the papers they were signing said
They'd never fight again
And when the papers were all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and they bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
And swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground
[Chorus]
Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please, swallow your pride
If you have things that you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show

You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

If there is a load
That you have to bear that you can't carry
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load
If you just call me

You gotta call me
Call me (If you need a friend)
Call me
Call me (Everybody just)
Call me
Call me
Call me
Call me
Call me (If you need a friend)
Call me
Call me
I burned my hand, I cut my face
Heaven knows how long it's been
Since I've felt so out of place
I'm wonderin' if I'll fit in

Debbie and Charley said they'd be here by nine
And Deb said she might bring a friend
Just my luck, they're right on time
So here I go again

I'm gonna smile my best smile
And I'm gonna laugh like it's going out of style
Look into her eyes and pray that she don't see
That learning to live again is killing me

Little cafe, table for four
But there's just conversation for three
And I like the way she let me get the door
And I wonder what she thinks of me

Debbie just whispered, "You're doin' fine"
And I wish that I felt the same
She's asked me to dance, now her hand's in mine
Oh, my God, I've forgotten her name

But I'm gonna smile my best smile
And I'm gonna laugh like it's going out of style
Look into her eyes and pray that she don't see
This learning to live again is killing me

Now here we are beneath her porch light
And I say what a great time it's been
A kiss on the cheek, a whisper goodnight
And I say, "can I see you again"

And she just smiles her best smile
And she laughs like it's going out of style
Looks into my eyes and says, "We'll see"
Oh this learning to live again is killing me
God this learning to live again is killing me
The weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Well, it doesn't show signs of stopping
But we've got some corn for popping
And the lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But as long as you hold me tight
Oh, all the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
But my dear we've still goodbye-ing
And as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But as long as you hold me tight
Oh, all the way home I'll be warm
Oh, the fire is slowly dying
But my dear we've still goodbye-ing
And as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
He was a hard-headed man
He was brutally handsome,
And she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
Of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, 'Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red."

Life in the fast lane
Surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane

Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people
They took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror
Lines on her face
She pretended not to notice
She was caught up in the race

Out every evening
Until it was light
He was too tired to make it
She was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane
Surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, yeah
Life in the fast lane
Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh huh

Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign,
Took a turn for the worse
She said, "Listen, baby.
You can hear the engine ring.
We've been up and down this highway
I haven't seen a goddam thing."
He said, "Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash."
"The doctor say he's comin', but you gotta pay him cash."
They went rushin' down that freeway,
Messed around and got lost
They didn't care they were just dyin' to get off and it was

Life in the fast lane
Surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, uh huh
Life in the fast lane
Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh huh

Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand

Hey barroom mirror on the wall
Go stare at someone else
Don't show the world the fool I am
Just keep it to yourself

Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand

Dance floor seems you're underneath my feet
Everywhere I turn
I oughta waltz right out of them swingin' doors
But that's a step I just can't learn

Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
There's no more waiting
Holding out for love
You are my Godsend
That I have been forever dreaming of
My angel from above
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in you
What is this feeling
I've never known before
That I should touch you
Swearing to surrender ever more
That's what I came here for
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in a wonderful daze
Lost in your wonderful ways
Heaven knows 
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in you
Hold on like there's no tomorrow.
There can be no sorrow,
Right here where we stand.
And living only for this moment
All we've ever wanted,
Is right here in our hands.
And some will say that we're sure to fall,
Try and build their walls between us. 
No way over it, no way around it. 
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.
Hold on till we see tomorrow,
There is time to borrow,
Till we own our own.
Walk on and our hearts will lead us.
But our hearts will need us,
To be steady and strong.
So we can stand and face the fire.
Burning higher and higher. 
No way over it, no way around it. 
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.
No: we know that a rainbow ends,
Beyond dark skies. 
No way over it, no way around it, no. 
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
An' the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.
Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
In the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a Rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days
One light blinking off and on
Blood of life in this town is gone
Lost all its pieces but the pawn
Tomorrow stopped coming with the dawn
In my dreams, I`ve seen
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen
When it`s over there`s no walking out
'cause I`ve been all they talk about
'cause what ain`t goin` down
On Main Street
I went too early with a friend of mine
Just to see what it was all about
Hit the freeway and it blew my mind,
I had to find a way of gettin` out
She said, they say, hey you gotta live a little
In my mind, I`d find lost ain`t living,
Even there in the middle of Main Street 
Yeah....
Never did the things I though I would
Woulda left just didn`t know I could
If things don`t work like they should
It ain`t for better but it`s for good
'cause in my dreams I`ve seen
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen
When it`s over there`s no walking out
'cause I`ve been all they talk about
'cause what ain`t goin` down
In my dreams I`ve seen
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen
When it`s over there`s no walking out
'cause I`ve been all they talk about
'cause what ain`t goin` down
On Main Street
Papa
They're waiting just outside my door
This is where I make make my stand
'Cause I can't stand it anymore

Papa
They have no heart and soul
But make no doubt about it
They're the ones that's in control
So prepare yourself for a war unlike you've ever seen
This is man against machine

(Work, Work, Work)

Day in day out
Bust your back and turn it out
Next morning and do it all again
Hard job or two
So your children won't have to
That's just the way its always been
But lately I swear the machines
Are living the American dream

Careful calculations
Details drawn down to design
Is it really for the better or a better bottom line
Don't know me from Adam
Man it's rotten to the core
Strongly get reminded man has kicked its ass before
John Henry's about to show on the scene
In this war of man against machine
Work
Work
Work
Work

Up early up hills
Spend your youth to pay the bills
Each generation makes a trade
Top floor brass tacks
Holds the hand that holds the ax
Acts like my dues have not been paid
But pay attention now when I say
Full automation isn't happening today

Careful calculations
Details drawn down to design
Is it really for the better or a better bottom line
You don't know me from Adam and it's rotten to the core
It's gonna get reminded man has kicked its ass before
John Henry's about to blow off some steam
In this war of man against the machine
Work
Work
Work
Work
Work
Work

Papa
The power's off, the machines are down
In this world of darkness
I can still hear a sound

Papa
That sound tears us apart
'Cause I'm a machine myself
But I am one with a working heart

Careful calculations
Details drawn down to design
Is it really for the better or a better bottom line
Don't know me from Adam
Man it's rotten to the core
It's gonna get reminded man has kicked its ass before
The gloves are off, no love lost between
In this war of man against the machine
Work
Work
Work
Work
Against the machine
Work

It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year round
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
All the world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes, whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
So get out and push it along
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter, it's a marshmallow world
Yeah, it's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year round
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
All the world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes, whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
So get out and roll it along
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
You're my sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter, it's a marshmallow world
In winter, it's a marshmallow world
Mary Had A Little Lamb
One Holy Morning
Neath The Star Of Bethlehem
A Brand New Day Was Forming
Guided By The Shining Light
And The Angel's Voice
Wise Men Traveled Through The Night
To See The Baby Boy
[Chorus:]
Cause Mary Had A Little Lamb
King Of Kings And Son Of Man
Mary Had A Little lamb Of God
They Gathered Round To See The Lamb
In The Manger Sleeping
Such A Humble Throne For Him
The Promise Of God Was Keeping
There The Shepherds Bowed Their Heads
Among The Cattle Lowing
The First Ever Christmas Gift
Was Wrapped In Swaddling Clothes
(Chorus)
For The World A Sacrifice
Mary Did Give Birth
The Way She Held Him In Her Arms
Is How He Holds The Earth
Yesterday the odds were stacked in favor of my expectations
Flyin' above the rest, never fallin' from the nest
Tuesday came and went and I'm in a little situation
Maybe it's for the best, I could live alone, I guess
Maybe I could stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe she'll fly on home
Excuse me if I'm keeping you apart from better conversation
Hung up on all my doubt, trying to sort the whole thing out
Tell me that I'm smart enough to deal with all the information
Spinning inside my head, every word she ever said
Maybe I could stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe she'll fly on home
Maybe I could stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe she'll fly on home
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe she'll fly on home
I know you don't know me
Only our eyes have met
But what yours are saying
Is making me sweat
The dance floor is empty
Why don't you meet me in love
Your breath on my body
The touch of your skin
Your touch is ungodly
And way beyond sin
I've fallen so deeply
Beggin' you meet me in love
Darling please meet me
And I'll whisper sweetly
You're the one
All my life
That I've dreamed of
I've fallen so deeply
I'm yours completely
So darling please meet me forever in love
Lips warm and tender
Ask if I'll always care
Simply surrender
And follow me there
Trust me completely
Darling please meet me in love
Darling please meet me
Ever so sweetly in love
Well, I've got to run to keep from hidin'
And I'm bound to keep on ridin'
And I've got one more silver dollar

But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
And I've got one more silver dollar

But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

And I've gone by the point of caring
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
And I've got one more silver dollar

But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
But they don't realize

Is when your dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone.
Driving cross town just to see if she's home.
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be alright.
When your finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be there in your dreams.
That's when she's
More than a memory

Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all the pictures off the wall
But that ain't helping me at all.

'Cause when your talking out loud and nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinking more than you've ever drank
Sinking down lower than you've ever sank
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees,
Praying to God, begging him please
That's when she's
More than a memory

She's more
She's more

'Cause when your dialing her number just to hang up the phone
Driving cross town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be alright
When our finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be waiting in your dreams
That's when she's
More than a memory

People say she's only in my head
Its gonna take time but I'll forget
Our guardian star lost all his glow
The day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said, "no"
And his grey skies turned to blue
Like him I am doubtful that your love is true
So if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mister Blue
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me
Then prove it by goin' out on the sly
Provin' your love is untrue
Call me Mr. Blue
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry
Then turn around headed for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue
I sleep alone each night
Wait by the phone each night
But you don't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me mister "I won't tell you"
When you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue

I sleep alone each night
Wait by the phone each night
But you don't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me mister "I won't tell you"
When you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mister
Rain on the room and time on my hands
It sure seemed quiet out there in radio land
They call me at the all-night station
Make their special dedications
And I do my best to play their request
When it's a desperate situation
This was a desperate situation
I'm Mr. Midnight alone and blue
The brokenhearted call me up
When they don't know what else to do
Every song is a reminder of the love that they once knew
I'm Mr. Midnight, can I play a song for you
"Caller on the line could you please hold on?"
I recognized her voice the minute i picked up the phone
Should I tell her that it's me or leave it at a memory
Haven't been myself since the day she left
And I'm never gonna be
I'm forever gonna be
I'm Mr. Midnight alone and blue
The brokenhearted call me up
When they don't know what else to do
Every song is a reminder of the love that they once knew
I'm Mr. Midnight, can I play a song for you
Imagine my surprise when she spoke my name
She said, "Could you tell him that I love him
and I wish things could be the same."
Then a voice I never knew
Said, "Honey who you talking to?"
I'm Mr. Midnight alone and blue
The brokenhearted call me up
When they don't know what else to do
Every song is a reminder of the love that they once knew
I'm Mr. Midnight, can I play a song for you
I can tell by the way you been turnin' men down
Not your ordinary guy is gonna do 
you've been waitin' for that someone 
Who can turn your head around 
Well now honey, I`m that special one for you
[Chorus]
There must be a million fish out in that ocean
So you must find the one that's right for you somehow
Well its up to you I'm here for years 
Or till the night time disappears 
I'm Mr. Right or Mr. Right now 
And if you choose to be my wife 
I would love you all my life 
I`d do everything your precious heart allowed
Or we could make love love all night long 
And in the morning I`d be gone 
I`m Mr. Right or Mr. Right now 
[Chorus]
 
I`m Mr. Right forever or just until whenever
Mr. Right or Mr. Right now
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,
Jesus loves you more than you will know.
Woah, woah, woah
God bless you, please Mrs. Robinson.
Heaven holds a place for those who pray,
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

We'd like to know a little bit about your for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself.
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes,
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home.

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,
Jesus loves you more than you will know.
Woah, woah, woah
God bless you, please Mrs. Robinson.
Heaven holds a place for those who pray,
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Hide it in the hiding place where no one ever goes.
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes.
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair.
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids.

Koo-koo-ka-choo, Mrs. Robinson,
Jesus loves you more than you will know.
Woah, woah, woah
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson.
Heaven holds a place for those who pray,
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon.
Going to the candidate's debate.
Laugh about it, shout about it
But when you've got to choose
Every way you look at this you lose.

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio,
The nation turns it's lonely eyes to you.
Woo, woo, woo
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson.
Jotting Joe has left and gone away,
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
This ol' highway's getting longer 
Seems there ain't no end in sight 
To sleep would be best, but I just can't afford to rest 
I've got to ride in Denver tomorrow night 
I called the house but no one answered 
For the last two weeks no one's been home 
I guess she's through with me, to tell the truth I just can't see 
What's kept the woman holding on this long 
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold 
I'm much too young to feel this damn old 
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole 
I'm much too young to feel this damn old 
The competition's getting younger 
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall 
The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze 
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all 
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold 
I'm much too young to feel this damn old 
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole 
I'm much too young to feel this damn old 
Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old
She use to be my rosa amarilla
My little Mexicali tomatilla
But then one night I drank too much sangria
Woke up and found a note that said I'll see ya
(Chorus)
Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more
My baby no esta aqui no more
She left me here with nada
Broke my heart like a pinata
My baby no esta aqui no more
Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her
Please, please tell her that I need her
I used to be her number one vaquero
Her numero uno caballero
But I've had to hock my spurs and my sombrero
'Cause when she left she took all my dinero
(Repeat Chorus)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her
Please, please tell her that I need her
Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more
My baby no esta aqui no more
she left me here with nada
Broke my heart like a pinata
My baby no esta aqui
My baby no esta aqui
My baby no esta aqui no more
You don't have to cry when I say goodbye, goodbye
You know I'll be coming back real soon 
And when I do, you know
It will be such a sweet hello
Rising like the sun above the sky line, sky line
Love is brighter than ever before
And that should be understood
When I said "I do," you knew I would
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Two hearts can be one together
My love tells me so
Let me lay your head upon my pillow, baby
Whisper what you need to me, my dear (my dear)
Don't worry, close your eyes 
Morning will find me by your side
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Two hearts can be one together
My love tells me so
Give me a chance and I'll sing for you
I have a song for you 
To be with you is a dream
I dream of you
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Like birds on a high lane
They line up at night time at the bar
They all once were lovebirds
Now bluebirds are all that they are
They landed in hell
The minute they fell from love's sky
And now they hope in the wine
That they'll find a new way to fly
A new way to fly
Far away from goodbye
Above the clouds and the rain
The memories and the pain
And the tears that they cry
Now the lesson's been learned
They've all crashed and burned
But they can leave it behind
If they could just find
A new way to fly
By the end of the night
They'll be high as a kite once again
And they don't seem to mind all the time
Or the money they spend
It's a high price to pay
To just find a way to get by
But it's worth every dime
If they find a new way to fly
A new way to fly
Far away from goodbye
Above the clouds and the rain
The memories and the pain
And the tears that they cry
Now the lesson's been learned
They've all crashed and burned
But they can leave it behind
If they could just find
A new way to fly
They'll leave it behind
As soon as they find
A new way to fly
One night when I was out ridin'
The graveyard shift, midnight till dawn
The moon was bright, as a readin' light
With a letter from an old friend back home
And he asked me, "Why do you ride for your money? Tell me, why do you rope for short pay?
You ain't a gettin' nowhere and you're losin' your share.
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there."
He said, "Last night, I ran on to Jenny. She's married and she has a good life.
Boy, you sure missed the track, when you never came back.
She's the perfect professional's wife.
And she asked me, 'Why does he ride for his money? Tell me, why does he rope for short pay?
He ain't a gettin' nowhere, and he's losin' his share.
Boy, he must have gone crazy out there.' "
Ah, but they've never seen the Northern Lights
They've never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring at the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole Camp Cookie sing 
So I read up the last of my letter
And I tore off the stamp for Black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and he grinned
And he said, "Now why do they ride for their money? Tell me, why do they ride for short pay?
They ain't a gettin' nowhere and they're losin' their share
Boy, they must have gone crazy out there
Son, they all must be crazy out there."
Nobody gets off in this town
Trains don't even slow down
My high school sweetheart's married and gone
They met on a bus to San Antone
They Greyhound stops!  
Somebody gets on
But nobody gets off in this town
Nobody gets off in this town
Old folks 'round here wear a frown
Now let me see if I can set the scene
It's a one-dog town and he's old and mean
There's one stop light but it's always green
Nobody gets off in this town
Nobody gets off in this town
High school colors are brown
They can't drag Main because it kicks up dust
Their cars and their dreams area all starting to rust
The high school dances are always a bust
Nobody gets off in this 
Nobody gets off in this town
They oughta just tear it down
'Cause in the winter you freeze and in the summer you fry
Utility bill's the only thing that gets high
I'd go for a drink but this county is dry
Nobody gets off
Nobody gets off
Nobody gets off in this square old merry-go-round
No, nobody gets off in this town
O little town of Bethlehem 
How still we see thee lie 
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
The silent stars go by 
Yet in they dark streets shineth 
The everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years 
Are met in thee tonight 
O holy child of Bethlehem 
Descend to us we pray 
Cast out our sins and enter in 
Be born to us today 
O morning starts together 
Proclaim thy holy birth 
And praises sing to God the king 
And peace to men on earth 
O hear thy sacred angels 
As faith holds wide the door 
Then darkness wakes, the glory breaks 
As Christmas comes once more
There's not a lot of things to do
I wouldn't rather do with you
Guess I'm funny that way
Lately I just sit and stare
I talk to people who aren't there
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step away
From leavin' you behind
I sit up with the radio
Sing along with the ones I know
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step away
From leavin' you behind
I'm callin' every friend I've had
Wake 'em up, and make 'em mad
Let 'em know that I'm OK
I used to sit and talk to you
They're all just a substitute
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step away
From leavin' you behind
I stay up with the late, late show
Just another way I know
To get through one night a day
To get through one night a day
Operator, well could you help me place this call
See, the number on the match book is old and faded
She's living in L.A
With my best old ex-friend Ray
A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated

But isn't that the way they say it goes
Well let's forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine, and to show
I've overcome the blow
I've learned to take it well
I only wish my words
Could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels

Operator, well could you help me place this call
'Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me
There's something in my eyes
You know it happens every time
I think about the love that I thought would save me

But isn't that the way they say it goes
Well let's forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine, and to show
I've overcome the blow
I've learned to take it well
I only wish my words
Could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels
No, no, no, no
That's not the way it feels

Operator, well let's forget about this call
There's no one there I really wanted to talk to
Thank you for your time
Ah, you've been so much more then kind
You can keep the dime

But isn't that the way they say it goes
Well let's forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine, and to show
I've overcome the blow
I've learned to take it well
I only wish my words
Could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels
Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the being alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
When Daddy'd hang up then she was gone again
Mama was a looker
Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town
Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes when he was shifting gears
Mama was a looker
Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen
[Chorus]
Please operator could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinking
Which dirty beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
No need to describe me
'Cause I ain't all here
She told me to get lost
And that's what I did
But I've done it so well
I don't know where I hid
And she swore that she never will see me again
Hell I'll never find me
In the shape that I'm in
[Chorus]
Now I had to ask myself
If I were me
And I was out drinking
Well where would I be
Then I thumb nailed the label
And there I appeared
Hiding out in a bottle
Behind a three-day old beard
[Chorus]
Well I may be lonely
But I'm never alone
Cause I've been beside myself
Since she's been gone
Oh, please operator could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinking
Which dirty beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
And if he can find me
I'll buy him a beer
Please operator could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinking
Which filthy beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
I'll be beside myself
Pouring down beer
There's a storm that is coming
Everyone is running away
But you hear a different drummer drumming
You've waited your whole life for this one day
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Time to unleash the beast inside
Time to show the world what you are all about
Now, it's kickin' in, pure adrenaline
No one's ever been where you're standin'
Of the multitudes, God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline
There's a long stretch of highway
And you know that's where they're makin' their move 
You could pass on some forgotten byway
But you're young and you've got something to prove
Don't want to run, don't want to hide
Time to unleash the beast inside
Time to show them all what you are all about
Now, it's kickin' in, pure adrenaline
No one's ever been where you're standin'
Of the multitudes, God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline
Time for lift off so you better be ready to dance
Fate's done pissed off
Gonna kill you if you give him a chance
Now, it's kickin' in, pure adrenaline
No one's ever been where you're standin'
Of the multitudes, God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline 
Pure adrenaline, pure adrenaline, pure adrenaline
Time to dial it in
Pure adrenaline
Sometimes I tell you the way that I feel
I swear that I'm going crazy
Keep telling myself it ain't that big a deal
It's better than pushing up daisies
I felt the arrow from death's fatal quiver
Come so close it actually grazed me
I bled the blood and I felt the cold shiver
God only knows how he saved me
There's two dates in time that they'll carve on your stone
And everyone knows what they mean
What's more important is the time that is known
And that little dash there in between
That little dash there in between
Sometimes my hear is as true as a dove
But sometimes my heart it betrays me
So I draw my sword for to fight for my love
But without a whisper she slays me
My mother died but somehow she keeps living
She'll never cease to amaze me
My dad turns his back on each day that he's given
'Cause he'd rather be pushing up daisies
There's two dates in time that they'll carve on your stone
And everyone knows what they mean
What's more important is the time that is known
And that little dash there in between
Yeah, that little dash there in between

Maybe it's the high schools, maybe it's the teachers
Tattoos, pipe bombs underneath the bleachers
Maybe it's the music, maybe it's the crack
Maybe it's the bible, or could it be the lack

Everybody get together
Try to love one another, right now...right now

Okay, maybe it's the papers, maybe it's the family

Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
You gotta love one another

Maybe it's the fallout, maybe it's the ozone
Maybe it's the chemicals, the radiation, cell phones

Lotteries, fast food, bad news, road rage

It ain't gonna get better)

We gotta love one another

Maybe it's a fashion, maybe it's a trend
Maybe it's the future... maybe it's the end
His eyes are cold and restless
And His wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas
Just to change the way he feels
'Cause she knows his love's in Tulsa
And she knows he's gonna go
But it ain't no woman flesh and blood
It's that damned old rodeo

Well  it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in his buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

She does her best to hold him
When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall
And it's "So long girl, I'll see you."
When it's time for him to go
You know the woman wants her cowboy

It'll drive the man insane

Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'

She was born to a mother trucker
Raised behind the wheel
So you can blame it on the highway
For the way she can't sit still
She says life is like a windshield
It ain't no rear view mirror
The only way to get where you're goin'
Is find that higher gear
And keep it
Rollin'
Life's gonna run you over if you don't get goin'
She said I want to fell the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
Oh I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You got to keep it
Rollin'
Well I knew that I was in trouble
When she told me that talk was cheap
Said if you're tired get on the sofa
'Cause the bed's no place to sleep
Then she reached down and she kissed
Lord it knocked me to my knees
And I knew if I was gonna get naked
I was gonna have to roll up my sleeves
And keep it
Rollin'
Love was gonna run me over if I didn't get it goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
Boy I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You got to keep it
Rollin'
So I talked her into gettin' married
But she wouldn't hang up her wheels
I was afraid I'd take a back seat
To the way the highway feels
But each day she's pullin' over
More than she used to
She knows love is like the highway
The main thing you gotta do
Is keep it
Rollin'
Life's gonna run you over if you don't get goin'
She said I want to fell the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
Oh I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You got to keep it
Rollin'
Life's gonna run you over if you don't get goin'
She said I want to fell the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
Oh I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You got to keep it
Rollin'
While they dance
How she holds him
Pulls him close
And loves him so
While he dreams of another
And counts the days
Until he lets her go

Same old story
That everybody knows
It's one heart holdin' on
One letting go

While they ride
Lord, he tells her
How they two
Will settle down
But she only hears the highway
And a voice
In some other town

And the harder
He holds her
The more she slips away

Same old story
That everybody knows
It's one heart holdin' on
And one letting go
Same old story
Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl, Santa baby 
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed 
Next year I could be just as good
If you'd check off my Christmas list
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot (a lot)
Been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me too
Santa cutie, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean a phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry
Well I'm shameless
When it comes to loving you,
I'll do anything you want me to,
I'll do anything at all

And I'm standing
Here for all the world to see,
Oh, baby that's what's left of me,
I don't have very far to fall

You know now I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been living in
I don't break easy, I have my pride,
But if you need to be satisfied

I'm shameless
Honey, I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standing there
I go down upon my knees

And I'm changing,
Swore I'd never compromise,
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise
I'll do anything you need

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew,
But I can't walk away from you

I have never had anything have this much control on me
I've worked too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world, and it's worked so perfectly,
But it sure won't now, I can't refuse,
I've never had so much to lose
And I'm shameless

You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I ever missed,
But I've never been in love like this
It's out of my hands

I'm shameless
I don't have the power now,
I don't want it anyhow,
So I gotta let it go

Oh I'm shameless
Shameless as a man can be
You could make a total fool of me
I just wanted you to know
That I'm shameless

I just wanted you to know
Oh I'm shameless

I'm down on my knees
Shameless

You said
I feel shameless
She's sun and rain, she's fire and ice
A little crazy but it's nice
And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone
'Cause she'll rage just like a river
Then she'll beg you to forgive her
She's every woman that I've ever known

She's so New York and then L.A.
And every town along the way
She's every place that I've never been
She's making love on rainy nights
She's a stroll through Christmas lights
And she's everything I want to do again

It needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

No it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

She's anything but typical
She's so unpredictable
Oh but even at her worst she ain't that bad
She's as real as real can be
And she's every fantasy
Lord she's every lover that I've ever had
And she's every lover that I've never had

Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds, quake at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah

City sidewalks,
Busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a
Feeling like Christmas
Children laughing,
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every
Street corner you hear
Silver bells,
Silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling,
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all the
Bustle you hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch them roll away again, yeah
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
Yeah I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothing's gonna come my way
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
Looks like nothing's ever gonna change
Why must everything remain the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Sittin' at the dock of a bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling 
Ring-ting-tingling too 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 
Outside the snow is falling 
And friends are calling yoo-hoo 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 
Our cheeks are nice and rosy 
And comfy cozy are we 
We're snuggling close together 
Like two birds of a feather should be 
Let's take the road before us 
And sing a chorus or two 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 
There's a birthday party 
At the house of farmer Gray 
It'll be the perfect ending 
To the perfect day 
We'll be singing the songs 
We love to sing 
Without a single stop 
At the fireplace where 
We'll watch the chestnuts pop 
There's a happy feeling 
Nothing in the world can buy 
When they pass around the coffee 
And the pumpkin pie 
It'll nearly be like a picture print 
By Currier and Ives 
These wonderful things are the things 
We remember all through our lives
Love was burning like the summer
We were lost in one another
Holding on, holding on
We could not escape the heat
Love was dangerous but sweet
And it was strong
Now you're talking 'bout your freedom
What is that you say?
You suddenly declared to me
Your independence day
Caught me by surprise
Fog turning to ice
Well it ain't even cold, baby
How could it snow in July?
Well, you led me to believe that
You found everything you needed
In my arms for so long
I thought everything was fine
Now you're turning on a dime
And moving on, moving on
Now I should have brought my sweater
For a chill is in the air
There's a sudden change of weather
For which I am not prepared
Caught me by surprise
Fog turning to ice
Well it ain't even cold, baby
How could it snow in July?
Well, I should have brought my sweater
For a chill is in the air

Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief,
Lord! Somebody (somebody)
Ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard)
Every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
My hard earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees and I praise the lord
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody, somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

(He works hard) Everyday (everyday)
And I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down they say
He's goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Somebody, please somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love? (can)

(Anybody find me somebody to love?)

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm ok, I'm alright
(He's alright he's alright)
Ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

She wants something with a ring to it
Like a church bell makes
Like a pretty white gown to wear
And some vows to take
She wants something with a ring to it
I think I understand
Gonna have to put a ring on her finger
If I'm gonna be her man
My baby's playin' hard to please
And I think I figured out
What it is she wants from me
'Cause when I hold her close
When we go out at night
I can hardly see the moonlight
For the diamonds in her eyes
She wants something with a ring to it
Like a church bell makes
Like a pretty white gown to wear
And some vows to take
She wants something with a ring to it

Gonna have to put a ring on her finger
If I'm gonna be her man
My baby did but now she don't
And if I don't say I do
It's a safe bet that she won't
Love me like she used to
When our love first began
Now the only way to change her tune
Is with a wedding band
She wants something with a ring to it
Like a church bell makes
Like a pretty white gown to wear
And some vows to take
She wants something with a ring to it
I think I understand
Gonna have to put a ring on her finger
If I'm gonna be her man
He could see the storm clouds rollin' across the hill
He barely beat the rain in from the field
And between the backdoor slammin' she heard him say
"Damn this rain and damn this wasted day"
But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh so long
She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while
When their eyes met, they both began to smile

Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to know you care
She wants to know she's needed
She needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night

They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket
On the front porch swing
He'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things
And there are times she feels alone even by his side
It was the first time she ever saw him cry

Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to know you care
She wants to know she's needed
She needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night

To know she's needed
She needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night
Honey I know you got a good job
Out there making all that dough
They keep late working that overtime
And I don't ever see you no more
Guess your not checking your message machine
Seem like your never in
Oh but I got a hunch, if we can just do lunch
I can get your attention again
I know you got your schedule and your keeping it tight
You got something going morning noon and night
But I got something here I think your gonna like
Honey can you squeeze me in
Who ever said it's a mans world
Don't know what he's talking about
You got me working around the clock
Honey trying to figure you out
I know time is money
There's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You gotta make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in
I got it circled in red on the calendar, baby
You told me that tonight's the night
I've got the Champaign chilled
I've got a gourmet meal, soft music and candlelight
I try to get you on the phone and I get stuck on hold
I guess you keep getting sidetracked
I've been faxing you love notes all day long
I know you got your schedule and your keeping it tight
You got something going morning noon and night
But I got something here I think your gonna like
Honey can you squeeze me in
Who ever said it's a mans world
Sure knows what he's talking about
You got me working around the clock

Let's make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh just stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky we look upon
Should ever tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me

So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh won't you stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me, oh stand now,
Stand by me, stand by me
We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk it the tables being turned

We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always come with getting burned

But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all

They're so hell bent on giving, walking a wire
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

There's this love that is burning
Deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

The words fall out my mouth
And onto the floor
I'm needing yeah
To pack up my bags and walk right out the door

This is goodbye
I'll roll the windows down
My old Chevrolet
Don't know where I'm going
I just know that I can't stay

Might make it to Memphis
That ain't far enough
I speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missouri
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burning your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind

I'm thinking
With a truck stop song and a cold cup of coffee
I'm drinking
Yeah I'm hurting like hell
But honey how could I not be
You make me
Oh the joker, the fool
The last one to know so I'm gonna put
Mountains and deserts and rivers between us
Go as far as I can go

I'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missouri
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burning your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind

Might be some tears in Topeka
A couple of sleepless nights in Cheyenne
And the time that I miss you babe
I'll hit the gas as fast as I can

Might make it to Memphis
The Kansas City line
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind
Yeah, my bills are all due and the baby needs shoes but I'm busted
Cotton is down, quarter a pound but I'm busted, oh yeah
I got cow that went dry, hen that won't lay
Big stack of bills gettin' bigger each day
County's gonna haul my name, know that I went and I'm busted, I am, yeah
Well, I went to my brother to ask for a loan 'cause I was busted
But I hate to beg like a dog for a bone but I'm busted
But my brother said, "There ain't a thing I can do
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu
I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted"
And I am no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone and I'm busted, no, no, no
Well, the fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow
And my family and I had to pack up and go
I'll make a living, my Lord, how I don't know 'cause I'm busted
They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way
I found more clouds of gray
Than any Broadway play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall, and get that way
Hi ho alas and also lack a day
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

Butterfly, do you ever get to stay?

Can I sleep in your arms, tonight, lady?
It's so cold lyin' here all alone.
An' I have no hold to hold on you.
An', I assure you, I'll do you no wrong.
Don't know why, but the one I love left me.
Left me lonely an' cold an' so weak.
And I need someone's arms to hold me.
Till I'm strong enough to get back on my feet.
Can I sleep in your arms, tonight, lady?
It's so cold lyin' here all alone.
An' I have no hold to hold on you.

And my heart fell at your feet
An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side,
And he looked so satisfied
An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing,
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
An' suddenly, I got that old time feeling
An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you,
And hold you just the way I used to do
Heaven only knows how much I miss you
And I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Have you ever been down to Haiti, when
The summer sun was sinkin' low
There's nothin' but romance, just everywhere you glance
And the native hearts are all a-glow
But when the Cuban Queen comes upon the scene
They all stare like a statue out of stone
And when they realize what's before their eyes
The other girls are left all alone.
Down in the Caribbean, it's not a dream you're seein'
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm
But from miles away you can see her sway
To the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms.
Up in a tree so high, way up in the sky
Sits a wide-eyed monkey on a limb
He wonders why the people go to so much trouble
Just to try to be like him
He doesn't understand, that it's a lady's hand
That makes a heart feel so sublime
But before too long, he starts singing the song
And then he gets in the Conga line.
Columbus searched for spices, but he missed the nicest
Part of the Caribbean
He didn't see the charms and the open arms
It was the gold that he was seein'
Oh, but I'm glad he missed, the sweetest thing I've kissed
'Cause we're on our honeymoon
I'm so sorry Chris, to talk about you like this
But you were five-hundred years too soon.
Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.
Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!
Lord! she said, casey can you only stay a while? 
Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the golden crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.
Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,
Now she said, now that you've a fam'ly of your own;
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body!
Lord! she said casey it's a shame to be alone!
There's a bird in the sky 
Flying high, flying high
To a place from a place 
Changing skies, changing skies
There are clouds in the sky 
Clouds of fear and despair
But love like ours never dies 
Changing skies, changing skies
Little bird have you heard 
Freedom lies, freedom lies
But love like ours never dies 
Just changing skies, changing skies
One night when the moon was bright on the moonlit bay
That is where I found my little Cherokee maid
The memory of the that night of love is lingering yet
And I know I never will forget
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so
And though we're far apart
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her
For anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee Maiden and me
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so
And though we're far apart
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her
For anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise

And though we're far apart
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her

Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee Maiden and me
It was Christmas in prison and the food was real good
We has turkey and pistols carved out of wood
I dream of her always even when I don't dream
Her name's on my tongue and her blood's in my strings
Wait a while eternity
Old Mother Nature's got nothin' on me
Come to me, run to me, come to me now
I'm rollin' my sweetheart
I'm flowin' by God
She reminds me of a chess game with someone I admire
Or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire
Her heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail
And she's sweeter than saccharine at a drug store sale
Wait a while eternity
Old Mother Nature's got nothin' on me
Come to me, run to me, come to me now
I'm rollin' my sweetheart
I'm flowin' by God
The search light in the big yard turns 'round with the gun
And spotlights the snowflakes like the dust in the sun
It's Christmas in prison there'll be music tonight
I'll probably get homesick, I love you, Good night
Wait a while eternity
Old Mother Nature's got nothin' on me
Come to me, run to me, come to me now
I'm rollin' my sweetheart
I'm flowin' by God

A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the nighT
For lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks
Their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself
In the glow of city lights
Lights that say "forget her name
In a glass of cherry wine"
Lights that offer other girls 
For empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture
Of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness
Behind those city lights
The world was dark and God made stars
To brighten up the night
But the God who put the stars above
I don't believe he made those lights
For it's just a place for men to cry
When things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away
And hide behind those city lights
Lights that say "forget her love
In a different athmosphere"
Lights that lure are nothing
But a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture
But my arms can't hold her tight
I just can't say "I love you"
To a street of city lights
I just can't say "I love you"
To a street of city lights
Riding on the city of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulled out at Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
And freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles
Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman Porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rail is all they feel
Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Nighttime on the city of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues
Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Everybody's got a place they go
When the old battery gets running low
I'm a sucker for the sand and sea, yea
If I had my way, hey I'd always be

Way up high in a coconut tree
Layin' low, just my baby and me
Sunny skies as far as I can see
High up in a coconut tree

Not to green, not too brown
I shimmy up and I shake the good ones down
Coconuts, a couple of bucks a piece
And you can do alright if you ain't afraid to be

High in a coconut tree
Layin' low, just my baby and me
Sunny skies as far as I can see
High in a coconut tree

Yeah, there's less stress and the world's alright
It's a different point of view
When you're looking at life

Way up high in a coconut tree
(Layin' low) low, just my baby and me
Sunny skies as far as I can see
High up in a coconut

High in a coconut tree

Sunny skies as far as I can see
High up in a coconut tree
Up here with Willie
Sunny skies as far as I can see
Let's get high in a coconut tree
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
And deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true
If you let me, ooh

You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
Now won't that be fine?

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
And deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

Well, I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
Yeah, but don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true
If you let me, if you let me

Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
Now won't that be fine?

Now days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always, yeah honey
I'm with you always

I am with you always
I'm with you, baby
Rain or shine
Come on back Jesus (come on back Jesus)
Come on back Jesus
And pick up John Wayne on the way
The world's done gone crazy,
And it seems to get worse everyday
So come on back Jesus,
And pick up John Wayne on the way
Time to take off the gloves
They just don't respect peace anymore
But if we have old John Wayne
We know he can swing from the floor
While he kicks their butts
We'll just stand there and watch him and pray
So come on back Jesus,
And pick up John Wayne on the way
Come on back Jesus (come on back Jesus)
Come on back Jesus
And pick up John Wayne on the way
The world's gettin' crazy,
And it seems to get worse everyday
So come on back Jesus,
And pick up John Wayne on the way
It's getting real hairy
If only old duke man was here
He'd call me old bastard
From out past the atmosphere
Lord the news looked so scary
When I glanced at the paper today
So come on back Jesus,
And pick up John Wayne on the way
Come on back Jesus (come on back Jesus)
Come on back Jesus
And pick up John Wayne on the way
The world's gettin' crazy,
And it seems to get worse everyday
So come on back Jesus,
And pick up John Wayne on the way
Come on back Jesus, come on back Jesus
Come on back Jesus
And pick up John Wayne on the way
I can hear the wind blowing in my mind
Just the way it used to do through the Georgia pines
And you were there to answer when I called
You and me, Lord knows, we had it all
Remember how I used to touch your hair, baby
Looking for the feeling, it was always there
You're the best thing in my life I can recall
Yeah baby, you and me, we had it all
I know that we can never live those times again
And I get old feelings that I'll be there back again
And I'll stay with you girl just as long as I can
'Cause it was so good, oh, it was so good, you know
Yes, it was so good when I was your man
And I'll never stop believing in your smile
Even though, you didn't stay, it was all worth while
And I know that beneath of it all, baby
Just you and me, we had it all
You and me, we had it all
You and me, we had it all
There's a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor
He thinks he's Hank Williamshear him singing through the door
There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through
And for one thing or another, committed to Parkview
There's a girl in 307, coming down on Thorazine
And a superstar's ex-drummer trying to kick Benzedrine
There's a boy just down below me, who's the son of some well-known
He was brought in by his mother, 'cause his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on Broadway and a few quite well-to-do's
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview
There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning, an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good choosing some committed to Parkview
They wake us about 6:30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And I always say "Fantastic! There ain't nothing wrong with me."
And then they give me my injection and I go right back to sleep
And my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too
But they're taking good care of me committed to Parkview
I can tell that you're already growing tired of me
You want no part of me even started lying to me
And if you started out to break this heart inside of me
Congratulations to you dear you're doing fine.
I pass you on the street and you don't speak to me
You just look at me and then you walk away from me
And if you started out to make a fool of me
Congratulations to you dear you're doing fine.
Well, you should be commanded for the sorrow you cause me
How does it feel to be the Queen of Misery
If you started out to break this heart inside of me
Congratulations to you dear you're doing fine.
Well you should be commanded for the sorrow you cause me
How does it feel to be the Queen of Misery
If you started out to break this heart inside of me
Congratulations to you dear you're doing fine
Corrine Corrina, where you been so long?
Corrine Corrina, where you been so long?
Ain't been no lovin' since you been gone

You called me country Willie
The night you walked away
With the one who promised you a life of joy
And you thought my life too simple
And yours was much too gay
To spend it living with a country boy
I'm writing you this letter
I write you every day
I hope that you've received the ones before
But I've heard not one word from you
And every day I pray
That you will not forget your country boy
You're living in the city
With riches at your door
Is this your love, is this your kind of joy?
Or do you find there's something missing?
Does your heart cry out for more?
And do you sometimes miss your country boy?

A cottage in the country
With roses round the door
Could not compete with flashing city lights
But it's all I have to offer
Except for one thing more
A heart so filled with love
That it could die
It's time to end this letter
The light of dawn is near
A lonely night has passed but there'll be more
And just one more thing in closing
For all the world to hear
"Come home, I love you, signed, your country boy"
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy crazy for feeling so blue
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry
Wondering what in the world did I do
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
And you're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

So please take these treasured dreams I have for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday these crazy arms will hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

And that's why I'm lonely all the time
If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream don't you sometimes think it's real
But it's only false emotions that you feel
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep gettin' bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky
So let your head down and go on and cry
If your heartaches...
[ guitar ]
Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin' Oooh
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder (fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger (stronger)
If I lived to be a hundred years old
Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Yeah now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now you say you've found someone that you love better (better)
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow ('morrow)
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door
Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Alright now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
(That it won't be long before it's cryin' time)
I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say hello
And though you wished me well
You couldn't tell
That I'd been
Crying over you
Crying over you
Then you said so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying
I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before
But darling, what can I do
Oh you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
I'm crying, crying
Oh-oh-oh-over you
Oh Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are ca-alling
From glen to glen
And down the mountain side
And the summer's gone
All the leaves are dy-why-ying
It's you, it's you 
Must go and I must bide
But come ye ba-ack 
When summer's in the mea-eadow
Or when the valley's hushed
And white with snow
I'll be here
In sunshine or in sha-adows
Oh Danny boy
Oh Da-a-a-anny boy
I love you so
But come ye ba-ack 
When summer's in the mea-eadow
Or when the winter's whi-ite
And hushed with snow
I'll be here
In sunshine or in sha-adows
Oh Danny boy
Oh Da-anny boy
I love you so...
Come and listen you fellows, young and so fine,
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines. 
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul, 
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal. 
And it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
And it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.
It's a-many a man I have known in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines. 
And it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
And it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.
O midnight, or the morning, or the middle of the day
It's the same to the miner who labors away
Where the demons of death often come by surprise
One fall of the slate and you're buried alive
And it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
And it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.
I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll, 
My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.
Where it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
And it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.
The morning that you left me was just another day
How could I see the sorrow that had found me
And then you laughed and told me that I was in your way
And I turned and ran as heaven fell around me
I stumbled through the darkness my footsteps were unsure
I lived within a world that had no sunshine
But when you left me darling my world came to an end
And there was darkness on the face of the earth
And the stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be found
The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around
Why did you ever leave me, you knew how it would hurt
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth
The stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be found
The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around
Why did you ever leave me, you knew how it would hurt
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth
When you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
Talking to those rich folks that you know
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
You know that I could never be alone

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flower by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Well when you're sitting back in your pink rose Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Days
I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
And another girl can take my pain away

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flower by US mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground

No I won't forget to put roses on your grave
This looks like a December day
This looks like a "time to remember" day
And I remember the spring, such a sweet tender thing
And love's summer college,
Where the green leaves of knowledge,
Were waiting to fall with the fall

And where September wine,
Numbed the measure of time
Through the tears of October, now November's over,
And this looks like a December day

This looks like a December day
It looks like we've come to the end of the way
And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning,
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
The ending that won't go away

And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning,

I'm drifting into deep water
I'm starting to care for you
And you're getting me in deep water
Be careful what you do
You want a romance
And I'm sick in love
I know I'll regret it when it ends
I'm drifting into deep water
Why can't we still be friends
It's so restless in this deep water
And I'm caught between right and wrong
My love's as true as deep water
Your love won't last that long
Where will it lead me and when will it end
I can't help but wish I only knew
And I'm drifting into deep water
So deep in love with you
I'm winding up in deep water
So deep in love with you
Delete and fast-forward, my friend
The wars are all over and nobody wins
But don't worry too much, just drive you crazy, my friend
So delete and fast-forward, my friend
Delete and fast-forward, my son
The elections are over and nobody won
You think it's all endin' but it's just settin' in
So delete and fast-forward, my friend
Delete and fast-forward again
It's just one big circle and it's beginning to end
What's next was now and what's now is now again
So delete and fast-forward again
Delete and fast-forward the news
The truth is the truth, but believe what you choose
When we blow the whole world back to where it began
Just delete and fast-forward again
Delete and fast-forward again
It's just one big circle and it's beginning to end
What's next was now, what's now is now again
And so delete and fast-forward again
Had a chance to be brilliant and we blew it again
So delete and fast-forward, my friend
Delete and fast-forward again
The bright lights of Denver
Were shining like diamonds
Like ten thousand jewels in the sky
And it's nobody's business
Where you're goin' or where you come from
And you've judged by the look in your eye

She saw him that evening in a tavern in town
In a quiet little out of the way place
And they smiled at each other
As he walked through the door
And they danced with their smiles on their faces
And they danced with their smiles on their face
I'd play the Red River Valley
And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, "Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?"

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his "Sidekick"
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
"Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' "

Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Headed down life's crooked road lot of things I never knowed
And because of me not knowin' I now pine
Trouble got in the trail spent the next five years in jail
Should have read that detour sign
Detour there's a muddy road ahead detour paid no mind to what it said
Detour oh the bitter things I find should have read that detour sign
I got stuck in the mud all my hopes dropped with a thud
And I thought that my heart strings were made of twine
But the father I go the more sorrow I know should have read that detour sign
Detour there's a muddy road ahead...
Should have read that detour sign should have read that detour sign
We were headed home to Austin
Caught pneumonia on the road
Taking it home to Connie and the kids
A wheel ran off and jumped a railroad
Then ran through a grocery store
If you want to buy a bus I'm taking bids

And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
He said traveling on the road is such a drag
If we can make it home by Friday we can brag
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag

Well I just got back from New York City
Kris and Rita done it all
Raw perfection there for all the world to see
Lord I heard an angel singing
In the Philharmonic Hall
Rita Coolidge, Rita Coolidge cleft for me

And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
He said traveling on the road is such a drag
If we can make it home by Friday we can brag
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
Did I ever ever love you?
Did I ever really care?
All the times that I cried for you 
Did I really want you there?
Wiser man then I have wondered 
About love and never knew
Did I ever love you?
I guess I still do
All the nights that I spent cryin' 
All those lonely loss of times
Was it my imagination?
Was it only in my mind?
Wiser man then I have wondered 
About love and never knew
Did I ever love you?
I guess I still do
I'm a kid with a guitar
Trying to play ?, when they ask
Where does your style come from?
I know what you mean
'Cause I learned to sing
Listening to blue, yodel number one
We love Hank and Lefty
Bob Wills, Ernest Tubb, and Johnny Cash
But if we had to pin point
The start of who we are
Or who we go by
The Django and Jimmie
Has Mississippi
A young singing brakeman
A jazz playing gypsy
Might not have been
A Merle or a Willie
If not for a Django and Jimmie
Through the twenties and thirties
Jimmie sang his way to the top
In spite of those old TB blues
Django was a star
He burned up a guitar
With just two good fingers to use
You can't turn back time
Or put more sand in the glass
But sometimes at night
I close my eyes and go back
The Django and Jimmie
Has Mississippi
A young singing brakeman
A jazz playing gypsy
Might not have been
A Merle or a Willie
If not for a Django and Jimmie
It might not have been
A Merle or a Willie
If not for a Django and Jimmie
Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unsure
Makes will power weak and temptation strong
 
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man
They say that it's a man's world
Well you can improve that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man
I'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go
And the first to say be happy if you can
But you lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you so
Do you mind too much if I don't understand
I suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do
Life is short and sweet break all the hearts you can
I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to you
But do you mind too much if I don't understand
Forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
And my heart and me we'd made so many plans
But that's all over now there's nothing left to do
But do you mind too much if I don't understand
Do you mind too much if I don't understand
Down at the corner beer joint, dancin' on the Rock 'n' Roll
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul
Down at the corner beer joint, dancin' on a hardwood floor
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before
Than they did before, than they did before
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before
Down at corner beer joint dancing to the Rock 'n' Roll
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul
Likes to move her soul, move her soul
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul
Sister comin' home, Momma gonna let her sleep the whole day long
Sister comin' home, Momma gonna let her sleep the whole day long
Sweet dream baby,
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby,
How long must I dream.
Dream baby, got me dreamin'
Aweet dreams the whole day through.
Dream baby got me dreamin'
Sweet dreams in nighttime too.

That won't do
Dream baby, help me stop my dreamin' of you
And make my dreams come true.
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby,
How long must I dream
I just thought that you would like to know
That I would do anything
Just to make your dreams
Just to make your dreams come true
Well, I just thought that you would like to know
That I, I would climb the highest tree
Just to make your dreams
Just to make your dreams come true
I know that it seems like
I am full of hot air
But my heart is in the right place
I swear, I swear
I just thought that you would like to know
That I, I would do anything
Just to make your dreams
Just to make your dreams come true
Now, I know that it seems like
I'm full of hot air
But my heart, my heart is in the right place
I swear, I swear
And I just thought that you would like to know
That I, I'd do anything, anything
Just to make your dreams
Just to make your dreams come true
Just to make your dreams
Just to make your dreams come true
I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam
He said is my country just a little off track
Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back
But, it's better than not comin' back at all
Many a good men I saw fall
And even now, every time I dream
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream
Drive on, don't mean nothin'
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on
I remember on night, Tex and me
Rappelled in on a hot L.Z.
But we had our 16's on rock and roll
But with all that fire, was scared and cold
We were crazy, we were wild
And I have seen the tiger smile
I spit in a bamboo viper's face
And I'd be dead, but by God's grace
Drive on, don't mean nothin'
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on
It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain
And nobody tried to be John Wayne
I came home, Tex did not
And I can't talk about the hit he got
I got a little limp now when I walk
Got a little tremolo when I talk
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam
Drive on, don't mean nothin'
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on
I know my part
I'll bring up the rear
I'll eat the dust
You know, I don't care
That's what I do
I'll get 'em through
I'm driving the herd

I sing them to sleep
I sing them awake
They like my songs
They give and I take
I know my part
I play from the heart

While I'm driving the herd
Maybe I'm following
They'll let me know
If I'm doing it right
They'll sing-a-long with me every night
That's how I know
That they're liking the show
Well, I'm driving the herd
Or maybe they're driving me?

Maybe I'm following
They'll let me know
If I'm doing it right
They'll sing-a-long with me every night
That's how I know
That they're liking the show
Well, I'm driving the herd
Or maybe they're driving me?

While I'm driving the herd
Maybe they're driving me
I threw my robe on in the morning
Watched the ring on the stove turn red
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee
Pulled on my boots and made the bed
Screen door hangin' off its hinges
Kept bangin' me awake all night
As I look out the window
The only thing in sight
Is dry lightning on the horizon line
Just dry lightning and you on my mind.
I chased the heat of her blood
Like it was the holy grail
Descend beautiful spirit
Into the evening pale
Her appaloosa's
Kickin' in the corral smelling rain
There's a low thunder rolling
'Cross the mesquite plain
But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line
It's just dry lightning and you on my mind
I'd drive down to Alvarado Street
Where she'd dance to make ends meet
I'd spend the night over my gin
As she'd talk to her men
Well the piss yellow sun
Comes bringin' up the day
She said "Ain't nobody can give nobody
What they really need anyway."
Well you get so sick of the fightin'
You lose your fear of the end
But I can't lose your memory
And the sweet smell of your skin
And it's just dry lightning on the horizon line
Just dry lightning and you on my mind
A thousand miles, dear 
A thousand more across the water 
Across the shore
I'll say a prayer, dear 
For yours and mine 
Please think of me, dear 
Each night at nine
I hold your picture 
Close to my heart 
It takes your place, dear 
While we're apart
Helps remind me 
That you're still mine 
To feel your nearness 
Each night at nine
The bugle's playing 
Out go the lights 
Even it's lonely these army nights
Go tell kids I'm doing fine 
Give them my love, dear 
Each night at nine
A thousand miles, dear 
A thousand more across the water 
Across the shore
I'll say a prayer, dear 
For yours and mine 
Please think of me, dear 
Each night at nine
I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain, aoh
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can, aoh
See I begged, stole and I borrowed, yeah
Ooh, that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin', yeah, oh
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it, oh, no
Ooh, that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin', yeah, oh
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
Yeah, I wanna be free, just me, oh, babe
Yeah, oh, yeah
That's why I'm easy, baby
Easy like Sunday mornin', yeah, oh
That's why I'm easy, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday mornin', oh
Why I'm easy, yeah
Easy like Sunday mornin'
That's why I'm easy, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
Said, I'm easy like Sunday
I'm easy like Sunday, I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
I'm easy like Sunday mornin', mornin, yeah
I'm so easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin', yeah, yeah
I feel so easy, yeah, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
Easy like Sunday mornin'
I'm easy like Sunday morn, mornin'
I've traveled o'er the country wide a seekin' fortune fair
I've been down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
From Portland East and Portland West and back along the line
I'm goin' now to a place that's best that old home town of mine
Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I 'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart
There's sure to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand
Oh eight more miles and Louisville...
Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love site is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville
Eight more miles to Louisville...
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me
I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want these arms about you
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you
I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you
So don't you be, a naughty baby
Come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you
Each time you hurt me, you say you're sorry.
I try to understand, and say: "OK."
But there must be an end to understanding,
And the end of mine can't be too far away.
I try to understand that you're "only human".
And "we all make mistakes" every day.
But there must be an end to understanding,
And I know that I just can't go on this way.
Don't you know that love and understanding go together:
Ask too much of one and both will die.
And there must be an end to understanding,
And I know, someday, I'll reach the end of mine.
Don't you know that love and understanding go together:
Ask too much of one and both will die.
And there must be an end to understanding,
And I know, someday, I'll reach the end of mine.
Everybody's talkin' 'bout me
But I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes in my mind
Everybody stops to starin'
But I don't even see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through a pourin' rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off the northeast wind
And sailin' on summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' 'bout me
But I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind
Everybody stops to starin'
But I don't even see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
But I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave my love behind
I've got a new car, an' it drives just like a dream.
I've got money, an' can buy most anything.
I've got places to go an' things to do.
I've got everything, everything but you. 
I've got a date book that's just bulging at the seams.
I've got the numbers of all the local queens.
They give me memories that last a day or two.
I've got everything, everything but you. 
But this new car I drive don't mean anything,
Which reminds me: there's a payment overdue.
An' they say that I'm a man who's got everything.
Yeah, I've got everything, everything but you.  
An' this new car that I drive don't mean anything,
Which reminds me: there's a payment overdue.
An' they say that I'm a man who's got everything.
Yeah, I've got everything, everything but you.
I'll take you with me everywhere I go
I'll put you in my pocket, who will know?
Right next to my heart at every show
I'll take you with me everywhere I go
No matter where our trails will finally wind
Our paths will just keep crossing, yours and mine
Until then, and in my pocket you must go
I'll take you with me everywhere I go
No matter where our trails will finally wind
Our paths will just keep crossing, yours and mine
Until then, and in my pocket you must go
I'll take you with me everywhere I go
Until then, and in my pocket you must go
I'll take you with me everywhere I go
I know why I waited
Know why I've been blue
I've been waiting each day
For someone exactly like you
Why should I spend some money
On a show or two
When nobody sings these love songs
Exactly like you
You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
You make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming
Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you
You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
Baby you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming
Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Yes she knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you
These lines in my face, caused from worry,
Grow deeper as you walk out of sight.
Mine is the face of a fighter,
But my heart has just lost the fight. 
Round one: you told me you loved me,
An' I felt my heart falling there an' then.
The last round: you walked tall an' left me,
An' I guess my heart's losing again. 
Mine is the face of a fighter:
I fought for your love with all my might.
Mine is the face of fighter,
But my heart has just lost the fight. 
Yes, mine is the face of a fighter:
I fought for your love with all my might.
Mine is the face of fighter,
But my heart has just lost the fight.
When I look at the letter that you wrote to me
It's you that I'm thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
[Chorus]
I miss you darlin' more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past and all the pleasure we had,
As I watch the mating of a dove,
And it was in the springtime that we said goodbye.
I remember our faded love.
[Chorus]
There's a family Bible on the table
Its pages worn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories

At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one

I can see us sittin' round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me

Now this old world of ours is filled with trouble
This old world would also better be
If we'd found more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing, rock of ages cleft for me

I can see us sittin' round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me
Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me
If the sun's too hot cool it if you can
Better go out and get yourself a five cent fan
And fan it, fan it, you gotta fan it and cool it
Honey till the cows come home
Just met myself a new girl and her name was Sue
She said, "To make love to you, honey tell you what to do"
You gotta fan it, fan it, you gotta fan it and cool it
Honey till the cows come home
My mamma's in the kitchen, I just heard that back door slam
Come out of that kitchen honey, quit scorching that ham
And let's just fan it, fan it, you gotta fan it and cool it
Honey till the cows come home
Well, I got six months in jail, my back turned to the wall
Fannin' that thing was the cause of it all
So fan it, fan it, gotta fan it and cool it
Honey till the cows come home
Far away places with strange sounding names
Far away over the sea
Those far away places with the strange sounding names are
Calling
Calling me
Goin' to China or maybe Siam
I wanna see for myself 
Those far away places I've been reading about in a 
Book that I took from a shelf
I start getting' restless whenever I hear the whistle of a train
I pray for the day I can get underway
And look for those castles in Spain
They call me a dreamer
Well maybe I am
But I know that I'm burning to see those 
Far away places with the strange sounding names
Calling, calling me
Me
Tempted and tried
We're oft made to wonder
Why it should take us
All the day long
While there are others
Living about us
Never molested
Though in the wrong.
Farther along
We'll know all about
Farther along
We'll understand why
Cheer up my brother
Live in the sunshine
We'll understand it
All by and by.
When we see Jesus
Coming in glory
When he comes down from
His home in the sky
Then we shall meet him
In that bright mansion
We'll understand it
All by and by.
Farther along
We'll know all about
Farther along
We'll understand why
Cheer up my brother
Live in the sunshine
We'll understand it
All by and by.
We'll understand it
All by and by
Where you been Johnny?
What you been doin'?
I'm just fiddlin' round
I played this guitar till my folks were sick of it
They won't never get well as long as you're pickin' it
I played this old harp 'til my mouth looka funny
It aint no fiddle but it sure makes more money
You'll live to a hundred though, fiddlin' 'round
Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
There's no such thing as perfect strangers
So I come to you the way I am
If you call on me to sacrifice
I won't promise that I can
We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire
We will wake up when the moment's gone
And I'll still feel you on my fingertips
But they'll be nothing in the after burn
But the taste upon our lips
We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire
I'm not here tonight to rescue you
And you don't need me in your life
But I know I'll have the best of you tonight
We're fire to fire
Flame to flame
Pure desire
No retrains or sad songs
Only fire to fire
Only fire to fire
Beside a singing mountain stream 
Where the willow grew
Where the silver leaf of maple
Sparkled in the morning dew
I braided twigs of willows
Made a string of buckeye beads
But flesh and blood needs flesh And blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need
I leaned against a bark of birch
And I breathed the honey dew
I saw a North-bound flock of geese
Against a sky of baby blue
Beside the lily pads
I carved a whistle from a reed
Mother Nature's quite a lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need.
A cardinal sang just for me
And I thanked him for the song
Then the sun went slowly down the west
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my mind and spirit feed
But flesh and blood need flesh and blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need.
So when this day was ended
I was still not satisfied
For I knew everything I touched
Would wither and would die
And love is all that will remain
And grow from all these seeds
Mother Nature's quite a lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need.
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
And let me know what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, darling kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
She always follows me from town to town 
At least her memories follow me around
Whenever I clear my mind so she can see 
I feel her love come rushing into me
I know that I will never be the law 
Looks as though her memory's bound to haunt
And I know my love will always stay in bounds
With her memory always follow me around
Follow me around 
Follow me around 
Follow me around 
Follow me around
And I know my love will always stay in bounds
With her memory always following me around
Follow me around follow me around
With her memory always following me around
I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns,"
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin'
In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
But I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move out over a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away
You took me up to heaven - when you took me in your arms
I was dazzled by your kisses - blinded by your charms
I was lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise
When you told me that you loved me - I gave my heart to you
And I wondered if there could be any truth in love so new
I was lost - in a fool's paradise
Good and lost - in a fool's paradise
The whole world was my kingdom
And you the gem in my crown
Then I saw you glance at a new romance
And my love came tumbling down
Though you treat me kind of coolish - and may never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish because I love you so
I'll still got lost in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise
There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me
I've got to beware
[Chorus]
Think it's time we
Stop! Hey
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down 
There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right, if everybody's wrong
People speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance
From behind
[Chorus]
Singing songs and carrying signs
Getting so much resistance
From behind
[Chorus]
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line
The Men come and shoot you down
[Chorus]
Hey! What's that sound
Look what's going down.
Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times
I'll get along you'll find another
I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow...
Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
I just keep thinking and your memory is forever on my mind
You know I'll always love you and I can't forget the days when you were mine
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy
Oh what a heartache but I forgive the things you said to me
Cause I believe forgiving is the only way that I'll find peace of mind
And forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
The years have passed so quickly as once again fate steals a young man's dreams
Of all the golden years and growing old together you and me
You asked me to forgive you you said there was another on your mind
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
Out where the bright lights are glowing 
You're drawn like a moth to a flame
You laugh while the wine's overflowing 
While I sit and whisper your name
Four walls to hear me 
Four walls to see 
Four walls too near me 
Closing in on me
Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting 
But my walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love not for hating 
So here where you left I stay
Four walls to hear me 
Four walls to see 
Four walls too near me 
Closing in on me
One night with you is like heaven 
And so while I'm walking the floor
I listen for steps in the hallway 
And wait for your knock on my door
Four walls to hear me 
Four walls to see 
Four walls too near me 
Closing in on me
Far across the blue waters
Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
Casey Jones he was a mighty man
But now he's resting in the promised land
The kind of music you can understand
Was an eight wheel driver under his command
He made the freight train boogie
All the time
He made the freight train boogie
As he rolled down the line
When the fireman started to ring the bell
Everybody hung around to tell
Casey Jones was a coming to town, 
On a six-eight wheeler that was flat on the ground
He made the freight train boogie
All the time
He made the freight train boogie
As he rolled down the line
Casey Jones he was a mighty man
But now he's resting in the promised land
The kind of music you can understand
Was an eight wheel driver under his command
He made the freight train boogie
All the time
He made the freight train boogie
As he rolled down the line
When the fireman started to ring the bell
Everybody hung around to tell
Casey Jones was a coming to town, 
On a six-eight wheeler that was flat on the ground
He made the freight train boogie
All the time
He made the freight train boogie
As he rolled down the line
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow
Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away"
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler Stop!
For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day
Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow
Hello there my it's been a long time
How am I doin'? Well, I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday
It ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
What if I remember that's the same thing that you told me it was lonely yes
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
I gotta go now 
I guess I'll see you somewhere around
You don't know, you'll never know, we don't know, you can't know when 
I'll be back in town
Maybe tomorrow, please remember
What I told you, told you, that entire time you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time slips away
Oh, what I want you to do is just remember, just remember, what I told you
And time, time, you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
One day I want you to do
Just remember, remember, what I told you
And time, time
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slipped away
It's the same thing, same thing, that you told me 
It seems like just the other day
It ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
It's a funny thing about the time
It's funny baby, how time slips away
Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
An' just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia, a song of you,
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me;
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see,
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

On my mind
On my mind

On my mind
On my mind

On my mind
On my mind

On my mind
On my mind
Why do I still write why do I still call
Why do I still think there's hope for us at all
These are the tings I hate but they're the things I do to get over you
Sunsets make me cry old pictures make me grin
But I don't really care to see your face again
These are the things I say but they're so hard to do like gettin' over you
You gotta believe that there's a reason that we surrender up our hearts
But there's a vantage point and it takes some time to find
Where you can see how all the pieces fit as you watch 'em fall apart
Now I don't think it's right and you don't know what's wrong
My heart keeps asking me just where do we belong
It's not as though my life ain't hard enough to do try gettin' over you
You gotta believe that there's a reason...
Now other people say stop living in the past
But when there's nothin' left it's your memory that lasts
It's later than you think but still this isn't through this gettin' over you
Now it's later than you think and still this isn't through this gettin' over you
The silence is unusually loud tonight 
The strange sound of nothing fills my ears
The night rushes in like a crowd of nights 
And the ghost of our old love goes away
This strange world of darkness 
That comes with the night
Grows darker when it walks my way
And it lasts while I listen 
For the breaking of day
And the ghost of our old love goes away
This strange world of darkness
And the ghost of our old love goes away
An old cowboy went ridin out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cries

Yippie I ohhh ohh ohh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught em yet
'Cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Yippie I ohhh oh oh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Go away; can't you see I'm cryin'?
Go back to the new love that you've found.
Don't sweet talk me, 'cause I ain't listenin',
And you'll only make things worse by hangin' round. 
I know that I'd be crazy,
If I took you back again.
But this foolish heart of mine,
Might just weaken and give in.
So go away,
I feel much better when you're gone.
For you're the one who made me cry.
Now let me cry alone. 
I know that I'd be crazy,
If I took you back again.
But this foolish heart of mine,
Might just weaken and give in.
So go away,
I feel much better when you're gone.
For you're the one who made me cry.
Now let me cry alone.
Your watching your watch and I know what's on your mind
There's someone home waiting and you're away over time
What should be so right is as wrong as can be
Go on home you don't belong here with me
I love you I love you I love only you
But the one home who's waiting he loves you too
He's worried and he's wondering where can you be
Go on home you don't belong here with me
Go on home you don't belong here with me
Though I want you and I need you desperately
But to hide here in the darkness is as wrong as can be
Go on home you don't belong here with me
Go on home you don't belong here with me
God rest you merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
From God our heavenly father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The son of god by name
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
"Fear not", then said the angel
"Let nothing you afright
This day is born a Savior
Of virtue, power, and might
So frequently to vanquish all
The friends of Satan quite"
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm, and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
This blessed babe to find
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
But when to Bethlehem they came
Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
I did the best I could do
Or the best I could tell
The higher I flew, the farther I fell 
Born in the mud,
Raised in the wild
Washed in the blood,
God's Problem Child
I feel the shine, following me
Not far behind, that's where I wanna be
A little out of town, fine by me
Darkness may fall
We still got a light
Keeping us all
Safe through the night
Heaven must love
God's problem child
Heaven must love
God's problem child
Heaven must love
God's problem child
I'm throwin' a goin' away party
A party for a dream of mine
So put me somewhere off in a corner
With a glass and bottle of your party wine
Don't worry it won't be a loud party
I feel too low to get too high
It's just a sad goin' away party
For a dream I'm telling goodbye
I'm throwin' a goin' away party
A party for a dream of mine
Nobody's coming but a heartache
And some tears will drop in now most anytime
Don't worry it won't be a loud party
Dreams don't make noise when they die
And so since it's a goin' away party
Go away and let me cry
Hey, it's just a sad goin' away party
For a dream I'm tellin' goodbye, goodbye
I'm throwin' a goin' away party

Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon and dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray

Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud

Well, did he make you cry? Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale

Well, did he make you cry, make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?

Did he make you cry, make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home?
A long time forgotten are dreams
that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times
or the bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times
they've had and all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man

He likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Though she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man

Just two good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm
Beats all you never saw, been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born
Straightenin' the curves, flattenin' the hills
Someday the mountain might get 'em but the law never will
Makin' their way, the any way they know how
That's just a little bit more than the law will allow
Makin' their way, the any way they know how
That's just a little bit more than the law will allow
Just two good ol' boys, wouldn't change if they could
Fightin' the system like a true modern day Robin Hood
Everybody's gone away said they're moving to LA
There's not a soul I know around everybody's leavin' town
Some caught a freight some caught a plane find the sunshine leave the rain
They said this town'll waste your time I guess they're right it's wastin' mine
Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
You know my heart keeps telling me you're not a kid at thirty-three
You play around you lose your wife you play too long you lose your life
I got my pills to ease the pain can't find a thing to ease the rain
I'd love to try and settle down but everybody's leavin' town
Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
A long time forgotten are dreams
that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times
or the bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times 
they've had and all the good times to come
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man

Well, you may be an ambassador to England or France
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls
[Chorus]
But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
It may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you're gonna have to serve somebody
Might be a rock'n' roll addict prancing on the stage
Might have money and drugs at your commands, women in a cage
You may be a business man or some high degree thief
They may call you Doctor or they may call you Chief
[Chorus]
You may be a state trooper, you might be an young turk
You may be the head of some big TV network
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame
You may be living in another country under another name
[Chorus]
You may be a construction worker working on a home
You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome
You might own guns and you might even own tanks
You might be somebody's landlord you might even own banks
[Chorus]
You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side
You may be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir
[Chorus]
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk
You might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread
You may be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-sized bed
[Chorus]
You may call me Terry, you may call me Jimmy
You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray
You may call me anything but no matter what you say
[Chorus]
The Mississippi Delta was shining like a National guitar
I am following the river down the highway through the cradle of the Civil War
I'm going to Graceland, Graceland, in Memphis Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland
Poorboys and pilgrims with families and we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old, the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe we both will be received in Graceland

She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that, as if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed she way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart, everybody feels the wind blow
I'm going to Graceland, in Memphis Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland
Poorboys and pilgrims with families and we are going to Graceland
My traveling companions are ghosts and empty sockets ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe we both will be received, in Graceland

There is a girl in Austin, Texas and she calls herself the human trampoline
Sometimes when I'm falling, flying, tumbling in turmoil I say this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I say losing love is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart, everybody feels the wind blow
And I'm going to Graceland, in Memphis Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain, some part of me wants to see Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend every love and every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe we all will be received in Graceland

Oh, oh, Graceland, Graceland, I'm going to Graceland
Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say, "Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
"Might be snakes there in that grass"
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her,
"Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus hands"
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say, "Matty don' you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple core"
But I don't have Grandma anymore
If I get to Heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands
Cyrus Jones 1810 to 1913
Made his great grandchildren believe
he could live to a 103
A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid
So, Cyrus Jones lived forever
[Chorus]
Gravedigger
When you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain
Gravedigger
Muriel Stonewall 1903 to 1954
She lost both of her babies in the second great war
Now, you should never have to watch your only children lowered in the ground
that means you should never have to bury your own babies
[Chorus]
Ring around the rosey
Pocket full o'posey
Ashes to ashes
{Musical intro}
We all fall down
[Chorus]
Little Mikey Carson '67 to '75
He rode his bike like the devil until the day he died
When he grows up he wants to be Mr. Vertigo on the flying trapeze
Oh, 1940 to 1992
[Chorus]
When you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain
I can feel the rain
I can feel the rain
[Chorus]
Grave digger
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me someday to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share
And I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
Is he tall, is he handsome
Does he make enough and then some
Does he miss you every minute that he's gone
Is he funny, is he witty
Does he tell you that you're pretty
Did he hang the moon, did he do no wrong
Is he Mr. Right, I wonder what he's like
The one you're waiting on

'Cause there's an empty seat beside you
And every guy here's trying to buy you
Something to drink
But you just keep brushing them off
You're watching whatever's on cable
Swirling your glass on the table
Wondering how long is too long
Is he working late, is he worth the wait
The one you're waiting on

How many glasses of Cabernet
How many minutes slip away
How many times were you gonna check your phone
I'm telling you if you were mine
You wouldn't be sitting here counting the time
You'd never spend a single moment alone
I bet he don't get how lucky he is
The one you're waiting on

How many glasses of Cabernet
How many boys can you turn away
How long 'til you turn off your phone
And look up at me, I'd be happy to be
The one you're waiting on
I'd be happy to be
The one you're waiting on
I can hear her heart beat
It seams a little strong
I can hear the things I did wrong
I can hear her thoughts
By looking in her eyes
I can hear her all the times she cried
I can hear the memories
As they echo off the wall
Falling from the pictures down the hall
I can hear regret
Building up in side of me
And I can hear all the things
I could not see
Those are the sounds of a woman leaving
Stronger then the wind in a willow tree
Those are the sounds of a heart breaking
You can't hear it
But the noise is killing me
I should of heard it coming
But I chose to pretend
I should of recognizes that sound
Way back then
But I just wouldn't listen didn't want to all those years
Now the truth is ringing clear 
In my ears
Those are the sounds of a woman leaving
Stronger then the wind in willow tree
Those are the sounds of a heart breaking
You can't hear it
But the noise is killing me
Those are the sounds of a heart breaking
You can't hear it 
But the noise is killing me
I can hear it 
And the silence is killing me
The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, "This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all"
"Your torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck"
He said, "I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks"
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
Then he said, "Ain't you that songwriter guy"
And I said, "Yes I am," he said, "So am I"
He sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
He said, "What do you think
Now don't hold nothin' back"
Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look 
And I said, "This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs are backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak"
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
And I said, "Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news
But your whole melodic structure's done worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you"
"And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for..eigh..nine hundred bucks"
But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long
You guessed it
Well, It may be a hit
I like it
We'll I'm ready to raise the blinds in this place
Think I'll rejoin the human race
You said yes now your wearing my ring
Guess I can stop playing ol B.B. King
[Chorus]
Cause the thrill is back
The heartache's gone
Time stands still baby love lives on
The room spins around when your kissing me
The thrill is back like it used to be
I sure could use a hair cut and shave
Now that I'm crawling outta my cave
Since you've said we were through
I've been down with a case of the blues
[Chorus]
I think I'd better give my doctor a call
And tell him I won't need that prozac after all
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Tag
The room spins around when your kissing me
The thrill is back like it used to be
Wish I were down, on some blue bayou
With a bamboo cane, stuck in the sand
But the road I'm on, don't seem to go there
So I just dream, and keep on bein' the way I am
Wish I enjoyed, what makes my livin'
What I do, with a willin' hand
Some would run, but that ain't like me
So I just dream, and keep on bein' the way I am
The way I am, don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see, that bobber dancin'
But I just dream, and keep on bein' the way I am
The way I am, don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see, that bobber dancin'
But I just dream, and keep on bein' the way I am
Yeah, I just dream and keep on bein' the way I am
There you were standin' in the shadows
Well I just looked where I don't see
I'm still pretendin' I don't need you
I won't let you know you're killin' me
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
I'm actin' like it doesn't matter
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name
There goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words
I meant to say
There go the games 
I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you
Well I think you're playin' with me darlin'
You like to see what you can do
Well I should be fishin' for Blue Marlin
Instead of being hooked again by you
There goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words
I meant to say
There go the games 
I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you
Yeah there goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my heart fallin' for you
There goes my heart fallin' for you
We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star 
Shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head 
But he pointed his hand
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for 
The new Kings pleasures
Well I've heard 
That a King might come
But up 'til now there hasn't been one
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
There's an old hardwood tree starin' through the glass at me
It's been there since eighty-five, sometimes I think it reads my mind
I guess it's true, you cant keep it from shinnin' through
[Chorus]
There's no denyin', I've been hidin' from this thing that's chasin' me
Yeah, I've been runnin', no good at shunnin' all these scars from yesterday
There comes a time you gotta give it up, spin that wheel and try your luck
Never know what you will find, it might be love this time
I knew it from that very first smile, I could taste it like a hungry child
Not at all like all the rest, you know they say that last is best
Like a rainbow on a cloudy day, just to shout it takes my breath away
[Chorus]
I've been hidin' from this thing that's chasin' me
I've been runnin', no good at shunnin' all these scars from yesterday
There comes a time you gotta give it up, spin that wheel and try your luck
Never know what you will find, it might be love this time
This time, this time, oh, this time, this time
This time.
Three minute positive not too country
Up-tempo love song
This is a three minute song
To tell her that I love her
And how wonderful we get along
A sweet sentiment that's borderline stick
A lot of right and not much wrong
It's a little bit edgy, but softer than spaghetti
Weak yet redundantly strong
It's a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
It's a way for me to tell her that I love her
But it can't be too long
There will be no drinkin' no cheatin'
No lyin' no leavin'that stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
You won't hear four-letter words
Just me tellin' her
That she's the every breath I draw
And how I can't live without her
And I could never doubt her
'Cause she could never do no wrong
Well it's the right amount of timin' the proper form of rhymin' a little guitar
Then it's gone
It's a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
[Chorus]
Yeah in a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
There will be no drinkin' no cheatin'
No lyin' no leavin' that stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
Yeah in a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
If I never see your loving face again
I'll go on loving you 'till the end
And if my broken-hearted love don't find a way to mend
I'll go on loving you 'till the end
The years and miles may separate you from me
The pain may lessen more as time goes by
But as for me your memories will never fade
And I'll go on loving you 'till the end
If we're ever free to love again I know
Straight back to your waiting arms is where I'll go
And I'll stay forever and I'll prove to you again
I'll go on loving you 'till the end
And I'll go on loving you
'Till the end
I've been a waiter, a roofer, a clerk
I've shoveled manure till my pride hurt.
When you're starting out, it's all part of the work
To do what I do.
I've been evicted for not making rent
Made my Daddy wonder where my good sense went.
For the price of a dream, my years have been spent
To do what I do.
So I stand here tonight with this six string guitar
To be something I've always been in my heart.
Just for the chance to play you my song
The thrill when I hear you singing along.
It's been worth everything I've been through
To do what I do.
I've played for empty tables and chairs
The drunks that don't listen, the crowds that don't care.
Been told countless times Boy you ain't goin' nowhere
To do what I do.
So I hope the critics and skeptics alike
All bought a ticket to this show tonight.
And they'll see firsthand that I have survived
And what doesn't kill you makes you more alive.
And I'm one of the fortunate few
To do what I do.
There's so much joy this music can bring
So I count my blessings when I step up to sing.
Cause they're so many people who would give anything
To do what I do.
And I thank you.
I can do what I do!
Our room was filled with silence
I guess we'd said it all
I don't know when I'd seen our bedroom
So long I can't recall
We'd built this thing between us
I'm not sure what's the cause
So I swallowed all my pride
And tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
Makin' love is so much sweeter
When you love the one you hold
After all these years of holdin' her
You'd think by now I'd know
Now as we lie here together
All our troubles seem so small
Just these satin sheets between us
Cause tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand 
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
Smiles in the morning as warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night 
And two loving arms to console me 
I should be scared it's so right 
But too much of a good thing is a good thing 
Feelings like this can't be wrong 
And too much of a good thing is a good thing 
And we've got a good thing going on 
You look in my eyes and see my thinking 
I know when you're happy, and when you're sad 
Some would say it's too perfect 
But I don't think what we have is so bad 
Cause too much of a good thing is a good thing 
Feelings like this can't be wrong 
And too much of a good thing is a good thing 
And we've got a good thing going on 
Yeah, we've got a good thing going on
I thought some time in the sun
Would help me get over you
But I could tell from day one
This is a place meant for two
Now here I sit on the beach
Watching the tide ebb and flow
I booked my room for a week
But now I'm ready to go
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
Blow me away
This should be paradise
Heaven down by the sea
Without you here by my side
It feels like hell to me
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
Blow me away
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
Blow me away
True love is a golden ring
Like the vows we made it's a precious thing
Sent from above on silver wings
And true love is a golden ring
Down a winding road with many turns
Through fire and smoke and bridges burned
I've held my share of stranger's hands
Now holding yours, well, I understand
True love is a golden ring
Like the vows we made it's a precious thing
Sent from above on silver wings
True love is a golden ring
Love is so much more than a one night stand
Like the endless turn of a wedding band
Looking in your eyes I found the truth 
After all this time I found you
True love is a golden ring
Like the vows we made it's a precious thing
Sent from above on silver wings
True love is a golden ring
True love is a golden ring
True love is a golden ring
True love is a golden ring
True love is a golden ring
True love
O soul are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior
And life more abundant and free
Turn you eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conquerors we are
And turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
His word shall not fail you, He promised
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell
And turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
I heard you've been wondering
How I'm getting along
I guess you think I can't make it with you gone
But I don't want you to worry
Don't you lose any sleep
But a man called long-distance this morning
Said they're thinking about putting me
On the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today
I don't sleep in the nighttime
Darkness reminds me of you
I lost eight pounds since last Tuesday
But I could stand to lose a few
I don't believe I'm too bad
People say I look fine
The man from the paper seems happy
Says I'm bigger than the latest crime
On the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today
So if you're concerned in trouble
Then you're hurting me
Don't you work out this little thing called losing you
Has made a big man out of me
I'm on the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today
You told me you don't love me, when you walked out the door
I stood there feelin' lonely, then the tears began to pour
What else could I do, I'd never felt like that before
So I cried an ol' blue river in the middle of the floor
[Chorus]
Now I'm up to my ears in tears
I'm cryin' night and day since you went away
The things you used to say, honey, I no longer hear
That water's cold and clear, I'm drownin' for you dear
Up to my ears in tears
Well I found some old love letters you wrote me years ago
But the words all ran together when the tears began to flow
Cause you left that water runnin' now it's got nowhere to go
If I can't wash away your memory well I'll just go under slow
[Chorus]
The water's cold and clear
I'm drowning for you dear
Up to my ears in tears
Wait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
Far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love
Doin' the road
Get the music done
And move along
What good does it do
To play your songs for her
And hear her say
Wait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
Far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love
You're rollin' along
Life's been good to you
An even so
She comes to you
Late at night
The time you hear her say
Once again...
Wait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
Far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love
There's a lady living right above me
Pretty as a picture on the wall
Once I helped her with a bag of groceries
We met a time or two out in the hall
She told me somebody hurt her feelings
The hurt that's in her eyes is plain to see
Slowly she's been wearing out my ceiling
Walkin' the floor over me
Every night I hear her cryin'
Cryin' over some old memory
A little of my heart is down here dyin'
'Cause she's walkin' the floor over me
Back and forth I followed every footstep
Countin' long enough to fall asleep
Had the sweetest dream last night 'cause I dreamt
She was walkin' the floor over me
Every night I hear her cryin'
Cryin' over some old memory
A little of my heart is down here dyin'
'Cause she's walkin' the floor over me
That woman is walkin' the floor over me
Excuse me, ma'am can you help me
I need to place an ad with you today
No ma'am tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away
What's that, no this is personal
I'm not buying or selling anything
Yes ma'am, I know just what to say
I wrote it down, this is how it should read
Wanted one good hearted woman
To forgive imperfection in the man that she loved
Wanted just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
What's that, no that's all I want to say
I just hope these few lines will get to her
Yes ma'am, she means everything
I hope she comes back when she reads these words
Here comes a Baptist, here comes a Jew
There goes a Mormon and a Muslim too
I see a Buddhist and a Hindu
I see a Catholic and I see you
We're all God's children
We're all God's children
We're all God's children
Why can't we be one big happy family?
You like the day and I like the night
He's into country and he's isn't quit
There's folks on the left and the far right
But that doesn't mean that we have to fight
We're all God's children
All God's children
Yeah, we're all God's children
Why can't we be one big happy family?
White folks, yellow folks, black and tan
On the same planet in the same plan
A feminist woman and a he man
We're all playin' the magic hand
We're all God's children
We're all God's children
Oh, we're all God's children
Why can't we be one big happy family?
We're all God's children
All God's children
Yeah, we're all God's children
Why can't we be one big happy family?
We're all God's children
All God's children
We're all God's children
Why can't we be one big happy family?
We're all God's children
We're all God's children
Yeah, we're all God's children
Why can't we be one big happy family?
We're all God's children
We're all God's children
We're all God's children
We're all, black and white
We're all precious in his sight
We're all God's children
We're all God's children
We're all God's children
Why can't we all be one big happy family?
Looking through these old photographs
Don't they bring some good memories back
Some of them make us laugh, some make us cry
I'm glad we kept all these souvenirs
To prove that our love was here
Look how happy we were, pictures don't lie
If forever should end today
And there's no tomorrow for us
What a day yesterday was
Here's one of us with you calm and cool
But look at me acting a fool
And here's one of us on the Ferris wheel at the fair
Hey ain't we had a barrel of fun
And the best may be yet to come
We may have a hundred years still left to share
But
If forever should end today
And there's no tomorrow for us
What a day yesterday was
Let's close this book of photographs
And let's turn out the lights
And love for the moment
As if it were the last
When God paints, birds sing
He colors every feather on a sparrow's wings
When God paints, the wind blows
With a stroke of love, he dips his brush in a rainbow

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints, the heart beats
Life begins, a season ends and lovers meet
And I've learned that sometimes
It's not always black and white or well-defined
When God paints

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints, we dance
And I reach across the canvas and I take your hand
And my world is so complete
When I look at you, a masterpiece is all I see
When God paints

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his big as critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints
I pray I always see the beauty inside the frame
When God paints
Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
Through the years and the tears
I've learned what love's about
And this time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
Too many times I've lost a good love
And I can see now I let it down
But if love comes back to me
It won't see the same old me
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
Yeah, I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When your heart is all alone every second 
Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those ol' clouds that rain so blue
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you
When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you
So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello 
We both agree we're just no good
At bein' on our own
Cause when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you
The way I love you
The way I love you
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
Sing his mercy and his grace
In the mansions bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place
When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be
When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory
Onward to the prize before us
Soon his beauty we'll behold
Soon the pearly gates will open
We shall tread the streets of gold
When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be
When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory
When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory
Tonight doesn't feel like it did last night
I'm feeling warm and different inside
Since I saw your face
Since I looked in your eyes
There's a change in this place
I think the love factor's high
[Chorus]
When the love factor's high
And too hard to collide
You don't even try
And that's when you'll find
The one that feels right
The one for all time
It's hard to deny
When the love factor's high
Sometimes it flies and sometimes it falls
Sometimes your back
Ends up against the wall
As I hold you close
We dance in time
And I think I know the love factor's high
[Chorus]
It's hard to deny
When the love factor's high.
Well I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears
'Round that Jersey Turnpike
When Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said sir you broke the limit in this rusty ol' truck
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab and the lady asked me
How'd you like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
'Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
I was chasin' sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am, back home
We like the girls that sing soprano
'Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch sitiin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Well I was headed home on 

Somewhere around Kentucky
And the CB rang for a bobtail rig
That's rollin' on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might'a seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa
Where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from yeah
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta back porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
A lotta front porch sittin'
Starin' up at heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from
Tryin' to make a livin'
Oh where I come from
Where I come from
Well I know you hate my drinkin'
And the way I talk sometimes
But you hate it most when I don't call at night
And it's just because you lose me
And you worry 'bout your man
You do the best you can with who I am
[Chorus]
Burnin' both ends of a candle
Can leave one in the dark
And I know what I put you through is hard upon your heart
And it's just that you're concerned for me
Sweetheart I understand
You do the best you can with who I am
You go to church on Sunday
While I'm still home in bed
Sleepin' off the night I had before
And sometimes you say I'm perfect
And sometimes not worth a damn
You do the best you can with who I am
[Chorus]
You do the best you can with who I am
Everywhere you look you can write a book
On the trouble of a woman and a man
But you can not impose you can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
I thought I knew her well I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right when she held me tight
How could I be so blind
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
A heart is on the line each and every time
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along it keeps goin' on
As long as you keep in outta sight
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home why do you keep callin'
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying just to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
It's four in the morning and you're all alone
With no place to go you know you ought to come home
And I'll be right here little baby waitin' for you
I know you've been wild and blue
Wild and blue and it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
And they ought to just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Okay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
I didn't buy you a ring I believe it was back in '93
Alright I admit it I forgot our anniversary
I didn't pick the baby this morning at the nursery
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
I'm sorry I was mad for waiting in the truck
It seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
Just to go to Shoney's on a Wednesday night
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus
I think it's soaking in but probably need to re-read it
But I can see now what you've been saying is right
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
I got laid off and we're behind on our bills
I can't cross that picket line down at the mill
I may not have money but I've got my pride
Yeah I know Christmas is just around the corner
And all my love can't keep us any warmer
But look at the bright side
We're both still alive
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
Oh honey just be patient now
I'm a work in progress
A calloused right hand
Holds a shiny gold watch
For thirty rears spent on the clock
But you won't see no tears
From this working class hero
He's always been hard as a rock
But he knows he's too old
To really start over
Besides he just wouldn't know how 
I guess he's just glad
That he's not alone
But he's got to wonder what now
There's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on
Well that three-bedroom house
He build in the '50s
Seems so much bigger today
With just him and mama
And not many bills
'Cause all of the kids moved away
What he's done with his life
Might not be remembered
But he's got every right to be proud
'Cause the blood sweatin' years 
Of this workin' class hero
Is really what livin's about
'Cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a worman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on
Yea, that working class hero lives on
Pine trees grow so tall in the bright sunshine
A young boy steals his daddy's fishin' line
The alligator lays on the banks of a riverbed
And if you didn't know any better you'd swear he's dead
Now these are a few things I'm in love with
A small part of the reason I'd go back
To Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, gorgeous Georgia
Now if you think I'm happy down there you're on the right track
And you ain't just whistlin' Dixie
You ain't just slappin' your knee
I'm a grandson of the Southland
An heir to the Confederacy
You ain't just whistlin' Dixie
'Cause the cattle call's callin' me home
So put me down there where I wanna be
Plant my feet with Robert E. Lee
Bury my bones under a cypress tree
And never let me roam
The cotton balls gleam and the cow gives cream for the baby's sake
And pa comes in full of gin and he's mean as a rattlesnake
And if the well runs dry and we cry and cuss the garden hose
Then mama draws a bucket full of creek water just to wash our clothes
Now these are a few things I'm in love with
A small part of the reason I go back
To Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, gorgeous Georgia
Now if you think I'm happy down there you're on the right track
And you ain't just whistlin' Dixie
You ain't just slappin' your knee
I'm a grandson of the Southland boys
An heir to the Confederacy
You ain't just whistlin' Dixie
'Cause the cattle call's callin' me home
So put me down there where I wanna be
Plant my feet with Robert E. Lee
Bury my bones under a cypress tree
And never let me roam
Spread your wings, don't be afraid to try
The world can be hard, you gotta live a little 'fore you die
So open that door, step out in the bright sunshine
Follow your heart, and remember any time

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

So pack your bags, smile and say goodbye
And chase those dreams, and when you lay down and die
You know that there's someone praying for you every day
Even if you never find your way

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

When I was young, my daddy said to me
The very same words and I took those words with me
When I was afraid, I'd pull them out and think
Just how much they mean to me

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home
The kiss was colder than I remember
When we first said hello
I guess the flame's now a little lower
I can feel you letting go
You know the pain drops a little darker
Then when you first put it on
I guess your love's like some old cheap and magic marker
Said forever nice go
But you don't have to paint me a picture
You don't have to say things at all
You don't have to paint me a picture
I can see in the writing on the wall
When we first fell, we fell a long way
Summer nights and winter days
Mountain sunrise, ocean sunset
Hand in hand in the haze
Now it's cold heart summer evenings
And there's clouds on my sunrise
But you don't have to smile and say you're happy
I can see what's in your eyes
You don't have to paint me a picture
You don't have to say things at all
You don't have to paint me a picture
I can see in the writing on the wall
All your pretty bags are packed
Forever sure did go by fast
I hope you find the skies are blue
The grass is green and the road is smooth
You go your way, c'est la vie sweet baby
Here's hoping that you don't hate me
Who knows, you might just maybe miss me out there
It ain't about who's right or wrong
Love dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
You go your way and I'll go crazy
I poured some bourbon in a coffee cup
It's been too long since I drank too much
So here's to me and here's to the moon
And here's to love that ends too soon
You go your way, c'est la vie sweet baby
Here's hoping that you don't hate me
Who knows, you might just maybe miss me
It ain't about who's right or wrong
Love dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
You go your way and I'll go crazy
Yeah it ain't about who's right or wrong
Love dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
You go your way and I'll go crazy
Yeah I'll go crazy
You can let a gal with freckles on her face
String your blonde hair and a 20 inch waist
Caught my eye like a little red car
She shook my hand and she grabbed my heart

Lord, you never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door

Brunette hair and big brown eyes
Perfect little bottom like a rollercoaster ride
Waiting on her table with her lazy anchor on
Big tip, later, lord she let me drive her home

You never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
You never know, you never know

I was down in Atlanta on a Sunday afternoon
Backed into a Honda with a woman dressed in blue
First she wasn't happy but the chemistry began
Two Daiquiri's later, lord, we're walking hand in hand

You never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door

So the moral to the story is you better be aware
Love might hit you 'fore you ever know it's there
So keep your motor running and keep it in gear
Listen real close she might just whisper in your ear

Hey, you never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
No, you never know, ah, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
If your heart has known such pain
Until for death it's crying
Only to have the lord refuse
Then you've been near my side
 
If in your heart somehow you know
You'll fail whate'er you do
Then you have walked a road of pain
Yes you've been lonesome too
 
If you have had each joy of life
Destroyed and cast away
Then watch a heart that once knew love
Grow sadder day by day
 
If your soul is wilted like a rose
That's never felt the dew
You're traveling on the street of grief
Yes you've been lonesome too
 
If for your wasted wicked life
Your soul cries out in shame
And you could live it all again
It'd never be the same
 
If you've cried "god please bless the one
To whom I was untrue"
You've lived the life of regret
Yes you've been lonesome too
 
If when the storms light up the skies
It seems you can't go on
Then from a vision your darling comes
You speak but she is gone
 
If then the tears flood down your cheeks
There's no one else for you
Then you can't ever hide from fate
Yes you've been lonesome too
I know your leavin'
I see the signs
You're gonna walk out on this heart of mine
You'll never call me
You'll never write
You've made your mind up, your gone tonight
If some rainy day you're all alone
You feel like talking, you can log me on
[Chorus]
At www.memory,
I'll be waiting for you patiently
If you feel the need, just click on me
At www.memory
You won't even have to hold me
Or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me
Through your keyboard and wires
No, you won't have to touch me
Or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around
Until you see it land
[Chorus]
If you feel like love, just click on me
At www.memory
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
And to take him at his word
Just to rest upon his promise
And to know, thus saith the Lord
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him
How I've proved him o'er and o'er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
O for grace to trust him more
I'm so glad I learned to trust thee
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend
And I know that thou art with me
Wilt be with me to the end
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him
How I've proved him o'er and o'er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
O for grace to trust him more
A stark-naked light bulb hangs over my head
There's one lonely pillow on my double bed
I've got a ceiling, a floor and four walls
Who says you can't have it all
My room's decorated with pictures of you
Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues
I've got precious memories at my beck and call
Who says you can't have it all
I've got everything a broken heart needs
Oh, I'm doin' fine don't you worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm Lord and Master
Of a fool's Taj Mahal
Who says you can't have it all
I've got everything a broken heart needs
Oh, I'm doin' fine don't you worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm Lord and Master
Of a fool's Taj Mahal
Who says you can't have it all
Oh, who says you can't have it all
Rocky burned up the movie screen, and I was turnin' seventeen
Tie-dyed shirts and Levis jeans, lookin' cool at the Dairy Queen
Tryin' to impress a young woman in her Sunday dress
[Chorus]
And that was 1976, didn't know who I was yet
A pretty little blonde haired girl stole my heart and changed my world
Two kids and a moonlit sky, a little love on a Friday night
Built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976
My high school days I packed away, set my sights on a bigger stage
Jimmy Carter moved to DC, a Georgia boy just like me, 
Life seemed easy, nothin' much that we needed
[Chorus]
Eight track tapes were still in style and Elvis was still alive
Wonder Woman sure looked fine, Bionic Man was still Prime Time
And that girl I liked, we kept on tryin' 'till we got it right
[Chorus]
Yeah, that was 1976, didn't know who we were yet
Built a fire that just wont quit and that was 1976
We built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976.
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
It's the best time of the year 
Well I don't know if there'll be snow 
But have a cup of cheer 
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And when you walk down the street 
Say hello to friends you know 
And everyone you meet 
Ho ho the mistletoe 
Hung where you can see 
Somebody waits for you 
Kiss her once for me 
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And in case you didn't hear 
Oh by-golly have a holly jolly Christmas 
This year 
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And when you walk down the street 
Say hello to friends you know 
And everyone you meet 
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And in case you didn't hear 
Oh by-golly have a holly jolly Christmas 
This year
We still were our rings
We still say I love you
We both play the part oh so well
But everyone knows
It's just a sad show
And we're only foolin' ourselves
It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide
We could pack up and leave in different directions
If we just had somewhere to go
We just keep on pretending
Afraid of the ending
Admitting what everyone knows
It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide
You can turn out the lights
In a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide
Well tonight if you turn your radio on
You might hear a sad, sad song
About someone who lost everything they had
It may sound like me
But I'm a little bluer than that
When you look out in the morning you might see
Clouds rollin' by like memories
And a big old sky above you lookin' back
You may think of me
But I'm a little bluer than that
Where did we go wrong
I wish I knew
It haunts me all the time
Now wherever I go and
Whatever I do
You're always on my mind
I can picture you in his arms tonight
But as for me it don't feel right
To let us fade like some old photograph
It may work for you
But I'm a little bluer than that
Where did we go wrong
I wish I knew
It haunts me all the time
Now wherever I go and
Whatever I do
You're always on my mind
So tonight if you turn your radio on
You might hear a sad, sad song
About someone who lost everything they had
It may sound like me
But I'm a little bluer than that
You may think of me
But I'm a little bluer than that
Well I've been wonderin' what I've been missin' I guess I should have known
But my heart does and it ain't whisperin' it tells me just what it wants
Someone who knows what I like in my coffee
And the shape of my ol' hat
A lover who always looks at me not through me
I need a love like that
[Chorus]
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
I need a love like that
Well I need a new car but I can't afford it
So I keep patchin' that ol' flat
My heart's lonely and I can't ignore it
I need a love like that
[Chorus]
Yeah, I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
I need a love like that
Two young people dancin' in the daylight
They don't care where they're at
Waitin' sunset holdin' on so tight
I need a love like that
[Chorus]
One little baby hidin in the shadow
Of her daddy's hat
Lovin' and trustin' blindly she'll follow
I need a love like that
[Chorus]
Yeah, a truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
And I need a love like that
I have felt it
And I have held it
I have known
A woman's love
I have tasted
And I have wasted
A woman's love
And I know
I'll never understand
All the little things
that make It grand
A woman's love
And I know
I'll never come Face to face
With any thing
that takes the Place
Of a woman's love
Well I have kiss it
Tried to resist it
I have missed
A woman's love
And I have hated
Taken for granted
A woman's love
Well I have needed
And I have pleaded
And I have lost
A woman's love
And I have worshipped
And I have cursed it
A woman's love
Well I adore it
Thank god for it
A woman's love
Love's a gamble every heart will take
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance
And won a whole lot more than one night of romance
[Chorus]
I won the ace of hearts,that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold the winning hand any way life deals the cards
No way to lose, cause I've got you my ace of hearts
Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
Cause loving you is paying off more than I knew
I took a little risk and hit it big with you
[Chorus]
Her right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more
All the ribbons all the bows, in a box now on her closet floor
Anxious for what's to come
Afraid to leave a place she loves
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Broken hearts and rusted dreams
Sometimes make it hard to leave and
Certainty is out of reach even with some self belief
So she bites her lip and shows a smile
Flips her hair and flaunts her style
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Her memories she stowed away
Pulls them out on rainy days
And brand new faces take their place, beside the ones that never fade
Shes strong and fragile, weak and smart
Whatever the cost she plays the part
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Her right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more.
I work a forty hour week and I earn my keep
And I try to walk proud and tall
I keep my nose to the grind, I don't get behind
And I don't back up at all
Well my neck's a little red, my collar's blue
I sip a little coffee and I drink a little booze
[Chorus]
Cause I'm an all American country boy
I'm my daddy's spittin' image and my mama's pride and joy
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
Cause I'm an all American country boy
I drive a pickup truck and I don't pass the buck
And I always speak my mind
I'm hooked on TV, Rolaids and B.C.'s
And I know how to have a good time
I'm a little bit rowdy and a little bit tame
Ain't no way I'm ever gonna change
[Chorus]
Well I must admit that I've mellowed a bit
Father time can slow you down
I'm still doin' all I used to do
It just takes a little longer now
[Chorus]
I'm just a country boy
A good ol' country boy
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimple's who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
That I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight
All my exes live in Texas (Yes they do)
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
Therefore I reside in Tennessee
Some folks think I'm hidin'
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee
The time has come, you're really leavin'
You always told me that you wanted to
I guess I never thought it would happen
I guess I never really wanted it to
The world is callin' you and you must answer
But you can take me with you in your dreams, and
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waiting for you
Your sister told me you were working
At some office out in Tinseltown
But don't forget about those who love you
They'll be there for you if you get down
I believe in you in all you after
I hope you end up where you want to be
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waiting for you
Thirty years now have gone by quickly
I still think of you from time to time
My wife died early, I've got children
I'm happy and my health is fine
I often wondered if you found your freedom
I sometimes wonder if I should have gone
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
You can't mix angels and alcohol
I don't think God meant for them to get along
When it takes control, you can't love no one at all
You can't mix angels and alcohol

You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love
They don't go together, love's already hard enough
You think you can handle, how it feels or what it does
You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love

You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine
It might ease the heartache for one short easy time
In the end you have to face what's hiding in your mind
You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine

You can't mix angels and alcohol
An angel once loved me, I traded it all
I let the bottle drive my life into a wall
You can't mix angels, and alcohol
I woke up the other night lyin' on the floor
Just because of what I said before
She said, "My name's Juliet, but Romeo you ain't"
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober, I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this, I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink
I can't go see my best friend, he said stay away
Just because of what I said on his wedding day
"You ought to call her Sherman, 'cause she looks just like a tank"
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober, I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this, I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink
I'm gonna sue the city about that police man
Last night as I left the bar, he stepped right on my hand
He, "Are you drunk or blind"; I said, "Let me think"
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober, I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this, I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober, I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this, I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason
Baby, let me in, I'm freezin'
Another good reason not to drink
I've been ridin' these blue highways
Another night has made me stop
My weary bones can go no farther
And here is where they'll drop

In my dreams your arms will find me 
They will hold me through the night
Then release me to my journey
As another day grows light

Chorus

I've got so many miles to go 
And promises to keep
Right now all I want to do
Is be anywhere on earth you are

I have always been a gypsy 
And the road call me to roam
But each day brings me closer
To the place where we call home

Repeat Chorus

In my dreams your arms will find me 
They will hold me through the night
Right now all I want to do 
Is be anywhere on earth you are
Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
Are you washed in the blood
In the soul-cleansing blood of the lamb?
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin
And be washed in the blood of the lamb
There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean
O, be washed in the blood of the lamb
Are you washed in the blood
In the soul-cleansing blood of the lamb?
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
A big moon is risin? so bright in the sky
But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes
It rises above me so bright and so blue
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you

Take me into the night
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you more than I can show you
More than I could know in my heart

So lay down beside me and hold me tonight
For your love has found me and it feels so right
These thoughts in my mind are so scattered and few
But I won't see anyone as lovely as you

Take me into the night
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you more than I could show you
More than I could know in my heart

In my heart
We never spoke a word
But every thought she had I heard from across the room
If we were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love
As she's walking away
Wise man next to me did say
'Bout the one that got away
Son I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance, go on son
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith
And don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love
As she's walking away
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith
And don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Don't be falling, falling, falling in love
As she's walking away
Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.
I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
This world can take you by the hand
And tempt the soul of any man
You can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one is wrong
The flesh is weak
But love is strong
She's all I see between the Devil and me
The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
I'll be your friend
Because again I know it's him
The flames are spreading everywhere
Through the smoke I see you there
She's all I see between the Devil and me
I hold her in my arms at night
So safe and warm I close my eyes
And a cool breeze blows 'cross our bodies in the dark
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know the fire burns
She's all I see between the Devil and me
The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
I'll be your friend
Because again I know it's him
The flames are spreading everywhere
Through the smoke I see you there
She's all I see between the Devil and me
The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
She's all I see between the Devil and me
Oh I'm blessed and I know I am
God has dealt me a winning hand
A loving woman and a fairy land for me
Oh and I can't believe it half the time
When I look at her in perfect light
Sweet vision every day and night I see
[Chorus]
My baby has big green eyes
Brighter than the bluest sky
Softer than an angel flies
Sweeter than a lullaby
And she loves me without design
Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine
Baby and her big green eyes
Oh and I'm never very far away
Even if I'm in another place
Her smile you can't erase from me
[Chorus]
Oh and I'm thankful every waking hour
For the love of a gentle flower
A face I will never tire or leave
[Chorus]
Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine
Baby and her big green eyes
Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do? Tell me, what did I do to be so black and blue?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
This ain't no song about the good old days
'Cept for times and the easy ways
Or how I long for an old dirt road
Greener grass or a lighter load
I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in sixty-five
Yeah, I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes
Rain would fall and the mud would rise
Through my toes in the summer time
August heat would dry that clay
Dust went flying like a dandelion
I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in sixty-five
Yeah, I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes
Stubbed my toes on rocks and stones
Slipped and fell in old potholes
Watched my mama shake that line
Dust them clothes off hanging in the hot sunshine
I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in sixty-five
Yeah, I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes
Blessed assurance Jesus is mine
O what a foretaste of glory divine
Heir of salvation, purchase of God
Born of his spirit washed in his blood
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
Perfect submission, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight
Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
Praising my Savior all the day long
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
The lady I love loves silk and satin
She was raised uptown with a silver spoon
Well, I was born on a farm just south of Jackson
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She's Saks Fifth Avenue perfection
Caviar and dignified
Well, I live my life in WalMart fashion
And I like my sushi southern fried
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She's a blue blooded woman, I'm a redneck man
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
It was on one moonlit night, stars shinin' bright
Whispered on high, love said goodbye
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, it was on one moonlit night, stars shinin' bright
Whispered on high, your lover said goodbye
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Left me blue
Left me blue
Left me blue
He met her in the fall of '93 in the hills of Tennessee
She was barely 17, he was tall and strong and lean
They were deep in love by June
Hand in hand beneath that moon
And she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On a hillside all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
She married in her mama's wedding gown
Bought a house and settled down
He worked driving all around
All at large from town to town
And he'd come home every night
And she'd be waiting in the front porch light
And she'd sing a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On the front porch all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
They couldn't tell him what was wrong
But they just didn't know
It wasn't very long until Jesus called her home
And he got down on his knees
Said "God don't take my love from me"
Just let her sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Like she has all along
And I'll dance with her till dawn
On a hill side all alone
And we'll spend eternity like a mountain melody
In love as we can be
Singing that blue ridge song
Now he lives there all alone
In the house that they call home
In his heart there lies a void (?)
From the absence of her voice
And he lays down every night
Dreams about that front porch light
Where she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night until dawn
On the hillside all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
Little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ride mountain song
Little blue ridge mountain song
I'm lost in the night
The icy wind is howlin' out your name
And desolation linger like the fog
The fire is growing dimmer
In the wind
I'm out in the rain
The moon has gone behind
The cloud again
And I can't stand to live another day
'Cause my bluebird went away
And I am locked in this room with my sorrow
No escape, no way to get away
And my only connection
With tomorrow
Is hoping that you might decide
Not to stay away
Oh, I'm out on a limb
If I could only find sweet love again
To live my life this way
Is too much to bear
Can't find my bluebird anywhere
I'm out in the rain
The moon has gone behind
The cloud again
And I can't stand to live another day
Bluebird why'd you go away,
Bluebird why'd you go away
It's time for a change
I'm tired of that same ol' same
The same ol' words the same ol' lines
The same ol' tricks and the same ol' rhymes
Days precious days
Roll in and out like waves
I got boards to bend I got planks to nail
I got charts to make I got seas to sail
I'm gonna build me a boat
With these two hands
It'll be a fair curve
From a noble plan
Let the chips fall where they will
'Cause I've got boats to build
Sails are just like wings
The wind can make 'em sing
Songs of life songs of hope
Songs to keep your dreams afloat
I'm gonna build me a boat
With these two hands
It'll be a fair curve
From a noble plan
Let the chips fall where they will
'Cause I've got boats to build
Shores distant shores
There's where I'm headed for
Got the stars to guide my way
Sail into the light of day
I'm gonna build me a boat
With these two hands
It'll be a fair curve
From a noble plan
Let the chips fall where they will
'Cause I've got boats to build
It's twilight and the streets 
Light are coming on
I'm in a stream of cars
On this Boulevard, headed home
I can hardly wait
You can make what went wrong today
Seam right
Bring on the night
It's been a long hard day
So bring on the night
Bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world out side
And throw the key away
Turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
Lets call it a day
And bring on the night
From nine to five it's the same ole grind
All week long
And the only thing
That keeps sane, is coming home
When the sun goes down
You know how to set things right
Lets put the day behind us
And bring on the night
Bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world out side
And throw the key away
Turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
Lets call it a day
And bring on the night
Lets call it a day
And bring on the night
How long will I love you
I don't really know
I'd like to think forever
Is how far we could go so let me paint a picture
Of how it's gonna be
The day you don't mean everything to me
When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship
On waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
And I stop lovin' you
Honey they'll be driving
Buicks to the moon
Now you don't have to worry
About what comes to pass
This old world may wear out
But my love's gonna last
If they ever build that highway to the moon
I'll just fond somethin' else to promise you
When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship
On waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
And I stop lovin' you
Honey they'll be driving
Buicks to the moon
Oh when the stars have all been counted
And I stop lovin' you
Honey they'll be drivin'
Buicks to the moon
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Burnin' the honky tonks down
Smoke's been rising all over town
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She caught me runnin' around
She was dancin' in the ashes
When they caught her with them matches
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Well she's burnin' the honky tonks down
I tried but I could not put them out
Did the best to save the whiskey
But the flame's just too risky
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She couldn't stop that honky tonk sound
It was sizzlin' like a griddle
When I ran out with my fiddle
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's down in the jailhouse now
Said she felt no remorse
For breakin' out that torch
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Burnin' the honky tonks down
Smoke's been a rising all over town
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Daddy won a radio and tuned it to a country show 
I was rockin' in the cradle to the cryin' of a steel guitar 
Mama used to sing to me, she taught me that sweet harmony 
Now she worries 'cause she never thought I'd ever really take it this far 
Singin' in the bars and 
Chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream 
'Cause all I've ever wanted, is to pick this guitar and sing 
Just tryin' to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen 
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream 
An atlas and a coffee cup, five pickers in an old Dodge truck 
Headin' down to Houston for a show on Saturday night 
This overhead is killin' me, half the time I sing for free 
But when the crowd's into it Lord it makes this thing I'm doing seem right 
Standin' in the spotlight 
Chasin' that neon rainbow, I'm livin' that honky tonk dream 
'Cause all I've ever wanted, is to pick this guitar and sing 
Just tryin' to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen 
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream 
Daddy's got a radio, he won it thirty years ago 
He said "Son I just know we're gonna hear you singin' on it someday" 
I made it up to Music Row, but Lordy don't the wheels turn slow 
Still I wouldn't take a minute and I wouldn't have it any other way 
Just show me to the stage 
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow, i'm livin' that honky tonk dream 
'Cause all I've ever wanted, is to pick this guitar and sing 
Just tryin' to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen 
Chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream 
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream
Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.
Excuse me ma'am, I saw you walkin'
I turned around, I'm not a stalker
Where you going? Maybe I can help you
My tank is full, I'd be obliged to take you
'Cause I'm a country boy, I've got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed, I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
You sure look good, sittin' in my right seat
Buckle up, and I'll take you through the five speeds
Wind it up, or I can slow it way down
In the woods or right uptown
I'm a country boy, I've got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed, I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
Big 35's whinin' on the asphalt
Grabbin' mud, and slingin' up some red dirt
'Cause I'm a country boy
My muffler's loud, dual thrush tubes
I crank the music, the tone gets real good
Let me know when we're gettin' close
You can slide on out, or we can head on down the road
'Cause I'm a country boy, I've got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed, I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you want to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
Bucket seats, soft as baby's new butt
Lockin' hubs, that'll take you through a deep rut
'Cause I'm a country boy, I've got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed, I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down winding roads
I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
Yeah
Yeah I'm a country boy, I've got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed, I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you want to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
Yeah, I'm a country boy,
Oh, I'm just a country boy,
A nice little country boy.
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Lord I hope the gold band on her hand
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Oh if Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She said I don't usually dance this close to strangers
You know a girl can't be too careful with her heart
But I saw you and thought that you looked harmless
When you smile that way I'm not so sure you are
I said I don't usually come here for the dancin', 
You can tell that by the way I move, When I saw you
I thought that it was hopeless
And I just had to ask you for a dance or two
Somewhere in the stars it must be written,
Girl we've got to take this chance that we've been given, 
If there's a heaven here on Earth 
I think we found it
If this ain't love, we're dancin' all around it.
Music stopped and we're still holdin' each other, 
This feels like the beginning of forever,
Somewhere in the stars it must be written,
Girl we've got to take this chance that we've been given, 
If there's a heaven here on Earth 
I think we found it
If this ain't love, we're dancin' all around it.
She said I don't usually dance this close to strangers
Here's my keys, I want you to take 'em 
I think I'm gonna need you to get back home 
Hold on to my hat, I don't wanna lose it 
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone 
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin' 
I think you'll understand why  
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm the designated drinker 
I just lost the one that wrapped me around her finger 
I need to get to where I can't think of her 
So tonight, I'm the designated drinker 
I came here to get you to help me 
I need a friend to see me through 
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all 
I know you know I'd do the same for you 
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrow 
I may hate myself tomorrow 
Oh but
[Chorus]
We need to get to where we can't think of her 
So tonight we're the designated drinkers 
Oh tonight, we're the designated drinkers
I was born on the Dixie Highway, red play and Georgy pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place you'll ever find
Wood frame house and grandma driveway
Willow trees on our front porch
Just outside the city limits, on the highway thirty four 
Yeah I was born on the Dixie Highway, red play and Georgy pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place you'll ever find (you'll never find it)
And having tobacco rolling on the roadside
Rolled it up and we smoked it down
Don't feel much, but it makes you feel big
When you're ten years old in a tiny town
Yeah I was born on the Dixie Highway, red play and Georgy pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place you'll ever find
Have a chicken meal right in the backyard
Close line running east to west
Water bane to make a garden, six days and a sun to rest
Yeah I was born (I was born) on the Dixie Highway (Dixie Highway), red play and Georgy pines
I was raised (I was raised) on the Dixie Highway (Dixie Highway), no sweeter place you'll ever find
Summertime, hot and hazy, bare feet and a water hose
Melon and lime on a country table
Lighting the buds when the sun goes down
I was born (yeah, I was born) on the Dixie Highway , red play and Georgy pines
I was raised (yeah, I was raised) on the Dixie Highway (on the Dixie Highway), no sweeter place you'll ever find
And the holy ghost on a Sunday morning,
Gospel songs and a Bible read
Sunday lunch at momma's table, praying for Lord and break the bread
I was born (I was born) on the Dixie Highway, red play and Georgy pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place you'll ever find
I screamed in porch right at the backdoor,
Washing machine and an old, wood stove
Momma's singing in the kitchen, rolling homemade biscuit dough
I was born (yeah, I was born) on the Dixie Highway (on the Dixie Highway), red play and Georgy pines
I was raised (yeah, I was raised) on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place 
When I'm old and Heaven's calling
And they come to care me away
Just lay me down, down in soft land
Here where me and Jordan play
Yeah I was born on the Dixie Highway, red play and Georgy pines
I was raised (yeah, I was raised) on the Dixie Highway, no sweeter place you'll ever find
No sweeter place you'll ever find
No sweeter place you'll ever find
Well I first kissed you on a hollow log
Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
Well we married that spring and we built a house
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you've long gone
You left me and the river here all alone
[Chorus]
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the gall
And washed your picture right off the wall
[Chorus]
Well my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
So if you change your mind honey I'll be here
Waiting on the banks of that ol' Dog River
[Chorus]
Ask me any kind of question
Anything you wanna know
Tell you all about my lovers
Heartaches and laughter
From a long time ago
Ask me if I'm finally happy
I've never really been before
Ever since you happened to me
I've told all my secrets
I don't have anymore
Ask me now
And I won't tell a lie
Ask me how
I've been feelin' inside
When somebody loves you
You know that it's true
Don't ask why
And ask me if I really mean it
When I tell you I love you
Ask me will I please repeat it
I'll tell you forever if you want me to
And ask me now
And I won't tell a lie
Ask me how
I've been feelin' inside
When somebody loves you
And you know that it's true
Don't ask why
Now don't ask why
It's painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
Put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten
It was just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it make me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
Couple of burned valves and he had it going
He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, a little slower son you're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive
I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile, and say
Just an old worn-out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
Daddy let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson with electric choke
The love you thought was dead and gone  
Somehow keeps on hanging on  
Even when your heart has left it far behind  
Just when you have turned the page  
It seems to find a way  
There it is again  
Every now and then  
 
[Chorus]
And every now and then that old feeling comes around  
Every now and then I see your face in another cloud  
And every now and then some old something takes me right back again  
Every now and then  
 
You can finally breathe life in  
Without wondering where she's been  
Go to sleep at night without her on your mind  
In a second it appears  
Followed by familiar tears  
Like a long lost friend  
Every now and then  
 
[Chorus]
 
And I know it's all for nothing  
There's no going back to way back then  
 
[Chorus]
 
I still love you  
Every now and then
It's hard to describe 
You're like nothing I've ever known in my life 
Time is flowing from down deep the sunrise 
So selfness and complete 
You did hear it now 
All around you not a single cloud 
Like the rain it stops for it it's ground 
And puddles at your feet 
You're an angel 
I know heaven wonders where you are 
Like you fell of some old shining star 
Riding to my heart 
An angel, 
When I'm with you I feel like a king 
Just like out of some old movie scene 
An angel, everything but the wings 
Looking at you 
It's hard to believe that you could feel the way I do 
Never thought I'd find so much love we're falling to 
Or perfect or true 
So never go away 
If heaven calls you back if ask if you can stay 
I never find someone to ever take your place 
You know the only made a few 
'Cause you're an angel 
I know heaven wonders where you are 
Like you fell of some old shining star 
Riding to my heart 
An angel, 
When I'm with you I feel like a king 
Just like out of some old movie scene 
An angel, everything but the wings
Everything but the wings
An angel, everything but the wings
I was fifteen, she was eighteen
The prettiest thing I'd ever seen in my life
I loved her at first sight
I found her in Marietta, a town north of Atlanta
I brought her home to see my folks
They loved her too
We were together for a long time
Thought it would be for all time
But things change and rearrange
She had to go
She left me cryin' in '79
An airline pilot, in Carolina
I was a wreck, can't drive a check
It broke my heart
My first love was an older woman
There's been many since
But there'll never be another
Built in 1955, snowshoe white, overdrive
I never should've sold her, I'll always love her
She was mine
Years went by, teardrops dried
I got her back, I was surprised
In '93, a gift to me on Christmas Eve
We were both older, so I restored her
Could've sold her, for a lot more
But I will never she's mine forever
Until I go
My first love was an older woman
There's been many since
But there'll never be another
Built in 1955, snowshoe white, overdrive
I never should've sold her, I'll always love her
She was mine
I'll never sell her she's mine forever
I love her so
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow,
An' so am I.
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime,
But it's July.
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute.
My boss just pushed me over the limit.
I'd like to call him somethin', 
I think I'll just call it a day.
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong,
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane.
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care.
It's five o'clock somewhere.
Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon,
An' half the night.
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay,
Hey, but that's all right.
I ain't had a day off now in over a year.
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here.
Hit the 'phones for me,
You can tell 'em I just sailed away.
An' pour me somethin' tall an' strong,
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane.
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care.
It's five o'clock somewhere.
I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab,
An' be back to work before two.
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder,
What would Jimmy Buffet do?
Funny you should ask that because I'd say:
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong,
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane.
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care.
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong,
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane.
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care.
He don't care.
I don't care.
It's five o'clock somewhere.
What time zone am on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere.
It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it.
Yeah, I heard that.
You been there haven't you.
Yes sir.
I seen your boat there.
I've been to Margaritaville a few times.
All right, that's good.
Stumbled all the way back.
OK. Just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons.
Bring the booze, I tell you.
All right. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere.
I'm ready, crank it up.
Let's get out of here.
I'm gone.
Let's get out of here.
Flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no tens
All them flaws
Ones you came with or you caused them
Scars or tattoos that went rotten
We all got flaws

The woman that I love, she's purer than a dove
I know her best than anyone I guess
The thing I like the most, the wrinkle on her nose
And all the little parts that are unique

All her flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no tens
All them flaws
Ones you came with, or you caused them
Scars or tattoos that went rotten
We all got flaws, aw, yeah

Yeah, I look at my two eyes
Left higher than the right
I guess that's just the way I'm supposed to be
I snore when I'm asleep, got long and lanky feet
The pieces of the puzzle that I am

All my flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no tens
All them flaws
Ones you came with or you caused them
Scars or tattoos that went rotten
We all got them flaws

So, never be ashamed, embarrassed or afraid
'Cause everyone has something they don't like
Remember we're all made with water, dirt and grace
We're all perfect in the eyes that see

All our flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no tens
All them flaws
Ones you came with or you caused them
Scars or tattoos that went rotten
We all got flaws
We all got flaws
Everybody's got a few flaws, flaws, flaws, yeah
Nobody's perfect
Just another bar
With loud guitars
Smoke and candles burning low
And the same ol' boys
Their backs to the bar
Staring across a crowded floor
Then I hear a familiar sound
Your voice laughing out loud
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
So I take a chair
In a corner somewhere
You can't see me
But I can look at you
And I remember those times
When I looked in your eyes
The way that he now looks at you
Deep down I know it's over
But it hurts me when he's so much closer
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
And if I can't hold you near me
I'll just hold onto your memory
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
I'll always love you from a distance
I had a dream last night
I was floating down that black water
Kick back on the Mississippi
On a raft with ol' Tom Sawyer
He got restless down around Memphis
That's where he left me
Said I'm one rambling man
I was gone before you met me

And there I was back in my hometown
That's just how dreams go
Thumb in the air wanted out of there
Heading my own road
Well I hitched a ride with this beatnik guy
Said looks like you read me
My name is Jack Kerouac
I was gone before you met me

You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
You fix that roof but your roots to the ground-boys
Pink house, the white fence
Pretty little woman, two point five
Kids, dang right, it's a good life
With boys like me your bound to run the wild side
Like the restless wind you'll never catch me
I was gone before you met me

And just before I awoke
I had a bad nightmare
I was on some lost highway and you were nowhere near
Someone took your hand I wasn't that man
Girl, it sure did hit me
I was cussing fate but it was too late
You were gone before you met me

Yeah, I smelled that coffee
I heard you singing in the kitchen
Walking in got a kiss, you said the sink still dripping
Thank God I'm still driven

You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
You fix that sink but your roots to the ground-boys
Blue house, the white fence
Sweet little woman, rocking that good
Miss dang right, it's a fine life
His restless heart found a heart I can call mine
I was smart enough to let love catch me

So Tom and Jack just ramled on without me
'Cause I was gone before you met me
Gone gone, gone before you met me
Gone before you met me
She's been playing in a room on the strip for ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
She's been readin' about Nashville and all the records that everybody's buying
Says, I'm a simple girl myself, grew up on Long Island
So she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance
She's gone country, look at them boots
She's gone country, back to her roots
She's gone country, a new kind of suit
She's gone counrty, here she comes
Well, the folk scene's dead, but he's holding out in the Village
He's been writing songs, speaking out against wealth and privilege
He says, I don't believe in money, but a man could make him a killin'
'Cause some of that stuff don't sound much different than Dylan
I hear down there it's changed, you see
Well, they're not as backward as they used to be
He's gone country, look at them boots
He's gone country, back to his roots
He's gone country, a new kind of suit
He's gone country, here he comes
He commutes to L.A., but he's got a house in the Valley
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just ain't on the rally
And he says, honey, I'm a serious composer, schooled in voice and composition
But with the crime and the smog these days, this ain't no place for children
Lord, it sounds so easy, this shouldn't take long
Be back in the money in no time at all
He's gone country, look at them boots
He's gone country, back to his roots
He's gone country, a new kind of suit
He's gone country, here he comes
Yeah, he's gone country, a new kind of walk
He's gone country, a new kind of talk
He's gone country, look at them boots
He's gone country, oh, back to his roots
He's gone country
He's gone country
Everybody's gone country
Yeah, we've gone county
The whole world's gone country
Let me just say for the sake of conversation 
If it's hard to think as reincarnation 
But don't you go crying for me when I'm gone 
Told them I'm gonna come back as a country song 
I'll be playing all night in every hunky town bar 
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar 
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home 
I'm gonna come back as a country song 
I don't have to save me, Heaven and me 
Watching neon lights for eternity! 
So go ahead and put it on my headstone 
Yeah, I'm gonna come back as a country song 
I'll be playing all night in every hunky town bar 
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar 
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home 
I'm gonna come back as a country song 
So here I am almost two tonight 
Yeah I'm practicing for the after life 
'Cause when I'm nothing but a pile of bones 
I'm gonna come back as a country song 
I'll be playing all night in every hunky town bar 
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar 
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home 
I'm gonna come back as a country song
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home 
I'm gonna come back as a country song
You called it quits
And hung up the phone
Now go love
The one you choose
And my friends say I should be happy
But if I'm happy
This is a good imitation of the blues
You threatened to leave
One too many times
I'm gettin' out
My travelin' shoes
And now that you're gone
I'm gonna be walkin' on
With this good imitation of the blues
My friends all say
You're no good without me
They tell me
That's good for you
And they say that I'm
Just feelin' fine
With this good imitation of the blues
You threatened to leave
One too many times
I'm gettin' out
My travelin' shoes
And now that you're gone
I'm gonna be walkin' on
With this good imitation of the blues
(Good time)
Work, work all week long
Punchin' that clock from dusk 'till dawn
Countin' the days 'till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time
Yeah, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time
I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun goin' down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time,
Oh, I need a good time
I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time
Hey!
Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ol' Hank taught us about
Singin' along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends all night long
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time
Yeah, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time
Woah
Heel toe dosey doe
Scootin' our boots, swingin' doors
B n' D Kix and Dunn
Honkin' tonk heaven, double shotgun
Good time
Lord, we're havin' a good time
'Cause I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time
Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with an D
T with n' I and an M and n' E
And a good time
Good time
I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time
A Shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To sit on my lap
A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time
Oh, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time
Twelve o'clock, two o'clock three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know were that's gonna go
Closing the door, shuttin' 'em down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time
Oh, we're havin' a good time
Oh, I've been workin' all week

It's time for a good time
Oh, yeah, a good time
I need a good time
Yeah, a good time
I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them
But at least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it, that's so much more than I can say for me
It's been a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we haven't said
While a million thoughts go runnin' through my mind, I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses
My baby don't stand no cheating, my Babe
My baby don't stand no cheating, my Babe
Well, my babe don't stand no cheating,
Don't stand none of that midnight creepin', my Babe
Lord, what a woman my baby, babe.
Yeah, my babe, I know she loves me, my babe
Yeah, my babe, I know she loves me, my babe
Well, my babe, I know she loves me,
She don't do nothing but kiss and hug me, my babe,
Lord, what a woman my baby, babe
My baby don't stand no foolin', my babe
My baby don't stand no foolin', my babe
Well, my baby don't stand no foolin'
When she's hot there aint no coolin', my babe,
Lord, what a woman my baby, babe.
Yeah, I said my babe I know she love me, my babe
My babe I know she love me, my babe
Well, my babe I know she love me
She don't do nothin' but kiss and hug me,
Lord, what a woman my baby babe.
Oh my babe, oh my babe, yeah, my babe
I think that I just wrote my first country song
I've had this lonesome hurtin' feeling all night long
I didn't know I loved her and now she's gone
I think that I just wrote my first country song
I always like to hear those country singers sing
And the way they play those guitars boy they sure do make 'em ring
But when they sing the words I can never sing along
I didn't believe things happen that way I thought our love was here to stay
'Till yesterday she walked away and now they're hittin' home
I think that I just wrote
I wrote some words about the good times that we had
And then some lines about losin' my mind or missin' you so bad
And I did leave out a thing about the way you done me wrong
And I sang my song to the saddest note that anybody ever wrote
And I think that I just wrote my first country song
I think that I just wrote
You keep saying you love me and I know it's not true
You just don't want to hurt me I respect that in you
You're in love with another and you won't let it show
Oh I hate to admit it but it's sure my heart knows
I thought I'd won when he lost you I thought you'd forget
But there's still one old mem'ry that you haven't lost yet
I know I'd die when I lose you I know I won't let you go
For you'd never be happy this is true my heart knows
[ steel ]
So goodbye and God bless you I'm setting you free
Just to know you'd be happy means so much to me
I know I'd die when I lose you I know I must let you go
For you'll never be happy this is true my heart knows
My one and only you
I'll never make you cry
I'll never make you blue
My one and only you.
My one and only you
For us there will be a sad goodbye
I'll never make you cry
My one and only you.
Each time you cry
I try to brush your tears aside
Well for when you cry, I die
A slow death inside.
My one and only you
For us there will be a sad goodbye
I'll never make you cry
My one and only you.
Each time you cry
I try to brush your tears aside
Well for when you cry, I die
A slow death inside.
My one and only you
For us there will be a sad goodbye
I'll never make you cry
My one and only you
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met
I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
 
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met
I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
 
After all this time of being alone
We can love on another
Feel for each other from now on
Feels so good I can hardly stand it
 
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met, I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love to you
 
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met, I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love to you
 
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met
I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
See her there at the table
Watch her tear at the label
From the bottle that she just drank dry
In her mind, there's a burning
It took a long time but she's learning
And just look at the teardrops she's cried
Everybody knows I love her
But her mind is on another
And just look what he's done to her pride
And if she should change her mind
Give up the music and the wine
I'll be standing by to be the next in line
I know her favorite songs so well
And she's happy, I can tell
Just as long as she can hear the jukebox play
So I'll keep playing it loud
I'll spend every dime I have
To keep her happy in my own kind of way
Everybody knows I love her
But her mind is on another
And just look what he's done to her pride
And if she should change her mind
Give up the music and the wine
I'll be standing by to be the next in line
You're nobody with no one to care
You're nobody with no one to share
You'll find that dreams are your destiny
You're nobody to no one but me.
You're nobody with no lips to kiss
You're nobody with no one to miss
You'll find that dreams are your destiny
You're nobody to no one but me.
No one to all when you're alone
No one to be your very own
No one to kiss and hold you tight
No one to hold you through the night.
You're nobody without memories
But to somebody you're everything
His hope, his laughter, his destiny
And darlin', that someone is me
(Spoken)
You know I've always tried
To never take love for granted
As you know. 'Cause if you ever
Said goodbye why, I just don't know
What I'd ever do with out you. baby.
(Sang)
Well, all of the friends we know
Are lettin' each other go, there own way
Will they ever find love again
Or will the whole world end up lonely?
Cause baby, just as sure as that old sun'll go down
Somewhere tonight you'll hear a heart breakin' sound
Maybe this'll be a lonely old town
If there's not enough love to go 'round.
(Spoken)
Sometimes it's just a little hard
To keep a love like ours together.
But I promise you one thing, girl
No matter what, I'm gonna love you forever.
(Sang)
All up and down street
Are people who really need each other
And only a lucky few
Learn how to hold onto each other.
Cause baby, just as sure as that old sun'll go down
Somewhere tonight you'll hear a heart breakin' sound
Maybe this'll be a lonely old town
If there's not enough love to go 'round.
Maybe this'll be a lonely old town
If there's not enough love to go 'round
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee and we don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
Cause we like living right and being free
We don't make a party out of loving but we like holding hands and pitching woo
And we don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
And we still wave Ol' Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
Cowboy boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
And football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
And I'm proud to be an Okie
In Muskogee Oklahoma US
(Lost Her Love) On Our Last Date
It's over ' our love affair 
Too late now I find I care 
Her sweet love never more I'll share 
She's gone ' I'm alone 
I was wrong ' should have known 
Took her home after our last date 
I searched for a simple way 
To tell her what I had to say 
I kissed her then I turned away 
Set her free foolishly 
Destiny misery 
Tragedy on our last date 
Took my ring from her trembling finger 
Brushed a tear from my baby's eye 
Walked away ' didn't know 
That I'd soon miss her so 
Guess I was too young to realize 
So blind I couldn't see 
How much she really meant to me 
And that soon she would always be 
On my mind in my heart 
I was blind from the start 
Lost her love on our last date
I know how long it's been
So, if I can't come in
Then let me just talk to you through the door
I'm a man without a place
Lost, and lookin' for a trace
Of the warm and tender love we had before
I closed every door behind me
Shook my shoes and walked away
Turned my back on you and everything I had yesterday
It's a long, hard road
That leads back from the point of no return
And, I'm just lookin' for one bridge I didn't burn
This river looks so wide
Standing on the lonely side
And, wishing I could be back home again
I'd do anything at all
Just to find a way across
And, to know that you'd forgive the fool I've been
I closed every door behind me
Shook my shoes and walked away
Turned my back on you and everything I had yesterday
It's a long, hard road
That leads back from the point of no return
And, I'm just lookin' for one bridge I didn't burn [unverified]
Mistakes I have made them and you don't know how much I hate them
But that's me and I don't guess I'll ever change
And I don't mean to hurt you heaven knows I hate to hurt you
But here I am to ask forgiveness one more time
(One more time) one more time I'll ask you to forgive me
(One more time) I'll come crawling back to you
All I ask is a chance to show just how much I love you
Won't you please take me back one more time
(One more time) and one more time I'll tell you that I'm sorry
(But this time) I'll get down on bended knee
And I'll cry and beg forgiveness please give me your forgiveness
Won't you please take me back one more time (one more time)
One for the money two for the show you've played your little game so cleverly
First you took my money then you made me go
You showed me up and made a fool of me
Not too long ago I still remember kisses warm and sweet and oh so tender
But like a boat of life that strikes an unconfected tree
That's just how quick you've made a fool of me
One for the money
Everybody told me what you were doing they all said that you would be my ruin
But like the tree that couldn't see the light that's flashin' down
I closed my ears and didn't hear a sound
One for the money
I know you're tired a picking up the pieces of my life
And if the truth was known I'll bet you're tired of being my wife
And I know there's only so much hurt one girl can stand
And still go on believing in her man.
But you're one in a million and you're mine
Heaven knows a girl like you is hard to find
And if I could only find the words I'd say
I love you a thousand million ways.
I know you know that I could never love no one but you
But that don't change the way you feel when I do the things I do
But I get by because you try so hard to understand
And to accept this weakness in your man.
But you're one in a million and you're mine
Heaven knows a girl like you is hard to find
And if I could only find the words I'd say
I love you a thousand million ways
You were mine for just a while
Now you're puttin' on the style.
And you never once looked back
At your home across the tracks.
Your the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground.
Pick me up on your way down.
Hey, pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone.
When their glamor starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong.
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down.
They have changed your attitude,
Made you haughty and so rude.
Your new friends can take the blame
But underneath you're still the same.
When you learn these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground,
Pick me up on your way down.
Hey, pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone.
When their glamor starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong.
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy.
Then they'll take away your crown,
Pick me up on your way down
Where you been where you been it's the same ole question again
What's the use baby what's the use they ain't never gonna turn us loose
You got dirt all over your face and your lipstick is way out of place
Oh we gonna tell 'em what we tell 'em every time before
They won't leave us alone they want us to come home
We been busy makin' merries and pickin' wild mountain berries
We're pickin' wild mountain berries that's our excuse every time
We've been busy makin' merries and pickin' wild mountain berries
[Steel]
Conway I don't know Loretta I don't know if I can keep honey from lettin' it show
What's our plan tell me what's our plan now you know they won't understand
If my hair is a drippin' wet and my clothes are soakin' wet
And we didn't go skinny dippin' in a cement pond
You're my baby you're my man and though your hair is sure gettin' to be a mess
And there ain't no berries in your bucket now we'll explain it honey as best as we can
They won't leave us alone...
Pieces of you all scattered around
Pieces of love that's all over now
What can I do? I'll never be free
With pieces of you all over me
There's a letter in the dresser
And a picture in the hall
There's my mem'ry to remind me
And heartaches you left laying wall to wall
Pieces of you all scattered around
There's nothing really left for me to cling to
But these pieces of a dream that fell apart
And living's slowly killing me without you
Not to mention what it's doing to my heart
What can I do? I'll never be free
With pieces of you all over me
There's an island out in the sea
Just a waitin' for the guys like me
Oh on this island is a crazy school
And there's where I learned the golden rule.
Twenty-one fellas and one little girl
She looks like just an angel with a platinum curle
Ooh, wee oh, me, oh my
I guess that's why they called her platinum high.
I saw her walkin' just a platinum high
Nearly lost my mind when she walked by
Oh I never met a gal looked like this before
That's why I found myself a knockin' on her door.
I said what you're doin' home on a night like this
Come on my pretty baby give your daddy a kiss
Ooh, wee oh, me, oh my
Kiss my baby on a platinum high.
Asked my cutie if she'd like to go
To the house at party or a movie show
She said big daddy I don't care what we'd do
It doesn't matter just as long as I'm with you.
I stepped into her room and I closed the door
Sat on a TV set and I turned the lights down low
Ooh, wee oh, me, oh my
Just me and my baby on a platinum high.
Play, guitar play
Take me back to yesterday
Let me see, cotton growing, in the fields
Let me hear, my momma calling

Look a-yonder ya-all who's coming
Down the road, he's a coming home
But they know I never will
I left them living with that awful thing I done

I didn't tell them I just packed my clothes and run
Play, guitar play
Help me through another day
Help me make another dollar, before I go

We got time, for one more song
Then we'll have to move along
Another town, another crowd
Lord I wonder if they know

Can they read between the lines in my song
As I sing about a good boy that's went wrong
Guitar we got years to kill
We got to climb that distant hill

I wonder if they think of me
Guitar play
I left our hometown for the weekend on a big business deal
And I would close behind you my excuse is sharp and drill
My only business is our pleasure and I don't bother things I won't
Cause we're playing house away from home
We're playing house away from home our names and faces are unknown
Everyone thinks that we're man and wife
We even wear our wedding rings and we don't try to hide this thing
Cause we're playing house away from home
[ steel ]
We'll get up in the morning I'll go my way and I'll go mine
And go home to act like strangers and hope no one can tell
That we have left all the bills from actin' right and doin' wrong
Cause we're playing house away from home
We're playing house...
Yes we're playing house away from home
Forever my darling
My love will be true
Always and forever
I'll love only you.
Just promise me darling
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul, dear
Forever burn.
My heart's at your command, dear
To keep, love and to hold
Making you happy's is my desire dear
Keeping you is my goal.
I'll Forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
Or your loving ways.
(My heart's at your command, dear
To keep, love and to hold.)
Yeah, making you happy is my desire dear
Keeping you is my goal.
I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
Or your loving ways.
Always and forever
I'll love only you
Pop a top again I think I'll have another round
Another one my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down
I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile and did awhile but it felt so out of place
Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops streaming down his face
Pop a top again
All to me is misery and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me is not what I prefer
So it's either here a drinking beer or home rememberin' her
Pop a top again
Paint two eyes, make them cry
Paint two lips, make them lies
And you're painting the portrait of a fool
Paint one heart that's been untrue
Paint one soul make it blue
And your paintin' the portrait of a fool
There are somethings that look so familiar
Strange what this resemblance can be
And now as I look in the mirror
I know, I know the fool you are painting is me
Paint one fool let it talk
Paint two hand that once held it all
And you've painted a portrait of a fool
Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty
Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love. 
Love.
Operator, I'm calling long distance
Please charge it to my room, 702
Hello, baby
No, there's nothing wrong
You know me
When I'm away from you
You see a blue moon hanging
Low outside our window?
And it's hard to sleep with
All of those feelings around
Oh, if I had wings tonight
You could imagine things
I never wanted you more
Than I want you right now
Looking out at the city
It sparkles and it shines
But it holds no fascination
Compared to you
Save me some long nights
And your wildest dreams
And all of your love
And some of that moon
Life may take me down
A winding road
But nothing in this world
Can change my love
Forever you can believe
You'll always be here with me
In the warmest private part of my heart
Right here
In the warmest private part of my heart
Right here
In the warmest private part of my heart
Left a good job in the city a workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost a minute of sleep
While worryin' bout the way things might have been
The big wheels keep on turnin' Proud Mary keeps on burnin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis copped a lot of cane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
The big wheels keep on turnin'...
[ guitar - steel ]
If you come down to the river I bet you gonna find the people who live
You don't have to worry if you have no money people on the river are happy to give
The big wheels keep on turnin'...
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
Pure love, baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch and you in the morning
Pure love, baby it's pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds percent pure love.
I wake up with sunshine, (Sunshine), laying beside me
And Bluebirds singing right outside my window
Soft warm kisses, (Kisses), say good morning, then I get breakfast in bed
You know you make me so happy. (Make me so happy.)
Pure love, baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch and you in the morning,
Pure love, you're the picture of pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds percent pure love.
Pure love, baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch and you in the morning
Pure love, you're the picture of pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds percent pure love.
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds percent pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds percent pure love
Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
"It's all right"

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Release me darlin', let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin
Release me and let me love again
Oh, I have found a new love dear
And I'll always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me, darling, let me go
Please release me, let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin
Release me and let me love again
Please release me, let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin
Release me and let me love again
Maybe you don't know me any more than I know you
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked away
I've been watching you all evening with those teardrops in your eyes
And it touches me much more that I can say
You know I hate to think that someone
Could have hurt someone like you
And if I was him I'd be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Saw you in the corner from the moment I walked in
Saw your lonely face across the room
No I won't forget you and the way it could have been
Why'd you have to leave so soon
You know I hate to think there's someone
You loved instead of me
'Cause at times like this
I'd be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Reuben James in my song you'll live again
And the phrases that I rhyme 
Are just the footsteps out of time
From the time when I knew you, Reuben James.
Reuben James all the folks 
Around Madison Caunty cussed your name
Just a no count sharecroppin' colored man 
Who'd steal anything that he can
And they always laid the blame on, Reuben James.
Reuben James you still walk 
The furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt the wrinkled brow 
The calloused hand upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James.
Flora Gray the gossip of Madison County died with the child
And although your skin was black 
You were the one who didn't turn your back
On a hungry white child with no name, Reuben James.
Reuben James with your mind on my soul 
And Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek 
There's a better world waitin' for the meek
In my mind these words remain from, Reuben James.
Reuben James you still walk 
The furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt the wrinkled brow 
The calloused hand upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James.
Reuben James one cold dark day 
They brought you from the fields
And that lonely pinebox came 
Just a preacher me and the rain
To sing one last refrain for, Reuben James.
Reuben James you still walk 
The furrowed fields of my mind
The faded shirt the wrinkled brow 
The calloused hand upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James
Ribbon of darkness over me since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never cried before ribbon of darkness over me
Clouds're gathering o'er my head it chills the day and hides the sun
And shrouds the night when day is done ribbon of darkness over me

Rain is fallin' on the meadow where once my love and I did lie
Now she's gone from the meadow my love goodbye
Ribbon of darkness over me where once the world was young as spring
Where clouds're bloomin' birds did sing ribbon of darkness over me
[ guitar ]
In this cold room lying don't want to see no one but you
Lord I wish I could be dying to forget you
How I wish your heart could see my mind just takes the breaks of day
Come on back and take away ribbon of darkness over me
Come on back and take away ribbon of darkness over me
A willin' woman, a willin' man
A five room house and a wedding band
Believer, believer
Once it begins, you know it don't take long
Till like two people in a heartbreak song
And wonder, I wonder
Ain't it just like a woman
Yeah, and ain't it just like a man
Chasin' the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
We can't take back those things we said
So, we watch it pass in separate beds
Changing, we're changing
Too little love and too much pride
You won't give in and neither will I
We're like children, children
Ain't it just like a woman
Yeah, and ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
Feet on the floor, holding my head
Sitting alone on the edge of the bed
I been thinking, thinking
Trying to find where we went wrong
Just turned around Lord and you were gone
It's over, ohh, it's over
Ain't it just like a woman
Yeah, and ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
Ain't it just like a woman
Ohh, and ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow, looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
Right in the palm of your hand
Right in the palm of your hand
I can't count the times because of me your heart's been broken
And I have seen you hurt because of angry words I've spoken
But somehow you always knew when I hurt you I never meant to
We keep rising above it all like the sun on wings of morning
And the hurt can't make us fall we keep rising above it all
I have seen the pain that brought your eyes to overflowing
Oh and I've been so ashamed but then you have your way of knowing
Through it all you could still see you and me the way it should be
We keep rising above it all
We keep rising above it all
Wish that I was on ole Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke up on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills
Once I had a girl on ole Rocky Top
Part bear, the other part cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that
Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from ol' Rocky Top
Reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top Tennessee
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms.
Hey, where were you last Saturday night
While I was a layin' in jail
Go around town with another man
You wouldn't even come and go my bail
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms.
Ain't gonna work on the railroad
I sure ain't gonna work on no farm
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms.
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms.
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms.

Sally used to carry my books to school

Hardest working girl in the neighborhood

Selling neck ties to the one's who'd pay
If they couldn't afford it then she'd give them away

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

I was there to buy a pistol. She was there to hock her ring.
The broker in that pawnshop deals in almost anything.
He'll pay you for your misery 
or he'll sell you someone's pain,
And that twinkle in his greedy eyes says your loss will be his gain.
She stood back in the shadows as the broker dealt with me.
Her eyes were dark and desperate from some private misery.
His word was so prophetic when he said, 
You've got a steal.
I said, "Throw in one bullet, and you've got yourself a deal."
A Saturday night special is an easy thing to buy.
All you've got to be is 21, or 15 if you lie.
Just hand the man the money, and if someone's got to die,
The broker in the pawnshop won't even blink an eye.
He handed me the pistol, and I was almost to the door,
When I heard him tell the lady, "Seven dollars, nothing more."
The lady started crying as he took her wedding band.
My hand was in my pocket, and the gun was in my hand.
I had planned to use that bullet on myself, to end my life.
I was once somebody's husband. She was once somebody's wife.
I usually mind my business but I could not walk away,
His dollars just weren't making sense, and I knew I had to stay.
The broker's face turned pasty when he caught my icy stare.
It would never leave my pocket, but he knew the gun was there.
I asked him what his life was worth, and he opened up that drawer.
For a simple golden wedding band, he paid two thousand more.
That Saturday night was special even though it wasn't planned.
As we walked down the sidewalk, she reached and took my hand.
We crossed a bridge, and I took that gun and sailed it through the air.
I said, "Ever been to Texas?" she said, "I think I'd love it there."
A Saturday night special is an easy thing to buy,
All you've got to be is 21, or 15 if you lie.
The broker in that pawnshop used to deal in everything,
But you can't buy a pistol there, you can't hock your wedding ring
The seasons come the seasons go
We get sunshine rain and snow
Just the way that it was planned to be
But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
Cause the flowers will bloom eternaly
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
Darling we could be happy after all
Your leaving will bring
Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories
Got my bag, got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
Long to hear that "All aboard!"
Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven
I'll be waitin' up for heaven
Countin' every mile of railroad track
That takes me back
Never thought my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam?
Gotta take that sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home
Sentimental journey

You've always been good to me and I know how hard you tried
And maybe that should be enough to keep me satisfied
But the lonely in a man needs more than just a friend
And that's where she came in and she loves me
I know you've walked an extra mile you could always find a smile
That could hold me for a while but she loves me
You're a good and faithful woman and I hope someday you'll find
Someone who'll bring out in you the love I've been denied
But as for me it's over I've finally found another
And I'm sorry but I love her and she loves me
I know you've walked
She loves me
Just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
She thinks I still care
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
She thinks I still care
Well if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish
And where could she get such an idea
Just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care
Well she was walking down the street looking fine as she could be, hey hey
She was walking down the street looking fine as she could be, hey hey
If you have love and conversation oh yeah what'd I say, hey hey
She's about a mover she's about a mover she's about a mover she's about a mover
Hey hey hey what'd I say she's about a mover she's about a mover
Well you know I love you baby oh yeah what'd I say, hey hey
Well he strolled right up to me and said hey sweet thing what's your name, hey hey
Well he strolled right up to me and said hey sweet thing what's your name, hey hey
Well you know I love you baby oh yeah what'd I say, hey hey
He's about a mover...
He's about a mover she's about a mover
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of streetlights, even stoplights blink of bright red and green
(Silver bells, silver bells)
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
(It's Christmas time in the city)
Children laughing, people passing meeting smile after smile
(Ring-a-ling, hear them ring)
And above all this bustle you'll hear
(Soon it will be Christmas day)
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Silver bells, silver bells)
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Silver bells, silver bells)
You say somehow she don't fit in with your old drinking crowd
Well bartender it's all new to her she's a lady and should be proud
She loved me so long and asked so little but I always gave her less
Now since she's not with the one she loves she'll love the one she's with
I remember the nights she cried for me and she had every right
While she stayed at home and waited I was out like she is tonight
Now I know how it hurts to be alone and to see her here like this
Now since she's not with the one she loves she'll love the one she's with
Since she's not with the one she loves she loves the one she's with
I came here to say I love her but I'm too late I guess
She went as far as she could go without love then turned the list
Since she's not with the one she loves she'll love the one she's with
Since she's not with the one she loves she'll love the one she's with
The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
'Let my guitar playing friend do my request'
'Let him sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die'
I recall last Sunday morning a choir from 'cross the street
Came to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, 'There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear once before you move along?'
"Sing me back home the song my mama sang
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die
Sing me back home before I die"
Skip a rope, skip a rope
Awwwww listen to the children
While they play
Now, ain't it kinda' funny
What the children say.
Skip a rope.
Daddy hates momma and momma hates dad
Last night, you should've heard the fight they had
It gave little sister another bad dream
She woke us all up with a terrible scream.
Skip a rope, skip a rope,
Awwwww listen to the children
While they play
Now, ain't it kinda' funny
What the children say.
Skip a rope.
Cheat on your taxes, don't be a fool
Now, what was that they said about a Golden Rule?
Well, never mind the rules, just play to win
And hate your neighbor for the shade of their skin.
Skip a rope, skip a rope.
Awww listen to the children
While they play
Now, ain't it kinda' funny
What the children say.
Skip a rope.
Stab 'em in the back,
That's the name of the game
And momma and daddy
Are who's to blame.
Skip a rope, skip a rope.
Awww listen to the children
While they play
It's really not very funny
What the children say.
Skip a rope, skip a rope.
Skip a rope, skip a rope
As the midnight moon was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin', don't say a word, I've already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine, you're tired of fast moves
You've got a slow groove on your mind
You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush baby, believe me I understand
When it comes to love, you want a slow hand
On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
Hey, we're drifting free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, I've already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine, if you want all night
You know it's alright I've got time
You've got a man with a slow hand
You've got a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush, baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love, you want a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time with you baby
Not come and go in a heated rush, baby believe me I understand
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
Slowly you're winning a heart that can be true
For I can't hide my feelings no matter what I do
For slowly I'm falling more in love with you
More and more I need you and want you by my side
More and more I love you as each day passes by
My heart I know you're stealing I hope that you'll be true
For slowly I'm falling more in love with you
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
Well, I was working this joint in Dallas
To make the payment on my car
Just a weekend stand with a local band
They had me playin' rhythm guitar.
Well, I was singin' some old cheatin' song
When this blue-eyed blonde came by
She said, I'm a table over in the corner
Why don't you drop around and say hi
So, I did.
Well, she was dressed like a million dollars
But she was way up outta my class
She whispered into my ear, honey I hear
A honky tonk man moves fast.
All of the sudden my body went numb
I had enough sense to see
That everything I ever wanted in life
Was coming to easy for me.
So I said, "Wait just a minute,
Wait, just a cotton-pickin' minute."
You better not get caught in the desert
Without your snake boots on
You don't lay down on the railroad tracks
'Til after the train is gone.
You don't swim out in deep water
With your pockets full of stone
You don't get caught in the desert, son,
Without your snake boots on.
Well, she was quicker that a boys good judgment
So, we were headed for the parkin' lot
When a guy in the band said, "Wait a minute, man
Lord, are you crazy or what?"
"Well, ole big bad Tex is her lover
And, he's terribly skilled with a knife
He's real particular 'bout who rides his horse
And, nobody fools with his wife."
So, I said, "Wait just a minute,
Wait just a dang minute."
You better not get caught in the desert
Without your snake boots on
You don't lay down on the railroad tracks
'Til after the train is gone.
You don't swim out in deep water
With your pockets full of stone
You don't get caught in the desert, nah,
Without your snake boots on.
You don't get caught in the desert, son,
Without your snake boots on.
Hey, watch out for that snake
He's tempted by the devil to give up the love he knows he's got at home
And temptation sometimes leads the best of men to want to stay out all night long
And the way the world is turnin' you can find anything you wanna see
But I know you turn it down turn around and then come on home to me
But I've got me some kind of woman and she loves me like nobody can
Yes I've got me some kind of a woman and that's why I go on home to be her man
[ guitar ]
He lets me know that I am the only girl in the world he wants to hold
And I can tell by the way he touches me that his love will not grow cold
So why should he go looking for another when I'm all he'll ever need
I'm satisfied to be with him and his love sure does take good care of me
But I've got me some kind of woman...
Someone somewhere's fallin' asleep
In a chair in front of the TV
'Cross town somebody's up
And walkin' the floor at a quarter to three
In some little corner of the world
A forgotten soul, is waitin' by the phone
And right down the hall someone's in there feelin'
Like cryin', 'cause they're livin' all alone
Somebody's needin' somebody, the way I do
Somebody's wantin' somebody, they can hold on to
To be loved by somebody, that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody, somewhere waitin' for me
Late at night, it's lonely and I wonder how I'll ever get through
There's got to be somebody, somewhere who's feelin' it too
Hurtin' inside, goin' through the motions, it's so hard to live
So many feelin' so lonely, when they got so much to give
Somebody's needin' somebody, the way I do
Somebody's wantin' somebody, they can hold on to
To be loved by somebody, that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody, somewhere waitin' for me
To be loved by somebody, that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody, out there waitin' for me
Might be dreamin', might be crazy
Thinkin' you might love me maybe
Poor hearts pounding, overflowin'
Taking bets, I know where it's goin'
Someday you'll love me, it's written in the stars
Someday you need me, to hold you in my arms
Someday you'll want me, just as much as I want you
Someday you'll love me, I will be the one
Someday you need me, just call and I will come
Someday you'll love me just as much as I love you
Just as much as I love you
There's a glimmer in you eye now
What I'm sure of soon you'll find out
Oh, I want you moonlight dancin'
I won't take no for no answer
Someday you'll love me, it's written in the stars
Someday you need me, to hold you in my arms
Someday you'll want me, just as much as I want you
Someday you'll love me, I will be the one
Someday you need me, just call and I will come
Someday you'll love me just as much as I love you
Just as much as I love you
Someday you'll love me, it's written in the stars
Someday you need me, to hold you in my arms
Someday you'll want me, just as much as I want you
Someday you'll love me, I will be the one
Someday you need me, just call and I will come
Someday you'll love me just as much as I love you
Just as much as I love you
I remember when Loretta Lynn said you want to walk me home again
And I said mhm yes I do
And she said well I don't want to go right home
And I'm the kind that don't want to be alone if you would I would too
Ha ha and so we took a stroll and wound down by a swimmin' hole
And she said do what you wonna do I don't care
Mhm I got silly and I found me a frog in the water by a holler log
And I said Loretta this frog's for you
I don't like spiders and snakes and that ain't what it takes
To love me like I want you to
I don't like spiders and snakes and that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you
[Steel]
Well I think of that girl from time to time and I phone up when I got me dime
And I say hello baby ain't you cool
Ha ha she said do you remember when and you like to get together again
If you do hey I see I'm just cool
Ha ha well I am shy and so for awhile most of my lovin' was tough and smile
Till she said come on over here I don't care
Mhm mhm I would never say you might guess
Still lookin' for somethin' but a sneak out of dress
And she said... ha ha ha
Yeah I don't like spiders and snakes...
Splish splash, I was takin' a bath 'long about a Saturday night
A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub, thinkin' everything was all right
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me and I opened the door
And then a splish splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
 
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang dancin' on my livin' room rug (yeah)
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was a even there too
A well a splish splash, I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancing shoes on
 
I was a splishin' and a splashin', I was rollin' and a strollin'
I was a movin' and a groovin', I was a reelin' with the feelin'
 
I was a splishin' and a splashin', I was rollin' and a strollin'
I was a movin' and a groovin', I was a reelin' with the feelin'
 
I was a splishin' and a splashin', I was rollin' and a strollin'
Over the battle fields of all the great wars since the beginning of time
Have walked perhaps the bravest heroes of them all
The men known simply by the soldiers as the Chaplain
And this is the story of but one of the many and many thousands
Who gave his life in the service of his God and his country
There's a star spangled heaven for every soldier boy
Who fights to keep our country clean and free
So soldier trust in Jesus let him fill your heart with joy
He'll stand by you throughout eternity
And although army chaplain who was stopped and bent with years
Was walkin' o'er the battle field his old eyes filled with tears
He was searching for the wounded to try to ease their pain
And for those he knew would never live to rise and fight again
For life for them was over their earthly cares were done
They had gone to meet their Savior their battle had been won
And I couldn't help but notice as he went from place to place
That each soldier boy had died fighting with a smile upon his face
And I saw him kneel beside each one and slowly breathe the prayer
While the tears were streamin' down his face and the wind blew through his hair
And I could hear the big guns boomin' o'er the hill and not too far away
And as I turned to leave him that's when I heard him say
There's a star spangled
Though days and month and even years have slowly drifted by
And all we have are the mem'ries of our boys who have to die
They're living with their Savior beyond the crystal sea
In the Star Spangled Heaven throughout eternity
Many years ago in days of childhood
I used to play till evenin' shadows come
Then windin' down that old familiar pathway
I heard my mother call at set of sun

Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last

Some of the fondest memories of my childhood
Were woven around suppertime
When my mother used to call
From the backsteps of the old homeplace

Come on home now son it's suppertime
Ah but I'd loved to hear that once more
But you know for me time has woven the realization of
The truth that's even more thrillin' and that's when

The call come up from the portals of glory
To come home for it's suppertime when all
God's children shall gather around the table of the Lord
Himself and the greatest suppertime of them all

Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last
There's a table in the corner
Of a honky-tonk in town
And if you should ever want me
There I can be found
There'll be heartache all around me
And the blues for company
At the table in the corner
Where we once used to meet
There'll be two chairs at the table
But something won't be right
'Cause one chair will be empty
Just like my arms tonight
Same old faces all around me
Everything is still the same
But the table in the corner
We'll never share again
Oh, I know that I should leave you
And start my life anew
But that would mean I have to
Forget about you
And it's no use I can't forget you
So I guess I'll spend my time
At the table in the corner
With your sweet love on my mind
I want you to take me home to mama
Introduce me to your friends
I want you to take me home to mama
I'm ready to take a chance on love again
I didn't need a lover
I was happy on my own
I didn't want another
Girls are melted for the phone
But since the day I met you
Oh, my attitude has changed
I think I'm gonna let you
Start turning out the flames
Come on and take me home to mama
Introduce me to your friends
I want you to take me home to mama
I'm ready to take a chance on love again
I really want to meet her
I want to raise a doll like you
And tell her that's she's sweeter
Than any other girl I knew
I tell her not to worry
'Cause her baby is in good hands
I don't mean to hurry
But just as soon as you can
I want you to take me home to mama
Introduce me to your friends
Come on and take me home to mama
I'm ready to take a chance on love again
When you started calling
I was just telling time
Then I started fallin'
And here's what's on my mind
I want you to take me home to mama
Introduce me to your friends
Take me home to your mama
I'm ready to take a chance on love again
I'm ready to take a chance on love again
Yeah, I'm ready to take a chance on love again
You're just a kind of girl everybody wants to meet
You've got a way about you when you walk down the street
That makes me wonder if I'm gonna lose your love someday
And I'm the kinda guy that don't stand in your way

All my life I've been afraid of losing you
Although you never really done me wrong
But there's always the chance you might find someone new
And break the heart that loves you for so long

You're just a kind of girl everybody wants to meet
You've got a way about you when you walk down the street
That makes me wonder if I'm gonna lose your love someday
And I'm the kinda guy that don't stand in your way

You're just the kind of girl that likes to have some fun
And though I'm jealous of you, it's alright
Just as long as I am still the only one
You turn to when it's time to say goodnight

You're just a kind of girl everybody wants to meet
You've got a way about you when you walk down the street
That makes me wonder if I'm gonna lose your love someday
And I'm the kinda guy that don't stand in your way
I know I'm not your first love they're just a past memory
I'm the one who's got you now and that's all that matters to me
I know other arms have held you but I'm not jealous of these
Cause you see mine are the arms that hold you now
And that's all that matters to me
I came alive when you came along yes you brought life back to me
And I don't care what's in your past you're as far as I can see
I know other lips have kissed you and I know you've been thrilled and pleased
Mine are the lips that kiss you now and that's all that matters to me
Yes mine are the arms that hold you now and that's all that matters to me
I woke up crying late at night
When I was very young.
I had dreamed my father
Had passed away and gone.
My world revolved around him
I couldn't lay there anymore.
So I made my way down the mirrored hall
And tapped upon his door.
And I said "Daddy, I'm so afraid
How will I go on with you gone that way?
Don't want to cry anymore
So may I stay with you?"
And he said "That's my job,
That's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you,
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see."
Later we barely got along
This teenage boy and he.
Most of the fights it seems
Were over different dreams,
We each held for me.
He wanted knowledge and learning.
I wanted to fly out west.
Said, "I could make it out there
If I just had the fare.
I got half, will you loan me the rest?"
And I said "Daddy, I'm so afraid,
There's no guarantee in the plans
I've made and if I should fail,
Who will pay my way back home?"
And he said "That's my job
That's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see."
Every person carves his spot
And fills the hole with light.
And I pray someday I might
Light as bright as he.
Woke up early one bright fall day
To spread the tragic news.
After all my travel, I settled down
Within a mile or two.
I make my living with words and rhyme
And all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead
As bits of poetry.
But I say "Daddy, I'm so afraid,
How will I go on with you gone this way?
How can I come up with a song to say
I love you?"
That's my job, That's what I do
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me.
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine
Sometimes in life we ought to think twice
About the people that we step on
Better show our worth while here on earth
For soon the chance is gone
Don't gossip about your neighbor
We gotta show more love
One of these days we're gonna stand
Before that big man above
I gotta help your neighbor show more love
Lend a hand, don't push and shove
One of these days we're gonna stand
Before that big man above
Life is but a vapor
It's here and then it's gone
What we build in heaven
Will be there from now on
But things we gather here on earth
Will soon decay and rust
One of these days we're gonna stand
Before that big man above
Gotta help your neighbor show more love
Lend a hand, don't push and shove
One of these days we're gonna stand
Before that big man above
One of these days we're gonna stand
Before that big man above
I've known you since you were a schoolgirl
Saw the smoke turn to fire in your eyes
From the window of my room
I watched a young girl bloom
Saw the woman in you come alive
Watched you fall in love a time or two
I saw you get hurt once or twice
And you'd come running over, cry on my shoulder
Sometimes I'd get to hold you all night
There in my arms you'd lay soft and warm
You never felt the writing on the wall
You never knew how I wanted you
I was the boy next door, that's all
Just the boy next door, that's all
I watched you drift away out of my reach
I never got to hold you again
And here in my heart is the saddest part
We'll never know how it might have been
There in my arms you'd lay soft and warm
I sure love to catch you when you fall
But you never knew how I wanted you
I was the boy next door, that's all
Just the boy next door, that's all
Do you ever think about me, honey?
The boy next door, that's all
You love the way it makes me feel when I can't catch my breath 
Like walkin' on a high wire, Lord, it scares me half to death 
You're always high above me and I'm always fallin' down 
Our love's just a circus baby, and I'm just the clown 
And I'll do tricks for you, just like you want me to 
I'll do anything it takes just to hang around 
I'll paint a smile for you to cover up my frown 
'Cause our loves a circus and I'm just the clown 
Everyone's in love with you, but they just look at me and laugh 
And I'll bet when they see me cry, they think it's just an act 
Ah, but someday when it's over and we bring the big top down 
You can say it was one big circus and I was just the clown 
And I'll do tricks for you, just like you want me to 
I'll do anything it takes just to hang around 
I'll paint a smile for you to cover up my frown 
'Cause you love the circus, but you don't love the clown
He put his arms around her shoulder
And with a voice that sounded older
He said mom I've got something on my mind
I don't want to bother you
But I sure need to talk to you
If you could only spare the time
And mom I hope you understand
How much I love and need you and
I don't want you to take this the wrong way
But don't you think I'm old enough
And big enough and strong enough to play
The games that daddies play
My friend Billy Parker's dad
Came by today to see me and
He wondered if I'd like to go
With him and Billy on a hike
And maybe camp out overnight
The way I've seen them do in picture shows
And there's one thing I'd like to do
And maybe if I asked him to
He's sit and talk to me man to man
We'd only be gone overnight
And I could find out what it's like to play
The games that daddies play
She quickly turned to hide the tears
From her son of seven years
He didn't know she'd read between the lines
He'd never really known his dad
And although he'd never ask
She knew exactly what was on his mind
She searched her mind in desperation
Six long years of separation
Dimmed the words she knew she had to say
I hope you're never big enough
Or old enough or bold enough to play
The games that daddies play
I know you need and want his love
But son, you're the victim of
Another kind of games that daddies play
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she walks by and the menfolks get engrossed
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she winks an eye and bread slices turn to toast
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she's got a lot of what they call the most
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
The girl can't help It if she was born to please
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
Won't you kindly be aware
The girl can't help it, the girl can't help it!
If she mesmerizes ev'ry mother's son
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she smiles and rare steaks become well done
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she makes grandpa feel like twenty one
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
The Girl can't help it if she was born to please
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
And if I go to her on bended knees
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
Won't you kindly be aware, that I can't help it, I can't help it
Because I'm hopin' obviously
That someday the answer will be 
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me!
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she walks by and the menfolks get engrossed
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she winks an eye and bread slices turn to toast
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she's got a lot of what they call the most
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
The girl can't help It if she was born to please
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
I'm hopin' obviously
That someday the answer will be 
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me!
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
She's never in the spotlights
But everybody knows
That she's the star
And once she shines upon you
She'll make you truly proud
Of where you are
She'll wipe away the pain of all
The dues you had to pay
When the curtain to her world
Starts to unfold
With mother tender hand
She will applaud
And feed the hunger in your soul
And she's known as the Grand Ole Opry
Where the legend come to call
She's the queen of country music
She's the grandest lady of them all
She sings of desperado's
And lonesome whistle love
And midnight train
And the coal mines of Kentucky
And how it feels
To be out in the rain
She sings of Texas cowboys
Of hobos and of heroes
And the loneliness
Up where and prison blues
But most of all she sings about
The common people
Just like me and you
And she's known as the Grand Ole Opry
Where the legend come to call
She's the queen of country music
She's the grandest lady of them all
I just got the goodbye news
Handed me, down by Travis Shoes
Yes, our love was just a lie
Don't want you to see me cry
But those are hurts, the hurt in my heart.
Cause, you always loved me so
Guess a fool's the last to know
Even fools must have their pride
So the pain, I try to hide
But oh the hurt, the hurt in my heart.
Well all, alone with these lies too
Now that I, I have known the feeling of loving you
So I find, try to find a way
To bring you back to me some day.
When I dream of your embrace
There is a smile upon my face
But oh, the hurt, the hurt in my heart.
Oh, oh, this hurt, yes, this hurt in my heart
The Image Of Me
Conway Twitty
Yes I know she's the life of the party
And without her things here would die
Oh but don't be fooled by her laughter
She has her sad times, she knows how to cry
(chorus)
She drinks, and she talks, just a little too loud
And with her pride gone, she hangs around
With any old crowd
Yes I know I'm to blame, and i feel so ashamed
That I made her the image of me
I met her in a little country town
She was simple and old fashioned in some ways
But she loved me 'till I dragged her down
Then she just gave up and drifted away
(chorus)
Today I saw her for the first time since she left me
And she said I've got a favor to ask of ye and I said all right what is it
And she said you know you always told me
If I ever needed any help just to ask you and you'd help me
And I said yeah I remember and she said
Well there's this fellow that I've been going with
And I just found out that he's been slipping around me
And I thought that maybe if you'd write me a letter
And tell me that you miss me and that you still love me
That he may find it and it might greed it
And it might make him jealous and I might not lose it
And I said OK I'll write you the letter
Dear sweetheart just a line to let you know
That I still think about ye and I still love you so
I remember your kisses and every time you held me tight
But most of all I remember the good times that we had each night
Dear sweetheart if you're lonely just let me know
For you're still my one and only and I still love you so
I'm gonna close for now sweetheart and try to go on without you
But don't forget I'll always love you no matter what you do
So now I've written the letter the way you've asked me to
And I hope it makes him jealous the way you want it to
For I've told you I still love you and I want to be with you
But you know sweetheart the saddest part I'm not pretending for I still do
Baby, I bet your ears have been burnin'
'Cause the fence-post gossip wheels have been turnin'
They're sayin' you gave your love and got taken
And once again your heart is breakin'
You're thinkin' lonely is your destiny
You ain't ever been loved by the likes of me
I'd like to be at your beck and call
I'd like to stay around for the long haul
Startin' tonight, I'd like to make sweet memories
Now, you ain't ever been loved by the likes of me
If you need a helpin' hand to start over
Baby, I can give you more than a shoulder
You said you're havin' trouble believin'
That I won't be lovin' and leavin'
I say you've been hurtin' needlessly
It's high time you were loved by the likes of me
I'd like to be at your beck and call
I'd like to stay around for the long haul
Startin' tonight, I'd like to make sweet memories
Now, you ain't ever been loved by the likes of me
I'd like to be at your beck and call
I'd like to stay around for the long haul
Startin' tonight, I'd like to make sweet memories
Now, you ain't ever been loved by the likes of me
You ain't ever been loved by the likes of me
Now, you ain't ever been loved by the likes of me
Time to say goodbye
I know I've said it before
Though I hate to go
I can't be hurt anymore
You'll never see me
With a tear in my eye
The next kiss
Is the last goodbye
When I'm not around
There's someone else you can call
Half a love is worse
Than having nothing at all
I need all your love
And, darling, that's why
The next kiss
Is the last goodbye
No more holding hands
No more whispering words tenderly
Though it breaks my heart
There's no other way for me
Time to say goodbye
There's nothing else I can do
Wish you all the luck
With your somebody new
If I said I'd forget
I'd be telling a lie
The next kiss
Is the last goodbye
Just one more kiss
Then, baby, goodbye
Well, one more kiss
That means goodbye
Aw, baby, one more kiss
Then, baby, goodbye
I saw her walkin' down the street
I tell you all she sure looked neat
Lovely eyes and long black hair
She looked so nervous standing there
Man's she's great
Think I'll ask her for a date
I guess I look just like a clown
Getting up and fallin' down
Hangin' on a parkin' meter
Burnin' like a red hot meter
What a walk
C'mon mouth and talk that talk
You know I couldn't make a sound
My head was goin' round
I was speechless, yeah
My mind was in a whirl
'Cause talkin' to a girl
Is my weakness
I guess I look just like a clown
Getting up and fallin' down
Hangin' on a parkin' meter
Burnin' like a red hot meter
What a walk
C'mon mouth and talk that talk
You know I couldn't make a sound
My head was goin' round
I was speechless, yeah
My mind was in a whirl
'Cause talkin' to a girl
Is my weakness
I guess I musta caught her eye
'Cause instead of walkin' by
She walked right up and with a smile
Said c'mon boy I like your style
Will I date her
So long boy's I'll see you later
I feel tears wellin' up goin' deep inside like my heart's sprung a break
And a stab of loneliness so sharp and painful that I might ever shake
You might think I'm a takin' it hard oh she wrote me off with a call
Don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow I may break right down and bawl
Well the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the running true love scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches and the winner loses all
One day I ventured in love never once suspectin' what the final result would be
I lived in fear of waking up each morning and findin' that you're gone from me
Achin' and pain in my heart for today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her I came out in second place
Well the race is on
Some say love, it is a river
And that it drowns the tender reed
And some say love, it's like a razor
And that it leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed
It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember, in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose
Darling we're not very old
But there's a love story that has to be told
By stars above I swear that it's true
It's the story of my love for you
Of my love for you
It starts when you came in to my life
You vowed someday you'd be my wife
Sweetheart I thought the world of you
You made my world of dreams come true
My world of dreams come true
The years may come and the years may pass
'Til I reach the end of life's journey at last
Though time may change me in someway this is true
It'll never change my love for you
Won't change my love for you
When I'm gone please bury me
On the highest mountain in history 
So all the world can hear me cry
My love for you will never die
My love will never die
There stands the glass that will ease all my pain
It will settle my brain it's my first one today
There stands the glass fill it up to the brim
Till my troubles grow dim then I'll be on my way
I wonder where you are tonight I wonder if you are all right
I wonder if you think of me in my misery
There stands the glass
When was the last time you kissed me
And I don't mean a touch now and then
It's been a long time since you felt like my woman
And even longer since I felt like your man
So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
And if there's someone who wants the love you can give him
Well there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
We've been living a lie for so long now
How much more do you think we can stand
There's an old friend out there and she's waiting
Lord, she's happy just holding my hand
So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
And if he still wants the love you can give him
Well there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
Yeah there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
I've seen you out with your in crowd
Holdin' somebody and laughin' loud
That was me, you know
Whose eyes were burning through you
Someone rings you late at night
But no one says hello at the end of your line
That was me, you know
Breathing warm in your ear
All day, I do fine
Those sweet old memories never cross my mind
Oh, they only come out at night
When you look out your window and it's three o' clock
Some fool's ridin' round and round your block
That's me, you know
Driving myself crazy
And when you hear a rustle or the back door squeak
Turn off the lights and go back to sleep
That's me, you know
Haunted by what used to be
All day, I do fine
Those sweet old memories never cross my mind
Oh, they only come out at night
All day, I do fine
Those sweet old memories never cross my mind
Oh, they only come out at night
Oh, they only come out at night
Oh, the faucet started drippin' in the kitchen
And last night your picture fell down from the wall
Today the boss said, "Sorry I can't use you anymore"
And just then the light bulb went out in the hall
Things have gone to pieces since you left me
Nothing turns out half right, now it seems
There ain't nothing in my pocket but three nickels and a dime
But I'm holding to the pieces of my dream
Things have gone to pieces since you left me
Nothing turns out half right, now it seems
There ain't nothing in my pocket but three nickels and a dime
But I'm holding to the pieces of my dream
Well this road that I walk is a mighty lonely road
And this load that I bear is a mighty heavy load
And this song that I sing is a mighty lonely song
I had a true love but I've done her wrong
(He had a true love but he's done her wrong)
Well this road that I walk it has no end
And on this road I walk I have no friends
The people that I pass are people just like me
Doomed to forever walk this road of misery
(He had a true love but he's done her wrong)
(Now he walks this road of misery alone)
Well this road that I walk is for fools like you
This road that I walk you're gonna walk it too
Each step that you take rules you not very smart
You had a true love but you broke her heart
You had a true love but you done her wrong
Like me you must walk this road of misery alone
You had a true love but you done her wrong
Like me you must walk this road of misery alone
She wore that fallin' out of love look
I even swore upon the good book
Still the last lie I told her
Was the one she couldn't believe
No more crying on her shoulder
She won't even let me hold her
And this time I've hurt her more
Than she loves me
I've been too busy drinking
She's been too busy thinking
'Bout the kind of love she needs
And the man she never sees
But lord she's already stood more
Than I was ever good for
And this time I've hurt her more
Than she loves me
I've been too busy drinking
She's been too busy thinking
'Bout the kind of love she needs
And the man she never sees
But lord she's already stood more
Than I was ever good for
And this time I've hurt her more
Than she loves me
Lord this time I've hurt her more
Than she loves me
Thanks for the times that you've given me,
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!
Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you.
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
I love you !
See her there, see her crying she thinks she loves him so
She don't know how much it hurts me to hear her beg him not to go
If she were mine again I'd never let the tears fill her eyes
She don't know how much it hurts me to see an angel cry
Once she built her world around me and like a fool I tore it down
And she begged me not to leave her just the way she's doing now
Now she's begging to another with that same hurt in her eyes
She don't know how much it hurts me to see an angel cry
I didn't know how much I loved her 'til she turned and walked away
I didn't know how much I'd hurt her 'til I say her here this way
If she were mine I'd hold her forever and dry the tears from her eyes
She don't know how much it hurts me to see my angel cry
She don't know how much it hurts me to see my angel cry
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving
And today I started loving you again
Together, forever and always
No more sleepless nights and lonely days
I promise, I've hurt you for the last time
We'll be together, forever and always
I've cheated and I've lied to you so many times
And I'm sorry more than words can say
But I'll make it, yes, I'll make it up to you in time
We'll be together forever and always
Together, forever and always
No more sleepless nights and lonely days
I promise, I've hurt you for the last time
We'll be together, forever and always
The day I hit this music town looking for a deal
I was green as government ink on a twenty dollar bill
I signed a lot of papers, didn't know what I had to lose
Make no mistake about it, now
You can't be too white to sing the blues

Some folks make it fast down here, some folks make it slow
Learning how the hard way taught me everything I know
When that old highway is your teacher

A country boy can get confused
But one thing I know for certain
You can't be too white to sing the blues

I've learned how to whistle, I've learned how to lose
I've walked a mile in everybody's shoes
Well, you can laugh out loud if you want to
But you can't be too white to sing the blues

Someday when I'm old and rich and I don't work no more
I'm gonna find myself a rockin' chair
And I'm gonna sit on my front porch

And as that old sun is settin' I'm gonna howl at the rising moon
Well, you can go out rockin' now
But you can't be too white to sing the blues

I've learned how to whistle I've learned how to lose
I've walked a mile in everybody's shoes
Well you can laugh out loud if you want to
But you can't be too white to sing the blues

You can't be too white to sing the blues
Today I heard my woman say something I never heard her say before
She just told me that she was gonna to leave me and that she didn't love me anymore
But I know that the loving kindness and the understanding that she had when I first met her
Is still there, somewhere
So I'm gonna get down on my knees and I'm gonna say to my baby
Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
I was the first man to ever
Hold you in a special kind of way
And those unfamiliar feelings that caused you to tremble
I know you remember today
Before you decide that you're gonna leave me 
And do things you've never done before
Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
The two lips that once held sweet surprises 
Surprised me and said goodbye today
And those two lovin' arms that use to reach for me
Just reached out and pushed me away
I know you believe you don't love me
Before you walk out that door
Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
When I walk through that door
Baby be polite
You're gonna make me sore
If you don't greet me right

Don't you ever kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Treat me nice

I know that you've been told
It's not fair to tease
So if you come on cold
I'm really gonna freeze

If you don't want me to be cold as ice
Treat me nice

Make me feel at home
If you really care
Scratch my back and run your pretty
Fingers through my hair

You know I'll be your slave
If you ask me to
But if you don't behave
I'll walk right out on you

If you want my love
Then take my advice
Treat me nice

Make me feel at home
If you really care
Scratch my back and run
Your pretty fingers through my hair

You know I'll be your slave
If you ask me to
But if you don't behave
I'll walk right out on you

If you want my love
Then take my advice
Treat me nice

If you really want my love
Then treat me nice
Trouble in mind I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine in
My back door someday.
Trouble in mind that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living,
I feel like dying sometimes.
I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
Let that two nineteen special
Ease my troubled mind.
Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
My poor heart is beating slow.
Never had so much trouble
In all my life before, oh yeah.
Trouble in mind I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
Cause the sun's gonna shine in
My back door someday.
Trouble in mind that's true
I have almost lost my mind,
But life ain't worth living,
Until I die sometime
Well I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
Twas a little place called Hamburger Dan's
And I heard that jukebox a playing song about a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee for it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox and play the truck drivin' man
The waitress just poured me some coffee
I thanked her and called her again
I said that old song sure does fit me
Cause I'm a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup
I climbed back aboard my old semi and then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a rolling yeah I'm on my way to San Antone
Pour me another cup
And play the truck drivin' man and play the truck drivin' man
Turn your pretty face to mine
Lift your pretty eyes from the ground
I forgive you every way
Oh, turn around, turn around.
Though you left me for a new love
And your new love turn you down
I forgive you every way
Oh, turn around, turn around.
Though I've been hurt
Yes, and I've been blue
But I've never turned
My back on you.
Turn your pretty face to mine
Lift your pretty eyes from the ground
I forgive you every way
Oh, turn around, turn around
Without a warning you broke my heart
You shouldn't've done it and tore it apart
You left me sittin' in the dark a cryin'
Said your love for me was dyin'.
I'm beggin' you baby, baby please
I'm beggin' you baby, down on my knees
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Shine on your love light, let it shine on me
Let it shine, shine, shine, let it shine.
Get a little lonely in the middle of the night
I need you darlin' to make things alright
I'm beggin' you baby baby please
Come on baby baby please
Turn on your light let it shine on me
Turn on your love light let it shine on me

He tells his wife he's going back to work
To finish something he's left undone
And like a fool she believes every word
The door slams and he's on the run
To that other side of town
Where the music's turned up and the lights are turned down
He's a two timin' two stepper
Lookin' for a one-night stand
Slidin' on the dance floor
Slippin' off his wedding band
He'll waltz into the heart
Of every pretty girl he can
Ooh, he's a two timin' two stepper
Lookin' for a one-night stand
Everybody in town knows his name
They know his wife and they know his game
But he continues to play it just the same
'Cause he's a fool and he has no shame
But he always seems to find
Somebody new to believe his lines
He's a two timin' two stepper
Lookin' for a one-night stand
Slidin' on the dance floor
Slippin' off his wedding band
He'll waltz into the heart
Of every pretty girl he can
Ooo, he's a two timin' two stepper
Lookin' for a one-night stand
He'll keep dancin' and foolin' around
Till the walls around him come a-tumblin' down
He's a two timin' two stepper
Lookin' for a one-night stand
Slidin' an the dance floor
Slippin' off his wedding band
And he'll waltz into the heart

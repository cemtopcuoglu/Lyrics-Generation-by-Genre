Little dog who can't get in
Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb
Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim
Pony legs, little trot

The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away
Listen to him barking

A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick
If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste
A taste of what the big dog got

Mama  she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son  your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done
The brightest flame burns quickest
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's owed to mother
But I must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Yeah, still
Rebel, my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness that I'll take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness that I'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Unspoken, and maybe
Yeah, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But, a cold stone's all I see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never I ask of you

They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed  if not it's Satan's fall

Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill  (for the kill)
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it on me

I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry

And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye (goodbye)
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
'Cause I will eat your mind
I'm built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain
You're perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh
I'm a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I've never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else
I wish you'd tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss
Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth
I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat
I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I'm forever in your swirl
You're heartless and I love that
You have no use of me
But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg
You are my Goliath
You are my Goliath
And I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Open and release me
I love you in my head
Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away

Only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud.
So good I can't believe it, screaming with the crowd.
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you.
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you.

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah, let me see you
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
Sound is ripping through your ears 
The deafening sound of metal nears 
Your bodies waiting for his whips 
The taste of leather on your lips 
Hear the cry of war louder than before 
With his sword in hand to control the land 
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord 
Victims falling under chains you hear them crying death pains 
The fists of terrors breaking through now there's nothing you can do 
Hear the cry of war louder than before 
With his sword in hand to control the land 
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord 
The leather armies have prevailed the phantom lord has never failed 
Smoke is lifting from the ground the rising volume metal sound 
Hear the cry of war louder than before 
With his sword in hand to control the land 
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord 
Fall to your knees 
And bow to the phantom lord

If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel

As I pump more blood

Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, "mercy"
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me
Use a knife on me
Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love

Now I see his face, I see his smile
Such a lonely place, no golden mile
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart
His deeds through ages past, tell of his part

See his face, see his smile
Time to die
Yo-ooh, waoh, no

Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns

See his face, see his smile
Time to die
Woah, oh, no

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die

See his face, see his smile
Time to die

Aboard a train
I met a dame
She was a hipster
Man a real gone dame
She wasn't pretty
For New York City

I just couldn't let her go
Get along
Sweet little woman get along

Got off the train at El Paso

Been here before (x6)
Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?
Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'
It comes alive... 
It comes alive...
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive...
It comes alive...
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Been here before (x6)
I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore
Cross my heart, hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room

I hate it all, Why? Why? Why me?
I cannot sleep with a head like this
I want to cry, I want to scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I want to hate it all away
I am a chorus of the voices
That gather up the magnets
Set before me
I attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaning
The coldness of most beauties
Is a challenge that our youth
Must quickly conquer
There is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feeling
I am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundaries
I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of love
But I worship the young
And just formed angel
Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me
I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune
Oh throw it away
For worship someone
Who actively despises you
For worship someone
Who actively despises you
I am the root
I am the progress
I'm the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten stories
Worship
Worship
Pain and evil have their place
Sittin' here beside me
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give
Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
And I'll offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold
That you must give to me
I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up, give it up
Your your life of reason
I want to see you on the floor
And in a coffin, soul shaking
Soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune, like a fortune
Throw it away
For worship of someone
Who actively despises you
Who actively despises you
I am the view
I am the table
I am the view
I am the table
I am all this
I am the root

I am the table
I am the ten stories
I am the table
I am I am I am I am

Motives changing, day to day
The fire increases, masks decay
I look at the river, white foam floats down
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight
The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait
After wakening, silence grows
The screams subside, distortion shows
Mutant thoughts, of bad mouthed news
It's just another birth, of distorted views
The wait

Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.
Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tend to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sands become a crust
And most of you have gone away (hm, yeah gone away)

Come Susy dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where the winds come from
Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the four winds bar (hm, yeah)

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey, hey, yeah! hey, hey
In hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light, that never, never warms
Yes the light, that never, never warms
Never warms, never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Suzy dear
Would find themselves at the four winds bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
The origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Call me Desdenova, eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent

Let us have peace, let us have life
Let us escape the cruel night
Let us have time, let the sun shine
Let us beware the deadly sign

The day is coming
Armageddon's near
Inferno's coming
Can we survive the blitzkrieg?
The blitzkrieg
The blitzkrieg

Save us from fate, save us from hate
Save ourselves before it's too late
Come to our need, hear our plea
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds

The day is dawning
The time is near
Aliens calling
Can we survive the blitzkrieg?

I fucked up one place]
I would cut my legs and tits off
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon
It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh wouldn't it be lovely
Small town girl
Small town girl

I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
I was feeling snappy perhaps I'd been napping
As I just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to eight shift
A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe
Small town girl
Small town girl
Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumed
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nighttime reeling
And some absinthe drunk so late
Small town girl
My small town girl
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight
Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate
Small town giving it a whirl
Brandenburg Gate

Hey hey hey hey, come on!
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, are they right, yes, by who's to say?
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test there their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on (what is it?)
(For whom the bell tolls)
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on (give it to me)

I see you with your portraiture
Does he love you?
Does he love you too?
The brush strokes
Kiss your breasts and toes
I cry icicles in my stein
The heartbeats flutter
With an abnormal rhythm
The pain shoots through my body
A sword between my thighs
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
You're feeling less whore but you stimulate
The hatred smolders in your eyes
I'd drop to my knees in a second
To salivate in your thighs
But all I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
In you and your prickless lover
And his easel in his eyes
I feel the pain creep up my leg
Blood runs from my nose
I puke my guts out at your feet

If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey, iced honey
Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey, iced honey
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey, iced honey
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you
See if the ice will melt for you

Gonna make it today
Gonna get this dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my brow
Make it in a rock and roll show
Oh yeah

Yeah, it's electric
It's electric
Yo! it's electric, yeah
It's electric
Whoa

I stop on red but I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get this dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my brow
Make it in a rock and roll show
Oh

It's electric, yeah
It's electric
Yeah, it's electric, yeah
It's electric
Yeah, it's electric
It's electric
Yo, Whoa, Yeah!
Would you come to me
If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave
Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up
The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips
Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message
Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or oh, state of grace
Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery
The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
I'm running out of my time
I'm running out of breath
And now it's getting so
I can't sleep at night
In the day, feel like death

I'm getting in far too deep
I feel them closing in
I've got to say that I'm scared
I know they'll win
Even so, I'm prepared

Do you believe, what you hear
Can you believe, what you see
Do you believe, what you feel
Can you believe

What is real?
Futureal
What is real?
Futureal

Whenever anyone seems
To treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm the
Only one who feels
That I know what is real

Sometimes it feels like a game
Of deadly hide and seek
And when you're reading this
Then I'll be gone
Maybe then, you will see
Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
Dead men, tell no tales
In Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
In Gangland, where jail birds die
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now your alone but alive for how long?
Dead men, tell no tales
In Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
In Gangland, where jail birds die
A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail
Dead men, tell no tales
In Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
In Gangland, where jail birds die
Dead men
Gangland
Murder
Gangland tell no tales
Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul 
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal 
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight 
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights
To the women and children, the souls of the dead 
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed 
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap 
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek 
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame 
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself 
You can't blame a madman if you go insane 
Give me the strength so I carry on 
[Chorus]
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame 
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself 
You can't blame a madman if you go insane 
Give me the strength so I carry on 
[Chorus]
I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,
Nothing's real until you feel
I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel
I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low, yeah!
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
The words escape me when I try to speak
Tears flow, but why am I crying
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me go?
As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, hallowed be thy name
Yeah, hallowed by thy name
Yeah
Can't understand what is happening to me,
This isn't real, this is only a dream,
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before,
I'm looking down on my body below,
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come,
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe,
'Cause I've no fear of dying,
I'll go when I'm good and ready,
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,
At all of the people standing there in front of me,
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land,
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality,
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side,
To see the truth, the path for you is decided.

Oh oh lots.

My body tingles, I feel so strange,
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well,
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
Believe in me, send no money
I died on the cross and that ain't funny
But my so called friends they're making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke
They choose what they want to hear, they don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
They're saving your souls by taking your money
Flies around shit, bees around honey
Holy smoke holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed'em in feet first this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke yeah
Making holy smoke
Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records burning books
Holy soldiers nazi looks
Crocodile smiles just wait a while
Till the tv queen gets her make-up clean
I've lived in filth I've lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in
Holy smoke holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed'em in feet first this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke yeah
Holy smoke
Smells good
They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When noah built his cadillac it was cool
Two by two they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer 100 years in jail
Holy smoke holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed'em in feet first this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke yeah
Holy smoke
I got the keys to view at number 22
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence, laid
Back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around
[Chorus]
Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I
Got the hooks screwed in
[Chorus]
She's tied up she can't come to the phone
You must have got your wires crossed 'cause she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground
[Chorus]
Right on the money got it wrapped up tight
New ideas for the decor tonight
Gonna make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete set her up on her own
Lyrics by: Burke Shelley, Tony Bourge, Steve Williams

I can't see my feelings
Open my eyes
I can't see my feelings
Open a pair of eyes

I can't see my feelings
Keep them behind
I just keep on reeling
Running back down the line

Oh, I can't stand that screaming
Don't even try
Music fans some feelings
It'll be tell me why

I can't stop that feeling
Showing me why
Man I love that feeling
Yeah, blowin' me right through the sky

Oh hey hey hey hey hey hey
Oh, listen to what she says
If it's good, it's nice
Infinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams

Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
Incase the dream begins again
Someone chasing I cannot move
Standing rigid nightmare's statue
What a dream when will it end
And will I transcend?

Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
Getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep

Even though its reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? well me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?

Help me, help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself even within my dreams

There's got to be
More to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again
My life is so empty, nothing to live for.
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law.
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.
I never had no trouble before this all began.
My life is so empty, nothing to live for.
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law.
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.
I never had no trouble before this all began.
I'm running away, no where to go.
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know, yeah,
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true.
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you, yeah

Longboats have been sighted the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgment day has come around so be prepared don't run stand your ground
They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders, pillaging
Invaders, looting
Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders 
Fighting
Invaders 
Marauding
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away to fight another day
Invaders 
Raping
Invaders 
Plundering
The Vikings are coming
You'd better get ready for we're having a fight
The longboats are coming
It's looking like their? in the dead of the night
Muster the men from all the villages
You'd better get ready to fight with your enemies
Beacons are burning
I'm giving the word to get ready to fight
The battle is nearing
You'd better get ready to fight for your lives
The Norsemen are coming
The Norsemen are coming
The warnings are given
The Norsemen are coming
Raping and pillaging
Robbing and looting the land
Viking raiders from afar
Alright!
Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought
Oh well, wherever, wherever you are,
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are,
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
I can hear them floating on the wind
Immortal souls their weeping saddens me
Mother Earth you know your time is near
Awaken lust the seed is sown and reaped
Through the western isle I hear the dead awaken
Rising slowly to the call of Avalon
The cauldron of the head of Annwyn laced with envy
Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny
All my days I've waited for the sign
The one that brings me closer to the isle of Avalon
I can feel the power flowing through my veins
My heart is beating louder, close to Avalon
I can hear you, can you hear me?
I can feel you, can't you feel me?
Fertility Mother Goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruit of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of Mother Goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest
Throw the dead on the pyre
I hear her crying, the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother Earth holy blood of the dead
Mother Earth I can hear you
Sacrifice, now united
Rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them
Keepers of the Goddess in the underworld
Holding powers of the Mystics, deep inside them
Nineteen maidens, guardians of the other world
Mortal conflict born of Celtic legend
That apart from seven, none returned from Avalon
Mother Earth I can feel you
My rebirth now completed
Fertility mother goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruits of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of Mother Goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest, throw the dead on the pyre
To have the belief of others
Looking for the isle to
Show them a sign
Fertility of all mothers
Stood in silence
Waiting now for their turn
The gateway to Avalon
The island where the souls
Of dead are reborn
Brought here to die and be
Transferred into the earth
And then for rebirth
I hear her crying the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are
The corn of the earth
Mother Earth holy blood
Of the dead
The water in rivers and rhymes
Rises quickly
Are flowing and flooding the land
The sea shall return once again
Just to hide them
Lost souls on the isle of the dead.
From the red sky of the east 
To the sunset in the west 
We have cheated death 
And he has cheated us 
But that was just a dream 
And this is what it means 
We are sleeping
And we'll dream for evermore 
And the fragment remains of our memories 
And the shadows remain with our hands 
Deep gray, came to mourn 
All the colors of the dawn 
Will this journeyman's day be his last? 
[Chorus]
I know what I want 
And I say what I want 
And no one can take it away 
I know what I want 
And I say what I want 
And no one can take it away 
But the memory still remains 
All the past years not so strange 
Our winter times are like a silent shroud 
And the heartbeat of the day 
Drives the mist away 
And winter's not the only dream around 
In your life you may choose desolation 
And the shadows you build with your hands 
If you turn to the light 
That is burning in the night 
Then the journeyman's day has begun 
[Chorus]
In your life you may choose desolation 
And the shadows you build with your hands 
If you turn to the light 
That is burning in the night 
Then the journeyman's day has begun 
[Chorus]
Lights out
We live in a world Of darkness
No doubt
Everything's up for sale
We sleep
All of the world is burning
We pray to god for a better deal
Nothing is sacred
Back then or now
Everything's wasted
Is that all there is?
Can I go now?
Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide
Fight wars
Die in a blaze of glory
Come home
Meat in a plastic sack
Fall down
Better pray to your God for mercy
So kneel and help the blade cut clean
Nothing is sacred
Back then or now
Everyone's wasted
Is that all there is?
Is that it now?
Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide
Judas my guide
Whispers in the night

I live in the black
I have no guiding light

There are no marks upon a man
That can say he's good or bad
No label and no tell tale sign
That can show he's full of lies
By your deeds you will be known
Time will tell truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On judgement day
On judgement day
When you look into their eyes
You don't know what they hide
No label and no tell tale sign
That can show he's full of lies
By your deeds you will be known
Time will tell truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On judgement day
On judgement day
Ignorance is bliss is that the reason
We can not read another's mind
If we knew what thoughts were dancing
Through each others heads
Would we all be driven mad
Would we all be dead
By your deeds you will be known
Time will tell truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all step closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On judgement day
On judgement day
Have you heard on the news?
Another let off madman
Another screw on the loose
Is it the judge or the badman?
What's the matter these days?
No one has the courage to put them away
Nobody has any faith
'Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order
[Chorus:]
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
When I remember back the memories of yesteryear (they really say "yesterday")
With all the friends and all the times
When people were carefree
And walking down the street
When everyone knew everyone
And all the houses' doors were open
No had to care; those days are gone
Those days are gone
[Chorus]
I long for the times when you could
Wander down the street unharmed
When people didn't have much money
But didn't seem to care
It must be the cynic in me
But I don't really like things now
The violence, the attitudes
Aggression that you see everyday
A sick society looks the other way
Remember that song called kill me
From Victim's last LP
Too much for a risc for a golden disc
The price he paid for money
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un Rock & Roll star
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un Rock & Roll star
Sing your song, you can't go wrong
Tempted his business advisor
No need for alarm, you'll come to no harm
He didn't mention the sniper
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un Rock & Roll star
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un Rock & Roll star
The news is read, the need is fed
One yawn ah, two yawn ah
And back to bed
Turn off the light, and hold me tight
C'mon, madman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini, belle vie, bonne nuit
Remember that song called kill me
A lecture on political chicanary
Of peoples rape, recorded on tape
Brought shame to the presidency
Tonight, tonight
One more point for human rights
Tonight, tonight
One more point for human rights
Remeber that song kill me
Once used by a man from Gallilea
He had nothing to lose, he was King of the Jews
Secured his place in history
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un provocateur
The news is read, the poison's spread
One yawn ah, two yawn ah
And back to bed
Turn off the light, and hold me tight
C'mon, maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini, belle vie
Vick played his part, with all his heart
He wasn't prepared for the shock
When hollow lead bit into his head

A new martyr for the book of rock
The book of rock
A new martyr for the book of
You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs

My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me

I can see what a knife's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see

My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs

Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?
Oh yeah, I've done it
Yeah

You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you
I feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near
Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again
And as I wait and I look for an answer
To all the things going round in my head
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again
As the ominous light draws near
There's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here
Only God will know
You're sitting alone you watch
As the wind is blowing treetops
And the swaying rustling leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall
Only God knows
The whole sky glows
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
All my dark dreams 
Drift like smoke in the breeze 
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep 
Here comes the nightmare that never ends 
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men 
In the house of my soul 
In rooms of ugliness and cold 
Memories locked away 
All the doubts and fears I never faced 
Now they come again 
I am falling down to meet with them 
fear within us all 
Mine awake and they stand up tall 
Look for the truth 
Deepest cut of all from you 
Knife of the truth 
Blade of hatred slicing through 
I pray my sleep will break 
Maybe this time I won't wake 
Weakness I hide so well 
This dagger in my mind will tell 
It's my final stand 
I make a fist out of each hand 
To the shadows of the past 
Take a breath and I scream attack
There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you tell to me alone
I can't reach things I can't see
You don't see this strange world
Quite the same as me
Don't deny me what I am
Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth
These are things you can't reveal
These are things you can't reveal
We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man
Infernal sacrifice of hell
Fire breathing lead the way
Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one
Revenge is living in the past
Time to look into a new millennium
Spiral path leads through the maze
Down into the fiery underworld below
Fire breathing lead the way
Lucifer was just an angel led astray
[Chorus x2:]
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
We are not worthy in your black
And blazing eyes
We gather demons in the mirror every day
The bridge of darkness casts a
Shadow on us all
And all our sins to you we give this day
Others wait their turn
Their lives were meant to last
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us
We are cast out by our bloody father's hand
We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world the only one we trust
[Chorus x2]
Alright, the story about a briefcase, a lunch, and a man on the edge
The freeway is jammed and it's backed up for miles
This car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we don't get, you see
A briefcase, a lunch, and a man on the edge
Each step he's closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven? Are they looking down?
Nothing is fair, you look around
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
He's sick of waiting, of lying like this
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a leper because you don't fit
In the land of the free you just live by your wits
Once he built missiles, a nation's defense
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Across the city he leaves in his wake
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down, yeah
The freeway is jammed and it's backed up for miles
This car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get, you see
A briefcase, a lunch, and a man on the edge
Each step he's closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven? Are they looking down?
Nothing is fair, you look around, sing it with me
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down, yeah, yeah
At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo
Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit is forced to yield
There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but doesn't care though
In fact, he doesn't care at all
The general that's commanding
He's defending what he fears
While the troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear
If God is in the heavens
How can this happen here?
In His name, they used the weapons
For the massacre
There is a point below zero
Where the sun can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lay dead in the sand
I stand alone in this desolate space 
In death they are truly alive 
Massacred innocence, evil took place 
The angels were burning inside 
Centuries later I wonder why 
What secret they took to their grave 
Still burning heretics under our skies 
Religion's still burning inside 
[Chorus]
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
As we kill them all so God will know his own 
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne 
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal 
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross 
Templar believers with blood on their hands 
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand 
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty 
To stand with the catharsis, to die and be free 
The book of Old Testament crippled and black 
Satan - his weapon is lust 
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of lies
The perfect ones willingly died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed 
Religion's still burning inside 
[Chorus]
As we kill them all so God will know his own 
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne 
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal 
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross 
Templar believers with blood on their hands 
Joined in the chorus to kill on command 
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty 
Still running herretics under our skies
As we kill them all so God know his own 
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust 
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin 
No passover feast for the cursed within 
Facing the sun as they went to their grave 
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave 
Death is the price for your soul's liberty 
To stand with the catharsis and to die and be free 
[Chorus]
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

I am he the born-less one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild open the seventh seal

I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death

Moonchild hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild open the seventh seal
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild take my hand tonight

The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

One more dies one more lives
One baby cries one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you young man
But I'll see you damned in endless night

Moonchild hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild open the seventh seal
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild take my hand tonight
Mother Russia how are you sleeping
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow
Mother Russia poetry majestic
Tells the time of a great empire
Turning round the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by
Mother Russia
Dance of the czars
Hold up your heads
Be proud of what you are
Now it has come
Freedom at last
Turning the tides of history
And your past
Mother Russia
Dance of the czars
Hold up your heads
Remember who you are
Can you release
The anger the grief
Can you be happy
Now your people are free
I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night.
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain.
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side.
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Run before the killers go free
 
There's some people coming down the street
At last there's someone heard my call
I can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all.
But I must have got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away.
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free.
 
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.
All France is looking for me.
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy.
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home.
 
Well I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of...
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the arms of the law
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free
 
It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
It'd get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before.
Murders in the Rue Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home.

Bleeding you dry from the start 
The sum of my parts
To give it away 
New life in a day 
Some new Frankenstein 
Damned for all time 
Cursed by the angel who fell 
Who saves me from hell? 
And who is my god? 
And where is my soul? 
Too tired to jump too young to run 
[Bridge]
Never ending, forever searching 
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
Always seeking, always asking 
Questions right from the start 
[Chorus:]
Out beyond the new frontier 
Playing god without mercy, without fear 
Create a beast, made a man without a soul 
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man? 
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man? 
I want to end my life now
But I don't know how 
Recycled again a lifetime of pain 
The spawn of a man 
The devil has planned 
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
There's a darkened sky before me 
There's no time to prepare 
Salvage a last horizon 
But no regrets from me 
Maybe I'll be back some other day 
To live again just who can say 
In what shape or form that I might be 
Just another chance for me 
A hurried time no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusion 
And wishing all my life away 
No-one can stop me now 
Time is up it couldn't last 
But there's more things I'd like to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Someday maybe I'll wait till then 
No more lies
They're all sitting at my table 
Talking tall and drinking wine 
Their time is up just like me 
But they just don't know it yet 
So just a word of warning 
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from 
I've got my eye on you 
The clock is fast, the hour is near 
Eventful past is ever clear 
My life is set, the time is here 
I think I'm coming home 
No more lies
A hurried time, no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusions 
And wishing all your life away 
No-one can stop me now 
Time is up it couldn't last 
But there's more things I have to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Don't tell me that this is the end
No more lies
There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you truth
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose
When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end
God give me the answer to my life
God give me the answer to my dreams
God give me the answer to my prayers
God give me the answer to my being
"Woe to you, oh Earth and sea, for the Devil sends the Beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the Beast 
For it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty six"
I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy
Just what I saw
In my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
'Cause in my dreams 
It's always there 
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
Yeah
The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell
Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me
I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course
The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an end game one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us
And look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires...
Hold a halo round the world
Golden is the day
Princes of the Universe,
Your burden is the way
So there is no better time,
Who will be born today
A gypsy child at the day break
A King for a day
[Chorus:]
Out of the Shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again
Dusty dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new your life's adrift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you
Out of the Shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again
[Chorus x3]
A man who casts no shadow has no soul
In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale

Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years

Laying low in a blood filled trench
Kill tim 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die on Paschendale

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Fell the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale
I don't care
They're crazy
Said pass the jam, would you
Awfully kind of you
Now wouldn't it be a little bit nice to sing with this
Gazing at the open door
Just what lays behind
Thinking what I'm looking for
Say what's on my mind
Sinking ever deeper
In the words of guilt of shame
And now I can redeem myself
I just don't care
The words I'm singing they're just right
That's better for my brain
If I try to make much sense
You know I'll go insane
I just don't care
I just don't care
Stay and have some jam with tea
But Brutus wasn't kind
Wasn't strawberries that were red
He wasn't cutting bread
You pass the jam
And so he slammed the tea
? here to me
Was in the conservatory
Yeah, alright
Yes, but still over there
Sinking ever deeper
In the words of guilt and shame
I can redeem myself
I just don't care
Staring at the silver spoon
Take it from your mouth
Take it from the chapter
Turn and face the south
Now face the north
And the east
And the west
And the ?serpent song?
Still burning on in the night
Where's the sun at midnight
Say it's gone
Where's the moon at dawn
It carries on and on
It never ends
To the land of nevermore
Where time began
Where the man still stands
And the ? 'x' ? at the end
Never know that I sang
You'll all know it's the right place
In time, well it is
The words I'm singing
That's just right
They're better for my brain
If I try to make much sense
You know I'll go insane
I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding and hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
standing in the wings there you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the phantom of the opera you're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me you torture me back at your lair
Into the abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night-watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this temple
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.
[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a power slave
I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the power of death.
When I was living this lie-fear was my game
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me
For he is a man and a god-and he will die too.
[Chorus]
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in  my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone
Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave.
[Chorus]
Listen to me Lamia, listen to what I've got to say.
I've got these feelings, and they won't go away.
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees.
Oh help me Lamia or I'm sure I'll die, oh please.
I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong.
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for too long.
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me,
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be.
I'm on my knees, oh help me please.
I'm on my knees, help me please.
Oh Lamia please try to help me.
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh
Oh Lamia please try to help me.
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh
Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing, all there legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling a
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing, all there legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
When it all comes down the line
And the lights they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got your fast bullet
One way ticket outta here
[Chorus]
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
In the cities in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
Breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots
Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins
And the press get fed the scapegoats
Public enema number one
[Chorus]
A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming
[Chorus]
Thinking of an age old dream, places I have never seen,
Fantasies lived times before.
I split my brain, melt through the floor.
Over clouds my mind will fly, forever now I can't think why.
My body tries to leave my soul.
Or is it me, I just don't know.
Memories rising from the past, the future's shadow overcast.
Something's clutching at my head, through the darkness I'll be led.
Oh another time, another place.
Oh another smile on another face.
When you see me floating up beside you,
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
Thinking of an age old dream, places I have never seen,
Fantasies lived times before.
I split my brain, melt through the floor.
Over clouds my mind will fly, forever now I can't think why.
My body tries to leave my soul.
Or is it me, I just don't know.
Memories rising from the past, the future's shadow overcast.
Something's clutching at my head, through the darkness I'll be led.
Oh another time, another place.
Oh another smile on another face.
When you see me walking up beside you,
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam.

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light.

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man.

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.

So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat.

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man.
In the heat of the morning
When your day is still dawning
And your bird, she's singing
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away
Packed your bags in a hurry
Because your mind's in a worry
Mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away
Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vinci-smile
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes
I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe
Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me
'Cause I'm so tired
Yes I'm so tired
So tired
Yes I'm so tired
In the heat of the morning
When your day is still dawning
And your bird, she's singing
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away
When I was wandering in the desert 
And was searching for the truth 
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name 
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again 
I turned my face towards the barren sun 
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground 
They are sealed and are now washed away 
[Chorus:]
You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away 
You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives 
They are sealed and now far away 
[Chorus]
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives 
They are sealed and now far away
It's over your head
And you don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
Trying to run away
You're fighting your friends
You're wearing everybody out
But it never ends
You're wearing me out
[Chorus]
Come on
Reach out
And let somebody in your life
Don't get me wrong
You always apologize
It's just your way
Of making a scene
You need to be loved
It's not such a crime
[Chorus]
Over your head
You just don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
You got so much love
It's burning inside
[Chorus]
Unchain the colors before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of fire.
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.
Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of fire.
"O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
But take away our pride."
(G. K. Chesterton  English Hymnal)
Just a babe in the black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.
The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.
She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in the black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.
The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.
Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring,
It is You
It is You
Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through  the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

"Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."

There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
BUt how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide.

See...onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.

Death and she Life in Death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then, crew one by one
they drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

"One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
(and I heard nor sigh nor groan)
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one."

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

and by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in  falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
spirits go fromhe long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.
The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The thump of diesels hammers down
In the oily sea-the killing ground
His knuckles white his eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil don't care
[Chorus]
Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep
Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when?
The lethal silver fish will fly
The boat will shiver-men will die
A cast of millions-a part to play
Killer victim or fool for a day
Obeying an order-men have to die
Us or them-a well rehearsed lie
[Chorus]
The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to Davy Jones
Every man for himself-you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the cross wire
'stern tubes ready', 'aim and fire
White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Just sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own, hit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free
Spent the night in an L. A. jail, and listened to the sirens wail
They ain't got a thing on me, I'm running wild, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free
Puller here at the Bottle Top, whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me, and that's the way it's gonna be
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before
I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling
And guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law, oh
So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
Well I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha)
I can howl in the rain (ow)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
So give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight
Love me tonight
I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace
I haven't this chance of getting away
Too close to the sun and surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes
I'm taking my life, reliving the past
There's nothing but wait til' my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time, my friends
For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets anekatips
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
One last goodbye
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
If I could survive to live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Do more in my life than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again
For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family and tell them
that one last goodbye
The final frontier (x4)
There isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find
But I have filled my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
That one last goodbye
The final frontier, the final frontier (repeat)
Out in the street somebody's crying,
Out in the night the fires burn,
Maybe tonight somebody's crying,
Reached the point of no return.
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe,
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave.
Like the eagle and the dove,
Fly so high on wings above,
When all you see can only bring you sadness,
Like a river we will flow,
On towards the sea we go,
When all you do can only bring you sadness,
Out on the sea of madness.
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling,
Out in the dark there burns a dream,
You got to hope when you are falling,
To find the world that you have seen.
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe,
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave.
Like the eagle and the dove,
Fly so high on wings above,
When all you see can only bring you sadness,
Like a river we will flow,
On towards the sea we go,
When all you do can only bring you sadness,
Out on the sea of madness.
It's madness,
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness,
There ain't no wind to fill your sails,
Madness,
When all you see can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go
Here they stand brothers them all
All the sons divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
Oh oh oh oh
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds
Oh oh oh oh
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Then they watch the progress he makes
The good and the evil which path will he take
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers before it's too late
Oh oh oh oh
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done
Start, with the sun 
And move on out
The future's in the skies above
The heavens unfold
And a new star is born
Space and time makin' love
[Chorus]
Oh what a time we had
Living on the ground
I've moved to station No. 5
See you next time around,
Next time around
As far you want, as close as you need
It's all in the mind, you know
This old world hasn't really seen it's day
It's here, time to go
[Chorus]
Remember when it was so clear
We were young, but the memory still remains
To pick fruit from a tree
Fish from the seas
Now nothing's left here, but the stains
Well I can't cry no more
Can only be glad
There's other places we can be
If the time suits you right
I'm leaving tonight
Come fly away with me
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Oh yeah
Start, with the sun 
And move on out
The future's in the skies above
The heavens unfold
A new star is born
Space and time makin' love
[Chorus]
Another time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
That will be black over a night
One way ticket now returned
My shootin' stars are vastly burnt
On the edge that we can't see
Let's shot the moon, you and me
And that particular you'll see
A just too lonesome galaxy

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We're slippin' through the night

I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shootin' plasma from my grave
Event horizon lost in space
Runnin' in a human race
I don't know where I don't know why
But somehow back in time again
I'm on the edge you can't see
Another take your love at night
A single party call on me
You won't be trackin' me by sight

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We're slippin' through the night

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Take my eyes, the things I've seen
In this world coming to an end.
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin.
You may pass through me and
Leave no trace, I have
No mortal face.
Solar winds are whispering,
You may hear me call.
We can shed our skins and swim
Into the darkened void beyond.
We will dance among the world
That orbit stars that aren't our sun.
All the oxygen that trapped us in
A carbon spider's web.
Solar winds are whispering, you
May hear the sirens of the dead.
Let the elders to their parley
Meant to satisfy our lust.
Leaving Damacles still hanging
Over all their promised trust.
Walk away from freedoms offered
By the jailors in their cage.
Step into the light, startripping
Over mortals in their rage.
Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are the light that brings
The end of night.
Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are with the Goddess
Of the sun tonight.
The preacher loses face
With Christ.
Religion's cruel device is gone.
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone.
The crucible of pain will forge the
Blanks of sin, begin again.
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose.
Virgins in the teeth of God are
Meat and drink to feed the damned.
You may pass through me and I
Will feel the life that you live less.
Step into my light, startripping,
We will rage against the night.
Walk away from comfort offered
By your citizens of death.
Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are the light that brings
The end of night.
Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are with the Goddess
Of the sun tonight.
Take my eyes for what I've seen.
I will give my sight to you.
You are free to choose whatever:
Life to live or life to lose.
Whatever God you know,
He knows you better than you
Believe.
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived.
Look into our face reflected in the
Moonglow in your eyes.
Remember you can choose
To look but not to see and
Waste your hours.
You believe you have the time
But I tell you your time is short.
I see your past and future, all the
Same, and it cannot be bought.
Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are the light that brings
The end of night.
Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are with the Goddess
Of the sun tonight.
Take my eyes for what I've seen.
I will give my sight to you.
You are free to choose whatever:
Life to live or life to lose.
Whatever God you know,
He knows you better than you
Believe.
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived.
The preacher loses face
With Christ.
Religion's cruel device is gone.
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone.
The crucible of pain will forge the
Blanks of sin, begin again.
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose.
Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me

Oh, I've never felt so strange
But, I'm not going insane

I've no doubt that you think I'm off my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do

Oh, they drain my strength away
Oh, they're asking me to stay

Nightmares, spirits calling me
Nightmares, they won't leave me be

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool

Now, I feel they are so near
I, begin to see them clear

Nightmares, coming all the time
Nightmares, Will give me peace of mind

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too

Oh, we'll drown together
It, will be forever

Nightmares, forever calling me
Nightmares, Now we rest in peace
The only place where you can dream, living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky, nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place
Oh
Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds, living here, you'll never grow old
Oh baby
Don't you hear me call? Ooh
You killed your first man at 13,
Killer instinct, Animal supreme,
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on.

Through earth and water, fire and wind,
you came at last-nothing was the end,
Make a cut by fire and stones,
Take you and your blade and break you both
in two-break you both in two.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel-and it's rolling still.
Trace your way back 50 years
To the Glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah!
Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the blood thirst
No radar lock on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home
[Chorus: x2]
Climb into the sky never wonder why, tail gunner
You're a Tail gunner
Nail that Fokker kill that son,
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun,
The weather forecasts good for War
Cologne and Frankfurt? have some more!
Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tail gunner's gone
No more Bombers (just one big bomb)
[Chorus]
Trace your way back 50 years
To the glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah|
Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the blood thirst
No radar lock on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home
[Chorus: x2]
Climb into the sky never wonder why, tailgunner
You're a tailgunner
Nail that fucker kill that son.
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more|
Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunner's gone
No more bombers (just one big bomb)
[Chorus]
The words she said turned out why
Desperation fills her eyes
Hold her in your arms
Don't let go
When you taste defeat, when you loose again
Fight and win, never give in
Hold her in your arms
Don't let go
That girl you need
Gonna knock you off your feet
That girl, you know
She'll never let you go
[Chorus]
That girl, That girl, That girl you need
That girl, That girl, That girl, That girl
Can you hear her call, call out your name
Think about you, cry without you
Hold her in your arm
Don't let go
Can you taste defeat, when you loose again
Fight and win, never give in
Hold her in your arms
Don't let go
That girl you need
Gonna knock you off your feet
That girl, you know
She'll never let you go
[Chorus]
[Chorus: x2]
You need!
Silently to silence fall 
In the fields of futile war 
Toys of death are spitting lead 
Where boys that were our soldiers bled 
war horse and war machine 
Curse the name of liberty 
Marching on as if they should 
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood 
In the mud and rain 
What are we fighting for 
Is it worth the pain is it worth dying for 
Who will take the blame 
Why did they make a war 
Questions that come again 
Should we be fighting at all 
Once a ploughman hitched his team 
Here he sowed his little dream 
Now bodies arms and legs are strewn 
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom 
Each moment's like a year 
I've nothing left inside for tears 
Comrades dead or dying lie 
I'm left alone asking why 
After the war 
Left feeling no one has won 
After the war 
What does a soldier become
Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky
Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes
I have dealt in mysteries and trickery of light to entertain
Looked into the abyss, called it by its name

I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it
I'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it
A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
Know the secrets, you shall not deride us

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this is my house
I am the master of the tides, I shame the mirror in my sight
What random music of the spheres across the years

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
I curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned
Know you speak with demons, you cannot command

Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded
Burning by the Mortlake shore, my house, my books inside it
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her
Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this was my house
I was the keeper of the books, I had the knowledge of the scrolls
But now through ignorance and fear, I cast a shadow through the years

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Restore the knowledge memory
Strange alchemy
Roll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again
Do you feel lucky
Or do you feel scared
Take what luck brings
And be Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
What will the next day bring
Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter
So why don't you answer
So why did you send
An angel to mend
Best make decisions
Before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reins
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again
Nothing to lose
But so much to gain
A little danger
It goes without saying
But what do you care
You're gonna go in the end
Gate open to heaven
Is ready and waytnig
Or straight down to hell
Can go there as well
I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
Sowhy don't you go
Just leave well alone
Don't you think I'm a savior
Don't you think I could save you
Don't you think I could save your life
There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again
You have been warned
But still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn
The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take
Decisions to make
Arrive at the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait
It may be too late
Now I'm here can you see me
'cause I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold tell me
You can feel me
Cause I'm here

Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my
Dreams before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'cause you can count your
Real true friends on one hand

Through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would
Die for you
Thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say

In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one
Right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're
On the outside
Looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to
It's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does

Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what
Happens when we die
Wouldn't it?
There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must
Have lived before
Don't you?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an
Open and shut case

Extrasensory Perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through
Space and time?

You know I feel so elated
'cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your "friends"
Might say
We'll meet up again someplace
Some way
One day
Now the contracts out
They've put the word about
I'm coming after you
It's not the money I make
It's the thrill of the chase
And I'm coming after you
I watch your every move
Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways
I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think
[Chorus: x2]
Better watch out, cause I'm the assassin,
Better watch out, better watch out
I'm in a cold cold sweat
I taste the smell of death
I know the moment's getting closer
And as you walk to the light
I feel my hands go tight
Excitement running through my veins
I've got you in my sights
I've got you dead to rights
The triggers waiting for my finger
I feel adrenalin rush
It's just the final touch
You can kiss your ass goodbye
[Chorus]
Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls
Is this a dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see
Before my eyes

I wonder why I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger
Every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
And reborn again?
He threw down a glove you made the mistake
Of picking it up now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance.
CHORUS
OH...OH...Fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
OH...OH...Fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for your life!
Ready to start the duel begins the best man wins in the end.
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow.
CHORUS
The fighting resumes, a silence looms the swordsmen move 'gainst each
 other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow, a stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile the Reaper looks on.
CHORUS
OH...OH...Fought the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought for the pleasure
OH...OH...Fought for the honour
fought for the splendour
Fought to the death
I've looked into the heart of darkness 
Where the blood red journey ends 
When you've faced the heart of darkness 
Even your soul begins to bend 
For a week I have been waiting 
Still I am only in Saigon 
The walls move in a little closer 
I feel the jungle call me on 
Every minute I get weaker 
While in the jungle they grow strong 
What I wanted was a mission 
And for my sins they gave me one 
They brought it up just like room service 
Cause everyone gets what they want 
And when that mission was all over 
I'd never want another one 
I know, captain that you've done this work before 
We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure 
The colonel's gone rogue 
and his methods are unsound 
You'll take a PBR up river track him down 
There's a conflict in every human heart 
And the temptation is to take it all too far 
In this war things get so confused 
But there are some things which can not be excused 
He's acting like a god an insane lunatic 
Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice 
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow 
Here is the file and it's all you need to know 
Here I am the knife in my hand 
And now I understand why the genius must die 
Now I stand alone in darkness 
With his blood upon my hands 
Where sat the warrior the poet 
Now lie the fragments of a man
Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
But I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Balancing on a ledge, living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, someday I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on, yeah
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil, the evil that men do
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do
Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know that I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of my world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face all this on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I make no sound
Waiting for the mist to cover all around
I carefully picked my time
Then took the wall
I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about then off again
Being at the wrong place
And the wrong time
Suspected of a hit that was my crime
I am a fugitive being hunted down
Like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear
My name
Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack
Ever moving onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun
I am a fugitive being hunted down
Like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear
My name
Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never
Be the same
But if I ever prove
My innocence some day
I've got to get them all to make them pay
I am a fugitive being hunted down
Like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear
My name
Tell you a thing that you ought to know
Two minutes of your time, then on you go
Tell tale of the men all dressed in black
That most of them, not coming back
Sent off to war to play little games
And on their return, can't name no names
Some strange yellow gas has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes, removed all the lies
And strange as it sounds, death knows no bounds
How many get well?
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table?
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing
To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools?
And to think that we thought you the answer
I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed, I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense, I can see it clearly now
Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesize
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept
Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the facade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome
You had us all strung out with promises of peace
But all along, your cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now?
Only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to Hell as well
Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance, at least
Take the world to better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy you now will leave
We seemed destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life, while there's hope
That man won't self-destruct
Why can't we treat our fellow men
With more respect and a shake of their hands?
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is becoming a way of life
We live in an uncertain world
Fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones
But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know
"Fight fire with fire, life is cheap"
But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care?
They benefit from death and pain and despair
Tough of the track,
With the wind,
And the rain that's beating down on your back.
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound
Is ringing in your head,
With every step you tread,
And every breath you take,
Determination makes
You run,
Never stop,
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop,
Keep the pace,
Hold the race,
Your mind is getting clearer,
You're over halfway there but the miles
Just never seem to end
As if you're in a dream,
Not getting anywhere.
It seems so futile.
Run, on and on,
Run, on and on,
The loneliness of the long distance runner.
I've got to keep running the course,
I've got to keep running and win at all costs,
I've got to keep going, be strong,
Must be so determined and push myself on.
Run over stiles, across fields,
Turn to look at who's on your heels,
Way ahead of the field,
The line is getting nearer but do
You want the glory that goes,
You reach the final stretch,
Ideals are just a trace,
You feel like throwing the race,
It's all so futile.
Run, on and on,
Run, on and on,
The loneliness of the long distance runner.
As he travels on the
Beast of burden,
Moving up along the mountainside,
As he gazes looking down the
Valley,
No regrets but his pride.

As he journeys across
Mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him.
His reflection of the beauty
Round him.
Feeling empty inside.

He is running from his
Wildest thoughts.
He is running from his everything.
He is looking now to
Find something,
Hoping he could be saved.

He's searching for the answer now.
It's something that he's managed to
Avoid up 'til now.
Real conviction, that he craves.
He needs to find the answer
Sooner than later.

Pushed himself to the limits.
He had to strive for all the harder
Things in life,
But what the cost of giving now?
His life and his time are the only things
That he has.

Life is is not a rehearsal.
All he has is the one chance
To get it right.
Leaving really is the only
Way to know.

Maybe one day they'll forgive him
What he's done,
But now the pain of lying too
Early in the grave.

Destiny, no good to hide away.
Penance now will be his only way.
Understand, no good to run away.
Penance now will be his saving
Grace.

He tries to make his peace
With God.
All is forgivable but it's left
A little late.
Trying something that he's not.
Is it possible to change such a lot?

He's taken someone's life away.
There's not a day goes by.
He regrets what he's done.
He should have found another way
But the good book says:
An eye for an eye.

In reflecting on decisions
That were made.
On the judgments that will
Haunt him 'til his grave.
No one has the right to
Take another life
But in his mind he had no choice.
So be it.

Destiny, no good to hide away.
Penance now will be his only way.
Understand, no good to run away.
Penance now will be his saving
Grace.

Destiny, no good to hide away.
Penance now will be his only way.
Understand, no good to run away.
Penance now will be his saving
Grace.

Far, far away, the man
Who would be king.
Far, far away, the man
Who would be king.
So far away, the man
Who would be king.
So far away, the man
Who would be king.
Far, far away, the man
Who would be king.
Pay to kill, die to lose, hunted, hunter which are you
Diablo come again to make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull, one by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate, know which breath will be your last
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Human heart, human mind, intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night, watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe throw the line, everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will iron fist, how could it have come to this?
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay live
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what you future will behold
You're a legend you own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius
"Woe to you, oh Earth and sea, for the Devil sends the Beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the Beast 
For it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty six"
I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy
Just what I saw
In my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
'Cause in my dreams 
It's always there 
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
Yeah
The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell
Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released4
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me
I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course
The keys to death and hell
The ailing kingdom doomed to fail
The bonds of sin and heart will break
The pilgrims course will take

Quelling the devils might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Holy battles take their toll

Liberty and hope divine
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell

Spirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

To courage find and gracious will
Deliver good from ill
Clean the water clean our guilt
With us do what you will

Then will my judge appear
Bear no false angel that I hear
For only then I will confess
To my eternal hell

Now give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell

Spirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

Now give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell

Spirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begun
We want information, information, information
Who are you?
The new number two
Who is number one?
You are number six
I am not a number, I am a free man!
I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feet
Goin' all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going out
If you kill me, it's self defense
if I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name
Run, fight to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
When I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life, will I ever see my countrymen again?

As the captain calls us on the deck, I take my things and walk
To the harbor side I glance back one last time
Fleeing our nation, our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide

We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles and more free from thee
Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
We flee from what is not, what is will be

We flee the earth and face our harsh reality
Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?
We run from the evil tongues, rash judgments, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again

As we sail into ocean size and lose sight of land
A face of contentment around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams

Riding the waves and the storm is upon us
The winds lash the sails but the ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come

No, there's no one going back, no, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side, we pray to God that we won't die

As we ride the rough seas, as we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives and pray that I survive
Four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews, their phantoms follow us

Spirits, sails, they drive us on through the all consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
We just can't get away from the eye of the storm
The birds out soar the raging storm but we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth that we now crave is many leagues from safe

Holding on for our dear lives and we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed? The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigued, trembling with cold, blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold, heaven's rain upon us falls
Twenty days without a meal and ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms, the scurvy rest did slaughter

Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman

We approach the other side of the ocean with the tide
In our favor just for once, welcome greeting, our new land
The elation in our hearts, the excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away, I have no life left in me
No more strength and nothing left to give, must find the will to live
Never thought that we could make it, truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from, never wanted it to end this way

Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman
Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman
When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost
At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever
The thin line between love and hate
The thin line between love and hate
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds as the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As you plunge into a certain death
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And as the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 
We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
When you start to take a look within 
Do you feel at ease with what you see 
Do you think you can have peace of mind 
And have self-belief or be satisfied 
Do you think you even like yourself 
Or really think you could be someone else 
Is there something that you'd rather be 
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see 
All my life I've run away 
All my life I've tried to hide away 
Fell the paranoia creeping in 
Like a cancer eating at the skin 
Do you feel you've lost your self esteem 
And your self respect, what can you expect 
All my life, I've run astray 
Let my faith, slip away 
All my life, I've run astray 
Allowed my faith, to drift away 
Are you scared to look inside your mind 
Are you worried just at what you'll find 
Do you really want to face the truth 
Does it matter now, what have you got to loose 
Try to release the anger from within 
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins 
Do you really care what people think 
Are you strong enough to release the guilt
Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
It's the same in every country
When you say you're leaving
Left behind the loved ones
Waiting silent in the hall
Where you're going lies adventure
Others only dream of
Red and green light this is real
And so you go to war
For the passion, for the glory
For the memories for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference, all the same
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colors don't run, from cold bloody war
There is no one that will save you
Going down in flames
No surrender certain death you
Look it in the eye
On the shores tyranny you
Crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom with your
Lonely unmarked graves
For the passion, for the glory
For the memories for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference, all the same
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colors don't run, from cold bloody war
He is the king of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow

He rules the sand worms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
On the land called planet Dune

Body water is your life
And without it you would die
On the desert the planet Dune

Without a still suit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the "mice"
That they call the "Muad'Dib"

He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar

He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars

The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe yes
They'll be cut down
You'll see he'll be the
Best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men
And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
And he'll make a stand
Against evil and fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end
Cold as steel the darkness waits
It's hour will come
A cry of fear for the chosen worshipping the sun
Mother natures black revenge on those who waste her life
War babies in the garden of Eden 
Shall turn our ashes to ice
Sunrise is gone, freezing up the fires
Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires
Sunrise is gone
Sunrise is gone
Around the world the people stop with terror-stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas
There's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
Sunrise is gone, freezing up the fires
Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires
Around the world the nations wait
For some wise words from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
Is this the end the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm
Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not the journeys end, it's just begun
[Instrumental]
She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call.
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all,
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form.
It's been three long years since I've been gone.
I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry.
I'll never know the reason why I had to go.
Oh, oh, I'm crying,
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?
I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side.
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died.
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone,
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone.
Oh, oh, I'm crying,
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?
There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies
And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
Without a conscience they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds
They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
The rats in the cellar you know who you are
Or do you?
Watching beginnings of social decay
From the coast of gold, across the seven seas,
I'm traveling on, far and wide,
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself,
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone else.

I close my eyes, and think of home,
Another city goes by, in the night,
Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it til it's gone away,
And my heart is lying there and will be til my dying day.

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,
Face up, make your stand,
And realize you're living in the golden years.

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind,
Can't ease this pain, so easily,
When you can't find the words to say, it's hard to make it through another day,
And it makes me want to cry, and throw my hands up to the sky.

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,
Face up, make your stand,
And realize you're living in the golden years.
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me, occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
Pariah from society
Addicted to sobriety
A product of a virgin birth
Another god on earth
Yes that's your fantasy

You say that you can read my mind
Be careful of what you might find
You think that you can be like me
And see what my eyes see
But you're no friend of mine

Do you believe every word I say?
Make your own truth, and get out of my way

I'm your pariah
For you desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah

An angel or the Antichrist
A symbol of your own device
Pathetic in your own sad way
You're just one pill away
From taking my advice

Do you believe every word I say?
Make your own mind, and get out of my way

I'm your pariah
For you desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah

Do you believe that I'm from Heaven?
That I descended from the sky?
The graven image of a pseudo icon
To worship me on high?

I'm not your savior
I got no wings to fly
Just your pariah
Don't look to me when your life is over

I'm your pariah
For you desire
Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah

Ain't no messiah
Just your pariah
I wish somebody would empty my head
I am so sorry for the things that I've said
This hopeless feeling that's living inside
I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find
Some peace of mind

I ain't no hero who's gonna save you
I just say "hi" as I'm passing right through
I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride
So please forgive me while I'm trying to find
Some peace of mind

Read in between the lines
Truth that is neither black nor white
Black nor white
Just give me something real
Broken man still searching for the light
In the night

Caught In the middle as the front line falls
It looks like I don't stand a chance
If only I could turn my life around
Or is this just the circumstance
We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night
The earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always
While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down from night
And so we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god mars
As we travel the universe
The midnight hour approaches

The only time he's feeling good is when he'd killed and killed again
When he's killed again

Well I'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout the world and it's hang ups
Gonna get myself together, take a ride downtown
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away

He makes me happy when I'm feeling down

Gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away
Oh, right away...
They say you came from heaven but I know that's not the truth,
'Cause I don't think an angel could look anything like you,
Your eyes are made from sapphires and your heart is made from stone,
You gotta be the closest thing to hate I've ever known,
And if I didn't know better I'd say you had come alone to the party.
Oh yeah.
The light is always shining, but you swear that it's gone black,
The tide is always turning, but you're never looking back,
If I didn't know better I'd say times were pretty bad,
Because Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die.
The gifts you bring are fire, and your dreams they turned to dust,
Your flying days are over, and your wings have turned to rust.
If I didn't know better, I'd say all you had is lost,
Because Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die.
If you swallow just a little pride, you might find a little love inside,
Open up and let somebody in, 'cause if you need somebody,
You know it's not a sin.
Rusty Angels they can't fly, Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly, no, Rusty Angels gonna die,
Gonna die, yeah, you can't fly, oh no,
Gonna die, oh yeah, you can't fly, oh no.
You've seen life through distorted eyes
You know you had to learn
The execution of your mind
You really had to turn
The race is run the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies
The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
And now there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom
Could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again
The light of day
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies
You bastards
Where can you run to
What more can you do
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion
Nothing more to tell, yeah
Everything around you
What's it coming to
God knows as your dog knows
Bog blast all of you
Sabbath bloody Sabbath
Nothing more to do
Living just for dying
Dying just for you, yeah
I feel so good, I feel so fine
I love that little lady, she's always on my mind
Gives me lovin' every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never goin' away
Someone to love me
You know she makes me feel alright
Someone who needs me
Love me every single night
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman 'til the end of time
Someone to live for
Love me 'til the end of time
Makes me feel happy
Good to know that she's all mine
Lovely lady make love all night long

I'm never gonna leave ya anymore, I said no more
I said no more, uh alright now yeah
No more yeah, I said no more, no more
I said no more, no more
I said no more, uh yeah
Man of madness who lives in my head
Keeping me awake at night he sits on my bed
He drives me crazy, he won't go away
Playing his game every night and everyday, yeah-ah
My mind feels heavy, my body feels weak
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep
Impending doom is what I'm about
Think I'm going mad without a shadow of doubt
I sense a serenity yeah
Is it really out there?
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control
I'm paying the price now for... Selling My Soul
Selling My Soul
I sense a serenity yeah
Is it really out there?
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control
I'm paying the price now for... Selling My Soul
Selling My Soul
Yeah-ah
For Selling My Soul
Yeah-ah
Selling My Soul
Yeah-ah
For Selling My Soul
There's a vision in the sands
Rising from the ancient past
Crying let my spirit go
Lead my burning soul to rest
Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
There's no shelter from the heat
There's no mercy from this land
Hear a thousand chanting souls
Waiting judgment from god's hand
Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star
The pyramids will fall
Turn to dust before the sun
And the star will rise again
Until destiny is done
Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star
Oh, it's night again
And the dark just killed the sun
If the light must end
You've got time to run away
There's a door to dreams
And it always lets you in
But with a silent scream
All the nightmares must begin
Still you chase what you can't see
Like death and pain and sin
And the shadow of the wind
The shadow of the wind
You'll remember me
I could make you disappear
Be where you want to be
Just as long as it's not here
Well, I'm back and stronger
And the first one's always free
And it lasts much longer
You can bet your sanity
'Never more', the victim cries
As I slip beneath the skin
Like the shadow of the wind
The shadow of the wind
If words had names like red and green
And two for sympathy
Black and white and in between
Then you'd be misery
Every day is an inquisition
Who are you? What are you? Why?
I'm alive, I belong, I'll be back
It's a half truth, still a whole lie
In the garden of good and evil
You'll know but you know
The spider only spins
The shadow of the wind
The shadow of the wind
I've been gone a long long time, waiting for you 
I didn't want to see you go, oh, no, no 
And now it's hurting so much, what can I do? 
I wanted you to be my wife 
The days are passing slowly, since you've gone 
Your memories are all I have, yes I have 
I sit here waiting but you'll never show 
Without you I can't carry on, oh my baby 
You said you'd always love me, all of my life 
And then you said your last goodbye, yeah, goodbye 
Why the sudden change, why all the lies? 
I should have seen it in your eyes 
The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you 
My summer love has turned to rain, all the pain 
The silent emptiness of one sided love 
My life means nothing now you're gone, ooh my baby
There's no reason for you to run
You can't escape the fate of the chosen one
Black moon rising, in a blood red sky
This time you realise that you're gonna die
Drinking your blood brew is your answer
That's what you plan to do
No dreaming, time you cheat this master
You're on your own going through
Wind of mist has taken over your mind
And you think you're on your own
Don't believe you are the only one here
Look around, you're not alone
Feel the forces from another world
Ghostly shadows fill your mind
Evil power hanging over you
As you freeze, you're like a child
Look behind you!
Somebody's calling
Someone is near
Feel yourself falling
Falling with fear
You tell yourself you're dreaming
You realise you're screaming
You know that this shouldn't happen to you
You tell yourself that it's scary too
But there is nothing you can do, oh!
Ghostly shadows from the other world
Evil forces in your mind
Trapped between the worlds of life and death
Frozen in the realms of time
Look behind you!
You feel yourself falling, you're at the end of the line
Your body is crawling, but your senses are blind
Cold, cold feelings are running through your brains
Ice cold fingers, running through your veins
Got no time to be on the run,
Got no holes in my shoes,
You're the reasong all my friends have gone,
But I won't run from you.
So many promises, and you broke them all,
Oh I'll forgive, but I can't forget,
You know you're a fake, but I just can't take no more,
'Cause I'm tired of it.
I'm so tired, so tired,
Sick and tired of it all,
I'm so tired, sick and tired,
I'm so tired, sick and tired of it all, yeah.
You turn the truth, then you turn your back,
You're a victim of yourself,
The hate remains, the hurting still exists.
I'm so tired of it all.
I'm so tired, sick and tired,
So damn tired, sick and tired of it all, oh yeah,
I'm so tired, I'm sick and tired of it all.
I am the crazy man
Who lives inside your head
But I think I'm breaking through the wall
You are the innocent
Convicted of the crime
No one was ever there
To catch you when you fall
I see the diamonds
But you only see the rock
I need to run
But you only crawl
It's time to open up
All the doors that you keep locked
Nobody gives without a take
Let's take it all
You've been twisted into pieces
By the hands of your emotions
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father
One more crucifixion
One more cross to bear
You're a hole in a photograph
Go on lose it in the city
The city can feel no shame
See the world with electric eye
They call it mystery
But any fool could see
You thought he walked on the water
And if the pain was gone
And you were free to run away
And get out
Would you get out of there
Or do you really care
It's not safe or easy
And maybe when you're gone
You just won't belong at all
You're the only witness
To the murder of an angel
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father
It's just another crucifixion
One more cross to bear
Go on lose it in the city
Take a look at the world
You've got electric eyes
Red sun rising in the sky
Sleeping village, cockerels cry
Soft breeze blowing in the trees
Peace of mind, feel at ease
Slipping away, just a heartbeat from disaster
Nothing could make me stay, close your eyes and I'll be gone
Turn the page, yeah, time to start another story
Slipping away, slipping away, time to move along
No reason to stay
Oh, when I'm slipping away
Take a look at yourself, you've been running in a circle
Round and round you go, you're a start without an end
Start a new life, yeah, from the city of the gypsies
Running away, slipping away, right behind the plow
Slipping away
Slipping away
Nobody to pay
Look out, 'cause I'm slipping away
Rockin' the glass, I won't leave you my reflection
A future without a past, no more road to take me back
Come if you will, just don't question my direction
Running away, slipping away, we can find the sun
Slipping away
Slipping away
Got nobody to pay
And you're slippin' away
No more running in a circle
It's time to move along
Round, round, round we go
A start without an end
So I'm slipping away
Slipping away
What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles within my brain (cocaine)
Something blowing in my head
Winter's ice, it soon will spread
Death would freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold
My eyes are blind but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow
Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one who's really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turns my day to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?
What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles within my brain (cocaine)
Something blowing in my head
Winter's ice, it soon will spread
Death would freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold
My eyes are blind but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow
Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one who's really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turns my day to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?
My name it means nothing
My fortune is less
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on
Everything I possessed now they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
Oh where can I go to and what can I do?
Nothing can please me only thoughts are of you
You just laughed when I begged you to stay
I've not stopped crying since you went away, you went away, you went away
The world is a lonely place you're on your own
Guess I will go home sit down and moan
Crying and thinking is all that I do
Memories I have remind me of you, of you, of you
Sorcerers of madness
Selling me their time
Child of god sitting in the sun
Giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction
On a black snow sky
Sadness kills the superman
Even fathers cry
Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself and see
My world and know that it is good
You know that I should
Superstitious century
Didn't time go slow
Separating sanity
Watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker
Spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
In disguise
Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should
Watching eyes of celluloid
Tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor-replay
Give, give, give
Laughter kissing love is showing me the way
Spiral city architect
I build, you pay
Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my earth and feel the warmth
And know that it is good
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
So you think you know what's going on inside her head
You think she wants your money but it's you she wants instead
When you think about the things that she did long ago
It breaks your heart, but deep down boy, you don't want her to go
You really look so shattering
You feel you want to die
Just because of the one mistake of telling you a lie
If I were you I'd try again
And try to make amends
She only thinks of you, you know I'm talking as a friend
I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun but I don't need to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find a distant man a-waving his spoon
I've crossed the ocean, turned every bend
I found the crossing near a golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years and it never bothered me
Got no religion, don't need no friends
Got all I want and I don't need to pretend
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'd tear up your mind
I've seen the future and I've left it behind
Alright now
Won't you listen?
When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you, for your surprise
You introduced me, to my mind
And left me wanting, you and your kind, oh yeah
I love you, oh you know it
My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear, oh yeah
Come on now, try it out
Straight people don't know, what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf, oh yeah baby
Come on now, oh yeah
Try me out baby, alright, oh yeah
I want you part of this sweet leaf, oh yeah
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh try me out
I love you sweet leaf, oh
It's against my uniform
To be a civil judge
All the songs are history now
'Bout rock stars and their grudge
Let us cast our minds back
To thirty years or more
You took up all the vandals
Will Hitler beat 'em all?
And we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way
Yes we're sad and sorry
But why'd you have to treat us that way?
Compare ourselves with others
And cover them in sin
Oh, God what a terrible
A terrible state we're in
There must be some way out of here
A compromise that's right
If we cannot work it out
We're gonna have to fight
Yes we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way
Yes we're sad and sorry
We cannot go on in those days
I'm talking about my brothers
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout sisters as well
I wish you good luck
Good luck!
Oh, but the world's still on fire
Chain the hope you take on, liar
This fire
We're on fire, we're on fire, yeah
Take me through the centuries to supersonic years
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes
Mother moon she's calling me back to her silver womb
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seven hundredth unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Take my hand, my child of love come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years
With our love we'll ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Woman child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love
One day in the life of the lonely
Another day on the round about
What do they need
Somebody to love
One night in the life of the lonely
There's a miracle on the screen
What did they see
Somebody to love
He guarantees you instant glory
Get your money on the line
Gotta send me a plastic Jesus
There's a check in the mail today
That's what I need
Somebody to love
We just won't eat on Sunday
Gotta buy him a limousine
Somewhere to live
Somewhere to pray
Every penny from the people
Keeps the wolf outside the door
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he'll give you more, yeah
Holy father, holy ghost
Who's the one who pays the most
Rock the cradle don't you cry
Buy another lullaby
Jack is nimble, Jack is quick
Pick your pocket, turn a trick
Slow and steady, he's got time
To commit another TV crime
TV crime
One day in the life of the lonely
Back again on the round about
What do they need
Somebody to love
Yeah
One night in the life of the lonely
Another miracle on the screen
What did they see
Somebody to love again
A supermarket of salvation
Take a look inside the store
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he gives more
Holy father - holy ghost
Who's the one who hurts you most
Rock the cradle when you cry
Scream another lullaby
Jack be nimble, Jack be slick
Take the money, get out quick
Slow and steady, so much time
To commit another
TV Crime, TV Crime
One fine day in Hell
The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to Glory
There are whispers between the screams
That this deed can be done
Even sinners must dream
And I can be the one to make the Devil cry
I can win this game
If all things come together
I know this sounds quite strange
I won't be smart, just clever
It's the law on the other side
Just the kill lets you run
And how many have tried?
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry
At last my time has come
I must not give him pleasure
I can be the one
One chance or burn forever
So I told him about my pain
And the life I've been through
He just smiled and the laughter came
Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil cried
Tears from his eyes
Eyes of fire
And the devil cried
Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you
Falling
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all
Tonight
When the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand
That holds the knife,
And the knife that cuts the cable, kills the spark that
Feeds the life.
[Chorus]
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we
Were able,
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that
Rocks the cradle.
The oath you take is sacred, to save not steel a life,
Like the passing of the sweetest soul, that looked
Through human eyes.
[Chorus]
Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you
Falling.
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all
Tonight.
[Chorus]
It's the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand that
Steals the life.
What is it that turns you on to the illusion of power,
This thing that grabs you by the heart and makes you want to tear things down.
There is no reason why I should need all this power, but if you cross me now,
I'm gonna tear your whole world down.
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.
I can' get the emotional thing straight in my head,
Everything I love dies to soon, or is already dead.
Don't stand too close I spit and breath fire,
Anything I've got now you cannot desire.
You want to be my friend I promise you nothing,
Nothing I can give you, nothing I can do for you,
I'm being chased by the sins of my past and it's killing me now,
Killing me now.
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,
The illusion of power.
Powerful, who are you fooling?
You're caught in a complex cataclysm of your own inadequacies
And pitiful weaknesses
Your souls secretes insecurity
So you live on the reflection side of the mirror
You're terrified of true power...you fear me...
I can tell you stories of my
Shaded past and I can
Drag you down into the
Depths of my soul.
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,
The illusion of power.
Why don't you come closer, Promise a story I will tell, yeah,
I'll save you from your dreams, yeah
I'll save you from your dreams.
The horizon breaks, where a figure stands
Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command
[Chorus]
He's evil and mysterious, people fear his name
He's not here for deliverance, no
He's the Lawmaker
He newer speaks, but his task we're told
To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold
[Chorus]
Silver mountains won't save you from hell
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell
Oh your weakness your past
The Lawmaker comes
[Chorus]
He's the Lawmaker
Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
The mob rules
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, oh
It's over, it's done
The end is begun
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
You've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to fools
Break the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back around
You're all fools
The mob rules
Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein 
World Possessions, endless tears 
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years 
World turns slowly, sun don't shine 
Silence stills the air and kills the chime 
Words are poison, passion bleeds 
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds
 
The time of dreams has turned 
The night is gone and the light shines on 
Where darkness once would hide 
With spirits high, our fears were born 
[Chorus]
Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you 
Keep you from a restless heart 
Deceiver of night the stranger that laughs 
Within you, the reason for your restless heart 
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones 
Fire and water, wind and rain 
Wings that carry hell in every vein 
World turns slowly, sun don't shine 
Silence stills the air and kills the chime 
Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer each step brings fear 
The eyes of they that see have evil stare 
Watch over me
 
[Chorus]
And He's the keeper if the Sabbath Stones 
What God is this that stands to hear his people cry? 
What hand would strike and watch his people die? What life that takes, what future did we earn? It's our mistakes, take heed the Sabbath Stones 
What life that takes what future did we earn? It's our mistakes
There's a man who sees all there is to see
What the future holds for all
As the days grow dark with the grim and final warning
Beware of the ones with invisible friends
They will steal into your mind
And all too soon the signs begin to show
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
As the pages turn and the story's told
From the visions he's seen
The house on the hill
With the haunted eyes that call
no one laughed as madness came out
To play it's game
If you stay too long you'll finally go insane
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
Bells will take their toll
On your way
There's no way we're born to shine
Before our time, all your life
You're on your own
Lonely road
Lost in a time
Let the light lead your way
To the golden throne
It's the only way
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Oh rise up, to the shining
Wise up they're gonna steal your mind
Rise up, the house is gonna haunt you
No one laughed, no one cried
You stayed too long
You're finally gonna stay
If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe? 
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah
Fade away, fade away
Vanish into smoke
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball, oh!
It's the sign
Feels like the time!
On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere, oh
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo doesn't answer
When it hears a certain sound
Then the beast is free to wander
But never is seen around
And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
All right
Sail away
To the sign
Oh
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Giving life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of signs
And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymore
Oh!
On a real world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere oh
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
When the summer falls
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong!
It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Don't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away!
Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The sign of the southern cross, yeah
Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, a wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
The way I feel is the way I am
I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you
Just to you
What kind of people do you think we are?
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you
Just for you
The faithful image of another man
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you
Yeah for you
The shot troopers laying down on the floor
I wish they'd put an end to my running war with you
Yeah with you
Are you metal, are you man?
You've changed in life since you began
Yeah began
Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now you're through
Yeah you're through
You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the deck that you never heard came through
Yeah came through
Your folly finally got to spend with a gun
A poisoned father who has poisoned his son, that's you
Yeah that's you
I beg you please don't let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah curse you
All of the promises that never came true
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true
Ah, that's true
Are you Satan, are you man?
You've changed in life since it began
It began
Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now you're through
(Cats, rats)
The search is on, so you just better run
And find yourself another way
Probably dead, they don't feel a thing
To keep them living for another day
(Rats, rat)
You are nonentity, you have no destiny
You are a victim of a thing unknown
A mantle picture of a stolen soul
A fornication of your golden throne
A smiling face, it means the world to me, yeah
So tired of sadness and of misery
My life it started some time ago
Where it will end, I don't know
I thought I was so good
I thought I was fine
I feel my world is out of time
But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind
I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know
Listen to me while I sing this song
You might just think the words are wrong
Too many people advising me
But they don't know what my eyes see
But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind, yeah
Inclination of direction, walk the turned and twisted rift
With the children of creation futuristic dreams we sift
Clutching violently we whisper with a liquefying cry
Any deadly final answers that are surely doomed to die
Won't you help me Mr. Jesus, won't you tell me if you can?
When you see this world we live in, do you still believe in man?
If my songs become my freedom, and my freedom turns to gold
Then I'll ask the final question, if the answer could be sold
Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it
'Cause I've got no reason to lie, yeah
Forget your problems that don't even exist
And I'll show you a way to get high, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
So come along, you know you matter to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Don't you think that I know my own mind, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Why can't you believe, it's not here to perceive
Do you always have to be told, yeah
For you have been taught that if your mind has been bought
Life's entire answer was sold, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh what are you gonna do
When there's a part of you
That needs to run with the wind
And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from
The garden of the dark
Stay out of shadows
Now look like the change is on
Tomorrow's never gone
Today just never comes
Go on and jump,yeah
Into the hurricane
You will forger the pain
It's only there
To exorcise your mind
Looking at the world
When you've open up your eyes
You've got to see the promises they've made
They're bloody lies and broken dreams
Your silence screams
You're living in a time machine
And you can choose just who you are
Someone that you've never seen
Somewhere you've never been
You're living in a time machine
Oh what are you gonna do
When every part of you
Just needs to catch the wind
And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from
The garden of the dark
Looking for the world
When you've opened up your eyes
You'll see you've got invisible chains
They're only lies
Not what it seems
I hear your silent screams
You're living in a time machine
Nobody cares just where you go
Taken where you've never been
Somewhere you don't know
You're living in a time machine
Why do you stay who you are
Be what you've never been
Someone you've never seen
You're living in a time machine
Yeah
Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartaches
Before it takes me away from my mind
Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes that can spin in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead
When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And then tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me
So realize I'm much better without you
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living
So this time I'm gonna have to depart
Soon it's never more
When you've got to pay for
Promises, made in the night
Call the magic one
And with the magic comes
Forever chained to the flame
It's too late
Too late for tears
Too late
And no one hears you
Do you feel a touch of evil
(Then) It's too late
To wish and make it so
To feel the power growing
Stronger, blessed by the dark
And when the candle fades
You can say it was a
Joke you played
So you must let me go, no
It's too late
You've said the word
Too late
Something heard you
Too late, now the race is on
And you're run out of road
Too late
For tears
Too late
And no one hears you
Can you feel the touch of evil
It's too late
Oh oh oh save me
I believe in your name
Oh oh I've fallen down
But now I've found
Nobody to take the blame
Misery
It's come to drag me away
And when the hunter cries
No alibis
Get ready for judgment day
As the candle fades
You can say it was a game you made
So you must let me go, let me go
It's too late, you've said the word
Too late, something heard you
Too late, the spell is gone
And this time you're the fool
It's too late for tears
Too late
And no one hears you
Welcome to forever
Welcome it's too late
Too late
It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye
I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an only patch
Inebriation
Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes
So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cause there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still
Well bless my soul
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold, yeah
Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know
So let it all go!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!
Night time sorrow, taken like a pain
Black will not become a white, it's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
So get a good hold, yeah
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
If it feels right
Turn off the light!
Turn up the night!
She came from the past
She was never meant to last
Her destiny was fatal
From the start
A messenger from hell
She cast a deadly spell
On all of those who dare
To cross her heart 
Ain't no use in you trying to run
Fate has taken it's toll
Just one look and the damage is done
Burn your eyes
Turn your heart into stone
History foretold of a circle
Cast in gold
An evil seed of power
Sealed within
But fate has lent a hand
Destroyed the golden band
And freed her soul
To wash the land with sin
Ain't no use in you trying to run
Fate has taken it's toll
Just one look and the damage is done
Burn your eyes
Turn your heart into stone
She cast a deadly spell
She put a spell on you
She's got evil in her heart
Turn your heart into stone
Turn your heart into stone
Well, I don't want no Jesus freak to
Tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me
To cut my soul out
Don't believe in violence
I don't even believe in me
I've opened the door
And my mind has been released
Well I don't want no preacher
Telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me
Where I'm gonna go when I die
I want to live my life, I don't want
People telling me what to do
I just believe in myself
'cause no one else is true
Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate them
People riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe
So believe what I tell you
It's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe what I tell you
You shouldn't have to pretend
So don't let those empty people
Try and interfere with your mind
Go and live your life
And leave them all behind
Leading us on, to the land of Eternity
Riding the cold cold winds of Valhalla
The Kingdom of Odin is the Kingdom of Gods
Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace
But someone among them had the skill of deceit
And raised the hand that would open the road to Hell
[Chorus]
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Valhalla
The ring has been broken and a soul must be saved
Among the bravest of men, who rides to Hell
The long ships are sailing and the chariots ride
And yes the anger of Thor will serve you well
[Chorus]
Raise your hands
Reach and Valhalla will save your soul
Raise your eyes
And Odin will lead us on
They say that history repeats itself
Upon the year of the seventh Century
Well nobody knows no you never can tell
So you'd better run now and hide away
[Chorus]
Reach out and take for me, fruit of the poison
Tree,
Give me your body and your soul.
My youth is fading fast, years melt into the past,
This mortal life will take it's toll.
I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so
Amusing,
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in.
This park of natures fire, my only one desire,
This world is hanging by a thread.
I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so
Amusing,
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in.
People always tried to change me, alter everything
I am,
Though you find this so amusing, you left me in
This state I'm in.
Virtual death
You may think this existence, is just a human
Weakness,
Inside my mind it's near the end.
Virtual death
I'm losing, I'm fading fast. I'm dying, virtual death.
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin you do will be new, 'cause I'm through
Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
Some can't accept but I crept inside you
So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
'Cause it's Voodoo, oh!
Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till your mine and you learn
So if a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes
'Cause he's Voodoo!
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin you do will be new, 'cause I'm through
Voodoo!
Bring me your children, they'll burn!
Never look back, never turn!
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo!!
Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floor
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more
She's got the look of freedom, and it makes you think she's wild
But I can see right through it all, it's the way to have a child
Oh, walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Walk away, walk on
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all
Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls
I've never been lonely, and I can't imagine why
Maybe she could be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die
Can't see her fire
But I can feel her heat, all right
It's rising higher
I'm walking the wire
Walk on by
Oh, walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Oh, walk on by, walk away
Oh, oh, oh walk on, walk on, walk on, walk way
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher
But don't be fooled, just turn your head and walk away
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord yeah!
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor
Yeah
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgment day comes
Yeah!
Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of judgment, God is calling
On their knees the war pig's crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh lord yeah!
Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
Tell me who am I to blame?
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong
Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong
He saw the world, dim with the glow of the vertical sun
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.
When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying
When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed
When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow
When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow
Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer
For I believe Satan lives, in the souls of the dying
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.
When Death Calls - Heaven is closer
When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When Death Calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
When Death Calls - You're gonna burn
Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister
Can't die until Satan says you die
And Satan takes your soul
In the face of death or your toungue will blister
Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister
Can't die until Satan says you die
The Devil takes your soul
With all his wrath he calls the reaper
When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying
When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed
When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow
When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow
When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When Death Calls - You're gonna burn, burn, burn
When Death Calls - Heaven is closer
When Death Calls - I can feel it, gonna take you down
Yes I know the secret
That's within your mind
You think all the people
Who worship you are blind
You're just like big brother
Giving us your trust
And when you have played enough
You'll just cast our souls
Into the dust
Into the dust
You thought that it would be easy
From the very start
Now I've found you out
I don't think you're so smart
I only have one more question
Before my time is through
Please I beg you tell me
In the name of hell
Who are you?
Who are you?
You thought that it would be easy
From the very start
Now I've found you out
I don't think you're so smart
I only have one more question
Before my time is through
Please I beg you tell me
In the name of hell
Who are you?
Who are you?
The world today is such a wicked thing
Fighting going on between the human race
People give good wishes to all their friends
While people just across the sea are counting the dead
A politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
While people here on earth are dying of old diseases
A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
He doesn't even know who is his father
Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real
Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Don't you know that I might be
Your wishing well
Your wishing well
Look in the water, tell me what do you see
Reflections of the love you give to me
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
So let me fill myself with tears you cry and why? 
Time is a never ending journey
Love is a never ending smile
Give me a sign to build a dream on
Dream on
Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on
Yeah, throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
Let me fill myself with tears you cry
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Someday, some way, you'll feel the things I say
Dream for a while
Of the things that make you smile
'Cause you know
Don't you know
Oh, you know
That I'm your wishing well
Your wishing well
Your wishing well
I wish you well
I'm your wishing well
Astral engines in reverse
I'm falling through the universe again
Down among a dead mans vision
Faded dreams and nuclear fissions span
The strings of fear they are holding up the race
The puppets falling to the ground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found
On this sinking ship I travel
Faster than the speed of life
Not so super nova burns
The black holes turn and fade from sight
The strings of fear they hide within the human race
The answers buried underground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found
And very soon
The boundless moon
Will show us light
And as we crash
We'll pray and kiss
And say goodnight
Goodnight
Accept the fact that you're second rate life is easy for you
It's all served up on a gold plated plate
And we don't even have to talk to you
Your face is normal that's the way you're bred
And that's the way you're going to stay
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
But someone else's finger's on the control panel
What you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Don't you want to be brother - Zero the hero
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero
You sit there watch it all burn down
It's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge no edge you got no knife have you
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver
You stand there captain we all look
You really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing
I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet 
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
I am the world that hides the universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime
I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child who never was conceived
When little worlds collide 
I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories
Are cast into the never ending well
The name that scorns the face 
The child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that
Belies the face of those who never ran
You got belive it, I'm talking to you
Well I know its hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on
I want you to listen, I'm trying to get throught 
Love has given life to you and now its your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still I look but not to touch 
The seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls
The secret stays unknown
Just remember love is life
And hate is living death
Treat your life for what its worth 
And live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned
But now I'm wondering 
Here I wait and only guess
What this next life will bring
Ha ha
What do you say to the dead?
Will you forgive me for living?
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing
It's killing me!
What do they do with your soul?
Is it just lying there busted?
When did you lose all control?
Is there someone to be trusted with my mind?
Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughter
Are we all haunted by the ghost - imagination?
It just can't be, I've seen them there howling at the moon
Is it just me or does somebody else, believe this
Well I'm not alone and I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see after all
After all
After all
After all
What do you say to the dead?
Is there a place where it's burning?
It says in a book I once read
Yes, there's a chance of returning
Turn to me
The fundamental principles
Say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear
Or I'm just not so clever
It can't be me I know somebody else, believes this
Well I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
Just one way to see after all
After all
Coming after all
After all
After all
Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of a
Shattered world that's gonna die
In the Age of Reason
how do we survive?
The protocols of evil
Ravaging so many lives?
So many lives
So many lives
Mystifying silence
Talking Peace on Earth
We should judge each other
For ourselves not what we're worth
Sustainable extinction
A fractured human race
A jaded revolution
Disappears without a trace
without a trace
without a trace
Alrigth yeah
Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don't bear fruit
oh yeah,
these time are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over
But the war goes on
Politics, religion
Love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah
She sits in silence, in her midnight world
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away
And as the seasons turn the days to years
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen
And now she dances only in her dreams
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away
Super animation, turning on a nation
And they're saying all moving parts stand still
Since he was elected, adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero he's got them all on the run
Yes he's won, yeah
Since he passed the motion, they're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should be free
What a combination, peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain,
And the rain, ain't that strange?
Very strange, yeah
I like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school
He's had enough of sticking to the rules, alright
People stop and see
He's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine
Pretty silly ladies, all Cynthia's and Sadie's
Call him and he takes their numbers down
Says he is a woman, should have seen it coming
And she says she's married to a clown
Just like a lady she'll keep you guessing through the night
Not tonight, well I might Oh alright, yeah
Everybody's looking at me
Feeling paranoid inside
When I step outside I'll feel free
Think I'll find a place to hide
Tell me people, am I going insane, insane? 
Tell me people, am I going insane, insane? 
Every day I sit and wonder
How my life it used to be
Now I feel I'm going under
Now my life is hard to see
So tell me people, am I going insane, insane? 
Tell me people, am I going insane, insane? 
So I'm telling all you people
Listen while I sing again
If I don't sound very cheerful
I think that I'm a schizophrenic
So, tell me people, am I going insane, insane? 
Tell me people, am I going insane, insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane, insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane, insane?
There's no end, there's no beginning
To the old man's story
Does he still remember me
From lives gone by
Oh I see his spirit rising
Upon the back of time
I've got nowhere to hide
Will he keep a place for me
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
In his eyes an ocean's burning
Swollen seas of tears
Troubled mind the beating
War drums in his ears
No one ever hears his warning
Am I the one he calls
When they tell me they're afraid
Some say I'll be put away
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
My blood will spill my blood
My blood will spill my blood
In the wisdom of the prophet's
Never ending tale
Open up the eyes
Within your mind, he says
Crowned in his ancient glory
There's a king within us all
Some will say it's all in vain
That he doesn't have a name
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
I still remember how it used to be
I thought the only thing
That mattered was me
You always told me it was just insane
To feel such joy
While others feel pain
There's no way to change this angry heart
'Cause when love goes
It will tear you apart
And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a promised land
And the years slip by like so much sand
So many people who are dying to live
It tortures my heart
They've got so much to give
I never saw it as a battle before
To win the fight
There has to be more
And there's no way to change this angry heart
'Cause all these fears
Will tear you apart
And it's been this way since time began
It's an endless journey, it's the fate of man
To live each day and never understand
And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a master plan
And the years slip by like water through your hands
Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights

When it's over, find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
Anno Mundi, can you wonder
Truth or thunder, life or blame

Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?

There are people laughing, they're all laughing at you
If only they could see what you're saying was true, ooh yeah
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know? No, no, no

As the wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Anno Mundi, yeah

Do you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join in the war, do you fight for the 'cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone

As the wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old, no, no, no

Can you see me now, oh, can you hear me now? Oh, no
Can you tell me where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer, running in the rain
Truth or thunder, life or blame

There's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done

As the wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Your eyes are burning

As the wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Your eyes are burning
I'm just another back street kid
Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig
Can't stop the music going round inside my head
I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me
Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me
Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going
Got to see yourself in other's eye's, surprised?
Living like I want to don't come easy, but I'm trying
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise
Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands
So listen to the music, want to see you get so high
'Cause I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me
We are the star demons, reaching out yeah,
We want to touch your world,
We are the dream makers, pure and sweet yeah.
We're gonna change your world.
When you're tired of giving reasons
And freedom fighting freedom
If you're searching for an answer,
We can bring you back to Eden.
There's no need for pain and anger,
The power of peace can destroy the gun.
Leave behind man's vanity yeah,
And living life on the run.
When you're tired of giving reasons
And freedom fighting freedom
If you're searching for an answer,
We can bring you back to Eden.
Is god forgiving, is this the final warning,
Watching as the future turns.
Science fiction, real life addiction.
The human race will never learn.
When you're tired of giving reasons
And freedom fighting freedom
If you're searching for an answer,
We can bring you back to Eden.
Oh the devil is rising with the moon
He cries and my blood runs cold.
Oh no never was the darkness so black,
No light and nowhere to go.
My spirit is crying for a love
So tired of being alone.
I remember He came here to steal,
And You are His stealer of souls.
I see a Black Moon rising,
And it's calling out my name.
Oh it's calling my name.
I've been blinded, lost and confused,
Darkness will call me no more.
Heaven is no friend of mine,
No god ever knocked on my door.
I see a Black Moon rising,
And it's calling out my name.
Oh it's calling my name.
I'm standing on the dark side of time
Reaching for the power of Her hand.
She's weaving an unholy light
And calls from Lucifer's land.
I see a Black Moon rising,
And it's calling out my name.
An angel of Hell is rising,
Heaven's no friend of mine.
I see a Black Moon rising,
And it's calling out my name,
I see a Black Moon rising,
And it causes so much pain.
An angel of Hell is rising,
Heaven's no friend of mine.
I see a Black Moon rising,
And it's calling out my name.
It's calling my name,
This spirit's crying for love.
Heaven's no friend of mine.
As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At the tapestries all faded
Their vague and distant glories
Concealed in the gloom
The icy fingers of forgotten passions
Softly brushing my lips
At the tips of my primitive soul
As you look through my door
Deep into my room
Can you feel the mighty wall of power
It's waiting waiting in the gloom
The distant shadows of forgotten champions
Those who live in me still
And will rise when we challenge and kill
Born again
You'll be born again
Look at this prince of evil
Fighting for your mind
Fighting all priests of shame
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed
At the hearts of mutant gods
Who think we're all the same
They're controlling our minds
And they use us for fortune and fame
As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At your future and freedom
The grey and plastic retards all floating in circles
And as you taste the fruits of new sensations
Softly brushing your lips
As we rise when we challenge and kill
Born again
You'll be born again
If you want to be a king for a day
Just do what I say
Everybody's got to think like a hunter
Just search for your pray
Be alive through the night and the day
Just do it my way
I'll play your game
But if you lose you're gonna have to pay the price
Broken chains, like a prisoner free at last
The fear inside just up and died
Time will tell if i am wrong
It won't be too long
You thing I'm chasing shadows
In the dark
Well I'm not born to lose
I'm not born to lose
You curse my name, as you turn and walk away, from view
It won't be too long
You don't scare me 'cause you're
Hard to see and it's time
That you were gone
It won't be too long
You think I'm chasing shadows
In the dark
Well I'm not born to lose
You think I'm chasing shadows
In the dark
What you gonna do about it now
What you gonna do about it now
It won't be too long
It won't be too long
It won't be too long
You think I'm chasing shadows
In the dark
What you gonna do about it now
What you gonna do about it now
Ain't nothing I can do about it now
[Instumental]
Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from temptation
You got lost
And found that you don't
Belong to anybody
You're all the same
Just another number
Cross it out
Whenever you don't behave
Someone got the doctor
He knows what to do
Throw some bones and mumble
The devil's inside of you
It might be contagious
It might change the plan
Get back in your tiny boxes
Even if you can't
We say you can
Join the congregation
Everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie
Pre-chorus:
When you thought you were free
You didn't need a reason
No reason to survive
Chorus:
As the big door closes
And you waiting for the nail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive
Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from tomorrow
You got lost
And found that another
Day has turned to ashes
Taken by the wind
Frozen seeds of sorrow
Never to begin
Join the celebration
And everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie
Pre-chorus:
When you thought you were free
You did not need a reason
No reason to survive
Chorus:
As the big door closes
And you waiting for the mail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive
One more nightmare
Just one more time
Join the congregation
Everybody get in line
Celebration
The choir sings a lie
As you call
The hammer falls
And no one hears you cry
I'm buried alive
How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Why do you believe that we've got something coming,
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,
Too far away.
In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
All I need is understanding and the right to survive,
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we had they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away, too far away, too far away.
Where do you go when your conscience takes over
Do you crawl to your corner and cry,
Did you imagine, that no one would notice
Just a secret to take when you die.
All the world is watching you, every tongue is
Screaming sinner.
How are your dreams, do they claw at your sleep
Making darkness a place you despise,
Where is the god, that once was your strength
Are you sure he was there from the start.
All the world is watching you, nowhere you can hide,
Every tongue is screaming sinner, only satan hears your cries.
When you sin cardinal sin, you make your bed and on it you must lie,
And your futures looking grim, but did you ever give a damn
About the child, he's running wild,
When you sin cardinal sin, don't you expect the world will treat you well,
We say oh, go to hell.
We point the finger, sin cardinal sin, laugh in your face, sin
Cardinal sin,
We point the finger, laugh in your face,
Cos you're no better than the rest of the human race.
Oh sin cardinal sin, oh sin cardinal sin.
I feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I lost the best friend
That I ever had
She was my woman
I loved her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found a way
But soon the world
Had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went astray
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
It took so long
To realize
And I can still hear
Her last goodbyes
Now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
Revolution in their minds the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear, yeah
So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the words today
Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah
(Children of the grave)
Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision, genocide
Computerize God, it's the new religion
Program the brain, not the heartbeat
Onward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow, energize
Digital dreams
And you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeah
Take a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel
[Chorus:]
There's another side of heaven
This way, to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down
Love is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate, it's a calculation
Send in the child for connection
Take a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real
[Chorus]
Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasy
Your past is your future
Left behind
Lost in time
Will you surrender
Waiting for the revolution
Program the brain
Not the heartbeat
Deliver us to evil
Deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populate
Virtual existence
With a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation
Destroyer of mankind
Termination of our youth
For we do not compute
No!
Too much near the truth they say
Keep it 'til another day
Let them have their little game
Delusion helps to keep them sane
 
Let them have their little toys
Matchbox cars and more kids joys
Exciting in their plastic ways
Frozen food in a concrete place
 
Your gonna go insane
I'm tryin' to save your brain
 
Alright
 
I don't know what's happening
My head's all torn inside
People say I'm heavy
They don't know what I hide
 
Take a life it's going cheap
Kill someone no one will weep
Freedom's yours just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use
 
Your gonna go insane
I'm tryin' to save your brain
Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah
We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air
In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars,
the endless search for where you are
(sail on, sail on)
Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!
Don't sail away on a crimson tide!
Don't leave your heart on the other side!
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire with a special name
Don't ever fall in love!
Don't give your heart away!
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!
Don't come closer, cos it ain't safe here,
Just turn around now and walk away.
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here,
Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there,
Behind those eyes.
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
Hands.
From a cross of thorns.
Tongues of fire always talking, wasted words that
Ring in my ears.
We're still waiting, losing patience. Will all the lies
Of, 400 years.
I've got to tell you, there are no rules here,
Sometimes I wonder,
What goes on there, behind those eyes.
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
Hands.
From a cross of thorns.
We gave you yesterdays, and now you want to-day,
Oh, from the hands of death we take our daily bread,
Now all we do is choke, and the words that you once
Spoke, fade away.
Look at what you've done, oh, it's a cross of thorns.
Take away, this cross of thorns, look at what you've
Done,
It's a cross of thorns, cross of thorns.
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
You've got blood on your hands, from a cross of
Thorns.
Born in a graveyard adopted by sin
I cultivate evil that's living within
A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul
Possessed by a demon that had full control
The time it is coming when all life will end
With doomsday approaching to hell we'll descend
Religion won't save me, the damage is done
The future has ended before it's begun
Death's hand and the crazy, I can't stand the light of day
Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray
God of the almighty never answers their call
Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him
I don't mind dying 'cause I'm already dead
Pray not for the living I'll live in your head
Dying is easy it's living that's hard
I'm losing the battle between Satan and God
Midnight, something don't feel right
It's been too much, too far away from home
Hard life, living the hard life
I can't resist, I'm falling
To the danger zone
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone
Red light, don't stop for no red light
You know I'm always trouble on my own
Lonely, ever so lonely
I've got too much time
I'm heading for the danger zone
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone
I'm eager, eager to please
I can't stand no more
It's got me on my knees
Ain't gonna feel no hurt
Ain't gonna feel no pain
I got nothin' left to lose
I ain't got no shame
Don't try to stop me
Just leave me on my own
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone
I'm living in the danger zone
In the danger zone
Hard life, I'm living the hard life
I'm gonna take a chance
In the danger zone
Lonely, ever so lonely
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone4
Midnight, can't wait until midnight
Help e I'm falling to the danger zone
A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed
The truth destroys you, its no longer concealed
Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin
Yeah, in ruin, yeah
You preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole
Indoctrination by a twisted desire
The catechism of an evil messiah
Dear father forgive me, I know just what I'm doing
In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin
Yeah, in ruin, yeah
Preacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy
Under false sanctity, holy phoney empathy
You have taken my life
Now it's your turn to die
Can you sleep at night? when you close your eyes
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?
Or do you deny you're responsible
For the victims of the sins you devised?
What you gonna tell them when they ask you? well then
Is your conscience pure in your heart?
There is no exemption when you seek redemption
For all the lives that you've torn apart
Your molestations of the cross you defiled
A man once holy now despised and reviled
You took possession while confessing my sins
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeah
Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin, yeah
In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah
In ruin yeah
Silence is mocking, the dawn of a new day
Devil and Daughter, are both on their way
The Evil of her nature, collects in her eyes
With him there's no fear, of the dawn bringing light
Baptised with fire, to wild to be tamed
She's hot, evil and ready, to take any man
Let no one put asunder, the power or the pain
He is the master of hell, riding again
Devil and Daughter - pleasure and pain
Devil and Daughter - is this the end
A thousand times over, you'll hear on the wind
In the name of hell, these sinners never sinned
But Satan never listens, to the words that they send
Drenching the soil with blood, when will it end
Devil and Daughter
He's got the power she's got the pain
Devil and Daughter
She'll break any woman and take any man
Devil and Daughter
Hand in hand with the reper
He wears her leather just to satisfy
She really throws it around
There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy
She's the richest bitch in town
Her big fat daddy was a money machine
He made a fortune from computers
She's got more money than I've ever seen
But she's a greedy emotional looter
Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch
She's got five rollers and a fine estate
A big house upon hill
She throws parties just to celebrate
Her life is just one ginormous thrill
She buys poor people just to have around
She has a trophy for each lover
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound
She's got a lot more to discover
Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil
But she's just imitation woman up for sale
She got so famous that she's on TV
She's got a professional smile
But I switch over 'cause she ain't for me
She disturbs me all the while
She looks so happy but she's got it wrong
She's always going faster
She sings her life to such a different song
She needs a loving and dominant master
The neon lights are shining on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night
If I could find one then everything would be alright
The sleepy city is dreaming the nigh time away
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today
I see a man,he's got take away women for sale
Yes for sale
Guess that's the answer
'cause take away women don't fail
Oh dirty women,they don't mess around
Oh dirty women,they don't mess around
You've got me coming
You've got me going around
Oh dirty women,
They don't mess around
Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen
Gotta be good then everything will be o.k.
if I could score tonight then I will end up happy
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day
Let's try getting to the sky
Hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet
It's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile
Watched closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries
Keep looking at the eyes
Good life is contradiction
Because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seed
You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers fan electric lies
We're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all not at all not in the least
The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set a light
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and the night and day
The force of the devil that we're all told to fear
Watched out for religion when he gets too near too near
Can you hear, the people sing their song,
To tunes of glory, they move as one.
Refugees of liberation marching on,
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.
When you take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's
Left is humanity.
It's getting closer, change is bound to come.
There's someone out there, holding candles to the
Sun.
Then an answer, says that peace will come around,
Stand in line, take your time and be proud.
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is
Humanity,
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you
And me.
Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.
Refugees of liberation marching on,
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is
Humanity,
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you
And me.
Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.
Hear them call you, dying for love, those who know
You, dying for love.
Brothers, sisters, dying for love, saints and sinners,
Dying for love,
Dying for love.

Hello, can you hear me? I might not be alone
Don't see anyone near me but I just won't go home again
Let's meet in the morning, I just can't speak tonight
This is more than a warning, be silent 'till it's light
And then you know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all makes my flesh start to crawl
I've seen an ear in the wall
This time, it could prove it but you've heard this all before
Cry wolf and you're moving to a special kind of danger zone
I need a witness, somebody just like you
So bring an exorcist, a wizard and the holy ghost
You know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all makes my flesh creep and crawl
I've seen an ear in the wall
One more reason, one more time
Someone's searching through my mind
Now where am I supposed to go
It's not who you are, it's who you know
What's it gonna be?
I knew you would answer, I'm the curiosity
You could miss a chance because the fool might see reality
There it is, in the corner, you must be going blind
What's wrong? Were you born before your God invented eyes?
It's got to be there, grinding away at my secrets
It's growing so dark and you can't see it all
I'll turn on some lights so you're sure not to fall
It's next to the eye in the wall
Reflex in the sky warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you'd better hide from the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay, radiation minds decay
Robot minds of robot slaves lead them to atomic rage
Plastic flowers, melting sun, fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation, victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of oxy'n fire, like electric funeral pyre
Buildings crashing down to a cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood, ice melting to flood
Earth lies in death bed, clouds cry water dead
Tearing life away, here's the burning pay
Electric funeral
Electric funeral
Electric funeral
Electric funeral
And so in the sky shines the electric eye
Supernatural king takes earth under his wing
Heaven's golden chorus sings, hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to hell, ever trapped in burning cell
Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?

Reanimation of the sequence
Rewinds the future to the past
To find the source of the solution
The system has to be repaired

Release your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul
Your life's on overload
Is this your fate?

Will you decide what makes you an entity
That's your identity
Well if you don't know
Which way to go

You might be lost and confused
A second chance no time to lose

Reanimation of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate
Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too late

You don't want to be a robot ghost
Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free

Alright-okay, alright
Till they set you free
Alright-okay
Till they set you free

I don't want to see you, yeah
I don't want to see you, yeah
No one said it had to be this way
Why are we the victims of their final word
Dying world is killing us so slowly
I believe no god may save us now
Can't you see what I see
Sinners say your prayers tonight
Your judgment day is here
Child tomorrow will die, not even
Born jesus our questions
He never seems to hear
Dying for the answers may be
The price we pay, to find the
Key to our lives
Is there a heaven is there a hell
Who's this god, tell me there's
No god above, why
We chose what lord, deep
Within our souls
He's not one thing
We are his spirit
We could save this world
From destruction day
Can't you see what I see
You and I victims of their word
As the masters of power
Try to poison our world
Greed money taken over
Their souls, you're
Just mechanical brains
Politicians don't know
Just don't know
We can chance this world we
Live in, don't let it die
Something about the way that you look on me,
You watch every move, every word, every fantasy,
Got no time for love, there's something on your mind,
Got the face of an angel but the stare of a devil inside.
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,
People say the woman's got an evil eye.
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,
Free me from the woman with the evil eye.
I turn away but still I see that evil stare,
Trapped inside my dreams I know you're there.
Thoughts of happiness you destroyed them all,
First inside my head, then inside my soul.
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,
People say the woman's got an evil eye.
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,
Free me from the woman with the evil eye.
Goin' home, late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked through a window and surprised what I saw
A fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf
All right now
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Oh all right now!
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes,
All right now!
So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said son, son, you've gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do
Yeah
I think about closing the door
And lately I think of it more
I'm living well out of my time
I feel like I'm losing my mind
I should be at the table round
A servant of the crown
The keeper of the sign
To sparkle and to shine
Never, no never again!
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can
Never, this is the end
You know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man
Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain
Save me, take me away
You know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!
I've got to be strong
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
Think you're safe, but you're wrong!
We are falling off the edge of the world!
Look out! there's danger! no where to run!
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done
Over, it's over at last
There's a message inside as we build a new life from the past
We're falling off the edge of the world!
Yes, the edge of the world!
It's the end of the world!
The chapter is opened and the pages are turned
The writting say many things but who was concerned
Where can we run to now, when will we learn?
When it's lost gone forever
For years they told me what I should to do
Down to the places I go and who I should talk to
But that don't matter no more since I found out the truth
And it feels good to me
The world is turnin'
Forever turnin'
Forever yearnin'
For the love of life
And you're wrong if think that I'm afraid to love
I wonder, I wonder does it not seem strange to you
Just how the tables have turned on me and you?
How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?
When it's lost it's gone forever
It feels good to me, etc.
I should be calling collect from jail
For the things I commit each night in my head
Like last night in my sleep I got to snuff you
But then I woke up again, safe in my little bed
No one is safe when I close my eyes I come to take your life
I get to force your untimely disappearance
Each night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleep
I close my eyes, and you just vanish soon as I
Lay down my head when I'm dead to the whole wide world
No one is safe when I close my eyes I come to take your life
And then I wake up again and it was all just a dream
And everything is the same
(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoes
And throw you off of a bridge?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul's mine to keep I feel you near me
Go to sleep, Sleepwalker
Just taking a stroll; don't go to sleep! 
Here's some toothpicks for your eyes!
You always make an excellent cadaver
I roll your body up in a carpet to make music in the
Trunk of my limousine, wrapped up in a rug
A fitting end is that I send you up the river like a punk
No one is safe when I close my eyes I come to take your life
The angel of death is pissed off at me again
Just because I got to put you out of my misery
It doesn't matter; I am without fear
Now you're dead; I won't shed another bloody tear for you
No one is safe when I close my eyes I come to take your life
I'm calling down the thunder, then you'll sleep with the fishes
The answer to all of my wishes
(Sleepwalker) Did I tell you I was in movies
Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch?
(Sleepwalker) Everyday, another way
I know you can hear me
I think you'd look nice in a Colombian necktie
Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog
No more stupidity from you, as I pull your tongue through
For a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hear
No one is safe when I close my eyes I come to take your life
And then I wake up and it was all just a dream
And everything is still the same
(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoes
And throw your body off of a bridge?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep I feel you near me
(Sleepwalker) Or did I tell you I was in movies
Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch?
(Sleepwalker) Everyday, another way
I know you can hear me
(Sleepwalker) Did I buy you the farm
Put a horse head in your bed?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep; I feel you near me
(Sleepwalker) Everyday
Everyday, another way
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep; I know you can hear me
(Sleepwalker)
(Sleepwalker)
(Sleepwalker)
(Sleepwalker)
Your mind tells you that you've lost your confidence
You're drifting and ya don't believe in anyone
To lose what little you have left to be proud of
Afraid you can't do this again, ah! 
You said that nothing come in-between us
The way of getting things we wanted done
Then enissophobia held you under its influence
Until you compromised your style
Everything about you has been one big charade
What will you do now that the well's run dry? Cry?
To sell out all your friends and stab them in the back
It's something that you are, it's something that I'm not
When you forced me into doing what you love
Mark my words no one loves you very much, yeah mark em'
And when you tried to change me and tried to replace me
I couldn't help but end just hating you, hmm!
Being a fraud can only last so long, you should know
Till what ya sensed as a child returns, you little baby
To choke out the voice that told ya ?money and the fame?
Would fill the crater that you dug for yourself
Unlike you I'm no vision to myself, lest you forget
You didn't ever make metal, buddy; metal made you
To crush and run over everyone along the way
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not
A stranger to yourself, ha! ya pissed me off again
I won't be driven by your needs anymore
What you'd become to do or be is clear to see for me
It's something that you are; something that I'm not
It makes me sick to hear you say you ?love me?
I know you only love what I can do for you
If you were the one that was leading the charge
Would you notice if I missed a day or two? But that's impossible!
We all laughed at the parodies that you'd become
Now your pain slowly paid back has begun
So, accept my resignation, or in your words ?betrayal?
Before it gets much worse, end this self-sabotage
Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not 
Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not 
Something that you are, something I'm not, yet
Well, it's a strange way
The way you look at me
And it's a hard time
Time you been givin'
Open up to me
So you can realize
That I could set you free
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days
Well, it's a strange place
That you've been livin' in
And it's a strange line
You've been deliverin'
I think I like it
But I'm not really sure
Don't want to to fight it
Just want to feel some more
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days
His wicked Highness born from disaster
To dominate and to kill
A glistening murder machine
False majesty standing perfectly still
A blitzkrieg raining down evil
On a mountain of black ice
Like a good old fashioned beating within
Inches of your life

While alone and left abandoned
With the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you
As your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting
Through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love
Your sudden death from above

Once frozen like a prisoner depraved
Perched high atop the lithosphere
Set free from beneath the depths of hell
Bequeathing anything but despair
The beast is genetically programmed
Time to destroy, time to go berserk
To see the end of all wars
To see the end of the Earth

Stopping at nothing, punch drunk
From the blood that he's tasted
Tearing your soul apart
Not one bit of your pain will be wasted
Now death descends upon you
Like a bloody white dove
Bringing your retribution
Your sudden death from above

While alone and left abandoned
With the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you
As your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting
Through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love
Your sudden death from above
Hello me, meet the real me
And my misfit's way of life
A dark black past is my
Most valued possession
Hindsight is always 20-20
But looking back it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction?
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest!

Feeling paranoid
True enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and
My air is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things
I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit and my
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets

Hello me, it's me again
You can subdue but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache
Sinking down to your level
Yea, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance
Mankind has got to know
His limitations

Feeling claustrophobic
Like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands and
I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things
I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets

Well, me, it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Some day you too will know my pain
And smile its blacktooth grin
If the war inside my head
Won't take a day off I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again

Feeling paranoid
True enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me
And my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic
Like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands
And I don't know where I've been

Once you committed me
Now you've acquitted me
Claiming validity
For your stupidity
I'm chomping at the bit
I'm sharpening the axe
Here I come again, whoa
Sweating bullets
You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a'roll
A'roll, a' roll

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Of destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes, explodes

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony
Of destruction

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall, tall

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony
Of destruction
Got one chance, infiltrate them
Get it right, terminate them
The Panzers will, permeate them
Break their pride, denigrate them
And their people, retrograde them
Typhus, detriate them
Epidemic, devastate them
Take no prisoners, cremate them

Burn

Going to war,give'em hell
D-Day, next stop Normandie
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit we'll win
War is peace sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A heaven for those who walk this world
Bereft of heart and soul

Love and war they say all is fair
Take his life
But won't take his hair
Your body has parts your
Country can spare
By the way son here's
Your wheelchair

He once had to be all he could be
Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you & me
It's a funny thing, a funny thing
Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you
Take no prisoners, take no shit
Take no prisoners, take no shit
Take no prisoners, take no shit
Take no prisoners, take no shit
Take no prisoners, take no shit
This may seem all too confusing
How I could walk away from something so rare
But you see it all got too demanding, yeah
And I just didn't care, I just didn't care, if I cared, if I cared
Lately, I've been left wanting, but not wanting you
Attraction that once was is no longer there, ooh
And it sucks to be taken for granted
When the veil is drawn and there's only air
I had to walk away
Give up something I love
For what I loved even more
And save my tears for you
Everything has lost its meaning, I had to let it go
To find myself, myself, and start something new, brand new
Forced to look deep in the mirror, face who I really am
Now it's just me, cause I can't afford you
I had to walk away
Give up something I love
For what I loved even more
And save my tears for you
I gave up something I loved
For what I loved even more
And I saved my tears for you
In a vial and walked away
You were so beautiful to look upon
I could see the light in your smile 
Your eyes were the windows into your soul
Your body was heavenly just like the sky
Until all your good looks betrayed you, which ain't much
Counted on your counterfeit smiles for too long
Your eyes are empty windows: broken
The body may be here, but the soul is gone
I saved my tears for you in a vial
From everything wicked thing that you did, that you said
To send away, buried with your love
So many tears in a vial, now that you're gone,
And now that you're dead
Beginning of sorrow
There'll be no tomorrow
Beginning of sorrow
Easy prey, so innocent
She barely was a teen
Hooked up with mr. right now
A nightmare that stole her dreams
Complications come
The doctor says you gotta know
You decide if the baby lives
But one of you has got to go
The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, there'll be no tomorrow
The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow
There will be no tomorrow
Brought forth in agony
This life was misbegot
Born in an alleyway
A child nobody will adopt
Delinquent in a foster home
His heart is so full of rage
His first name's "ward"
His last name is "of the state"
Origo doloris non erit crastinus dies
Like father, like son
Soon he gets revenge
Two souls soon become one
The vicious cycle never ends
Unwanted, unloved
He lives now just to hate
From the pain of being born
And nothing can take that away
The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, there'll be no tomorrow
The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow
There will be no tomorrow
This cold, empty house is
So quiet now she's gone
The dust accumulates into
Mountains on the ground
My paper's piled on the steps
Her flowers all have died
I'm searching everywhere
For someone I'll never find
The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow
Shadows fill this place
She's been away so long
The wallpaper leaves a stain
Where pictures once belonged
You think I would have known
Something was going on
Her kisses were so cold
Her loving touch withdrawn
The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow
They never do teach you how to walk away from someone that you love
The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
I know t's too late, when you've lost your soul
The fires all but gone, my world is darker now
Than the blackest crow
The blackest crow
Welcome to our sanguinary sect or worship
Feel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathmastise
All those who oppose us.
Don't summon the devil,
Don't call the priests
If you need the strength,
The conjuring, obey!
Behold! the flames rise
From the compass' cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil,
And with the ashes you'll annoint
Arrange the symbols
Of the wizard and magician.
Light the candles,
Place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves place
The lash from a black cat's eye,
A straw of a broom,
Fold, burn and centralize.
Don't summon the devil,
Don't call the priests
If you need the strength,
The conjuring.
I am the devil's advocate
A salesman, if you will.
You know my name.
I met your father years ago
Gave him what he'd please.
He called my name, you'll do the same.
I'm claiming what is mine by right
It's time to close the deal.
You're bought and sold, bought and sold.
Come join me in my infernal depths,
Mephisto's Hall of Fame
I've got your soul, I've got your soul.
The conjuring. Obey!
From the dust of which I came
To dust I return again
From my mother I am torn
With my brothers off the war
We escape before the dawn
Try to outrun the sun
Take my own life in my hands
Fearing God but never man
Take my ancient hand, look me in the eye
Looking past the lines soon you'll see as I
You are young if you want you could be old if you try
I can show you how to live but you can't show me how to die
As the sun stalks the sky
I am not afraid to die
My ear upon the ground
For the ironhorse's sound
Encircle glowing rocks
One by one each chieftain talks
Tales of yore and bravest deeds
Coveting their warrior creed
My hands will bridge the distance of beginning to the end
The time for learning ceases it was all wasted and spent
From witch doctor to shaman, Kachina doll to chief
The spirit knows what ails you, you beg for its relief
All that I know, all that I say, my heart beats and my pulse drums
Out tribal rhythms pounding through the sky
The slayer's arrived 
On the black horse of steel 
Trouble is coming 
Hell on two wheels 
Hide in the shadows 
Awaiting defeat 
Or live by the sword 
And choose to be free 
We say retribution 
We say vengeance is bliss 
We say revolution 
With a cast iron fist 
Coming down the road 
Watching every move 
Kicking in the doors 
Taking what we choose 
Anarchy's coming to town 
A fiery invader 
Burning it down to the ground 
The Disintegrators 
Anarchy's coming 
Here it comes 
Burning it down to the ground 
The Disintegrators
The doctor is calling
The doctor is calling
Something's gone wrong
Nowhere do I belong
I listen to the voices in the dark room
Something's going down
But I can't make a sound
Looking past the bars of my mind
The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling

Always sharing trips
Remove me from your lips
Sight and mind still and never go away
One too many tantrums
Deviated symptoms
Better lock the phantom away
The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling
I see the chalk line crawling
I hear the doctor calling me away

This place is my home
My mind still runs free
The doctor's prescription
Less for you and more for me

The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling
I see the chalk line crawling
I hear the doctor calling
A merciful embalming
I hear, I hear, I hear the doctor calling me away
Come here
Closer
Who do you
Who do you think you are?
Some kind of super star?
We'll see
Where do you?
Where do you think you are?
That shit won't get you far
With me
You're just so dashing
You marvel at the sound
Of your own voice, as you crash into the ground
You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no robes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes
Just so you know
That's how it goes
You're bad
You're bad for my health
Because you make me sick
You prick
Don't you know?
Don't you know who I am?
You know I'd like your face
To kick
If your lips are moving I know you must be lying
You even suck the life out of dying
You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no robes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes
The house of cards are falling
Luck is running thin
Father forgive him, being a punk is not a sin
You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no robes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes
You look so perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
You look so perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect
And everybody knows
Except you
Such a pretty face
Radiant, I saw you across the room
I knew I had to have you
Thus started the chase
I knew I would do anything to take your hand and make you mine
But I learned long ago
If you love someone you have to let it go
Let it go, Let it go
The hardest part of letting go is saying
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye
Feathered away in a makeshift cell
Beneath the venomous moonlight
I unleash my plan to watch you fail
The one I am so ?
Go to sleep my love
And taste my sweet revenge upon your lips
Sealed with a kiss
I return to the masquerade ball
And hear the news of your weeping
Stone by stone imbued in the wall
Forever left for safekeeping
Go to sleep my love
And taste my sweet revenge upon your lips
Sealed with a kiss
But I learned long ago
If you love someone you have to let it go
Let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go is saying
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye
(Goodbye)
(Let it go)
Again we stalk the stage 
At mach speed we engage 
Feeding people's rage 
The big cat's left its cage 
Back in the bus again 
To catch another plane 
This behavior's quite insane 
But we do it for the fame, yeah 
I lost my mind, I lost all my money 
I lost my life to the Killing Road 
The road will never end 
It always starts again 
Another show's around the best 
Another long lost friend 
Faceless as the snow 
There's nothing special about the road 
It's just another haul 
It's just too damn long that's all, yeah
I barely get to the graveyard shift on time
After pulling another grueling 9 to 5
I live from credit card to check
The paper money's whirling by
And I hardly just
Just barely only just survive
I'm living on the edge
Reality is teetering
My mind is on the brink
How will I face the day tomorrow
If I can't make it through today
I've got nothing left to lose but my sanity
And the right to go insane
I've got nothing left to lose but my mind
I've got nothing left to choose
So I think I'll go insane
My stomach aches
Insufficient funds
My cheeks are gaunt
And my guts are overdrawn
My head pounds
Starvation's giving me the shakes
Too much squalor
Too much pressure
Now I'm getting pissed
I'm living on the edge
Reality is teetering
My mind is on the brink
How will I face the day tomorrow
If I can't make it through today
I've got nothing left to lose but my sanity
And the right to go insane
I've got nothing left to lose but my mind
I've got nothing left to choose
So I think I'll go insane
My life is everything
That feeds my thirst that causes sin
My wants are all I care
No shame and guilt, there's nothing there
Look deep into my face
I sell deceit without a trace
Fear not what I can do
Unless you want it done to you, oh oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh

My self I'm centered in
There's nothing else, there's never been
And I dream, to be left alone
With the sadness, the madness of my own
Look deep into my soul
It's black as coal like a bullet hole
Fear not, get off your knees

There's no defense, you'll do what I please, oh-oh!
As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh
As I climb onto your back, I promise not to sting
I tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
I will treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
'Cause you knew all along I am a scorpion, ya!

My lies, to reach the shore
I aggrandize and nothing more
My hopes, to steal away
All that you love, I'll soon betray
Look deep into my past
The pain I deal is unsurpassed
I'm not a lowly scorpion
I'm so much worse; I'm the fall of man
Mean and infectious
The evil prophets rise
Dance of the macabre
As witches streak the sky

Decadent worship of
Black magic and sorcery
In the womb of the Devils dungeon
Trapped without a plea

See thing in agony
Necrosis is the fate
Pins sticking through the skin
The venom now sedates

Locked in a pillory
Nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life
But no one hears a sound

Help me

Prepare the patients scalp
To peel away
Metal caps for his ears
He'll hear not what we say

Solid steel visor
Riveted cross his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws
So no one hears his cries

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin

Now you're drawn and quartered
Your bones will make the X
Symbol stands for poison
And it's chained to your head

And as we fold your arms
To make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix
Religion has been lost

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin

The skull beneath the skin
Justified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah part mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made have covered us
Where leprosy touch their flesh
Fall back with meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real
Seen the bird as a machism
A crest fallen nation see
Violent conditioning, cause the nature of the enemy
You're terminal lack of vision
Blinded, I see no light
A quiet lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive
A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real
Justified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah part mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made have covered us
Where leprosy touch their flesh
Fall back with meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real
A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real
An Iron fist quietly sits inside the Velvet Glove
Take control, untouchable just like God above
I can't escape, wrapped in red tape, what will become of me?
If I object, then I defect my country 'tis of thee

The White House is calling
Tell them I'll call them back
Just tell them anything
Yeah get them off my back

(The world needs a hero)

Not that I would ever lie but I have no choice
Words I say heard today are not mine, just my voice

NATO is on line 1
They want to talk to me
Tell them that I'm not in
Tell them that I'm not free

The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero

Phantom rule, the hidden jewel who's really in control?
On puppet strings, a nation swings undermined by moles

The UN is on hold
Tell them I'll call them back
Yeah tell them anything
Just get them off my back

The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero

Dave the White House is calling
They want to talk to me
Tell them that I can't be bought
Tell them that I'm not free

The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero
The world needs a hero
Got to, got to, got to find a hero
The world needs a hero
You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love, but I call sex
You've been kissing when you ought-a-be-a
Screwing and now someone else can
Kiss your ass
These boots are made for walking
that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you 
You keep lying and there ain't no believing
And you keep stayin' when you ought-a-be-a leaving
Now what's right is right but you ain't been 
Right yet
These boots
You keep dressin' ways you shouldn't
Be dressing
And you keep thinking that you'll never
Get burned ha!
I just found me a brand new Box Spring
Mattress
What you know bitch you got a lot ta learn
These boots, are you ready boots
And you think I'm kiddin', don'tchya!
For this I was chosen
Because I fear nothing
With confidence I tread through the dead of night
Off to another war-torn faraway battlefields
Wherein lies a demonic enemy horde

On this day I decide to anoint my fist
Engaging them in the mode of power and war

Stopping at nothing just short of fulfilling my destiny
Willing to die in my will after you for what I believe

A despair? of men striking fear in their hearts
Invading their dreams before the day even starts

Wet with your blood I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow I may lay down and die
But not this day!

Sent on an unholy quest
To reduce all those who resist
? souls
?

Vanquish the strangle horse? that the netherworld sent for me
The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies

Bathed in blood up to my horses bridle
It's death to retreat there's no chance of survival

Wet with your blood I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow I may lay down and die
But not this day

This day we fight!

Stripped of fallen heroes
? are wounded
Collect the spoils of war
And send them the dead

This day we fight!
It was just another day
It was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right
There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can do
Lying on your bed, examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch, I throw the switch
Somewhere the electric chair awaits

Hey! this was my life
Hey! this was my fate

This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin
Now there's motives for the suspect
Now there's nothing left to say
Now there's method to the madness
Now there's society to pay

Lying on your bed, examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch, I throw the switch
Somewhere the electric chair awaits

Hey! this was my life
Hey! this was my fate

In our life there's if
In our beliefs there's lie
In our business there's sin
In our bodies there's die
This was my life
This was my fate

This was my life
This was my fate
Father time, I'm running late
I'm winding down, I'm growing tired
Seconds drift into the night
The clock just ticks till my time expires

You were once my friend
Now I know I can't tie your hands
The days I saved I couldn't spend
They fell like sand through the hourglass
No time to lose, no time to choose

Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one
Not even me

An enemy I can't defend
My final place a deadly end
Life's just a speck in space
Dreams of an eternal resting place

I can't get any younger
Time has brutal hunger

Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one, waits for no one
Not even me
This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up,I wanted to cry
But dammit,this well's gone dry
Not for the money,not for the fame
Not for the power,just no more games
But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies,that let a 1000 days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado,blow me away
You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years,not from the use
Not from the tears,just self abuse
Who's to say,what's for me to say...be...do
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me
The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light
Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep,I really feel
I warn you of the fate
Proven true to late
Your tongue twist perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death
I'm doing you a favor
As I'm taking all your money
I guess I should feel sorry
But I don't even trust me
There's bad news creeping up
And you feel a sudden chill
How do you do? my name is trouble
I'm coming in for the kill

I'm in for the kill
And you know I will
Set the ball a-rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the Train of Consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The Train of Consequences
There ain't no turning back

No horse ever ran as fast
As the money that you bet
I'm blowing on my cards
And I play them to my chest
Life's fabric is corrupt
Shot through with corroded thread
As for me I hocked my brains
Packed my bags and headed West

I hocked my brains
headed West
Set the ball a-rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the Train of Consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The Train of Consequences
There ain't no turning back

Set the ball a-rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the Train of Consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The Train of Consequences
There ain't no turning back

Set the ball a-rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the Train of Consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The Train of Consequences
There ain't no turning back
Lost in a dream
Nothing is what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
Time and again
She repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes
Another truth bends,
I must confess
I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again
But I wish I could trust
My body aches of mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
How could this be happening to me
I'm lying when I say, "Trust me"
I can't believe this is true
Trust hurts
Why does trust equal suffering
Absolutely nothing we trust
Within striking distance from Ground Zero sits a smoldering international cauldron
The United "Abominations" as it were
Forged to prevent wars and froze in the face of disaster
And stood silent while terrorization took hostage of the world
In a mire of hypocrisy, the UN ignored sex crimes by its blue helmets
And enables terrorism, so, in the end, it's failed
And the UN is where our so-called friends get to stab us in the back
And we pay twenty-two percent of their tab to host our enemies here at home
Ambassadors from countries otherwise known as a catastrophe
Enjoy diplomatic immunity living in Manhattan 
While their children are turned into prostitutes
It's a complete and utter disgrace, a blot on the face of humanity
And they get away with it
Poverty in their kitchens
Held hostage by oil-for-food
Yet their own plates are full of the fat of their lands
There's no blood on their hands, right Ko-Jo?
They promised to tell the truth
Without leaving a fingerprint
They will lose the U.N. one way or another
The victim, I fear, will be us, sisters and brothers
The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now; the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations
A grave and gathering danger
The decision to attack
Based on secret intelligence; it'll take years
I fear to undo the failings in Iraq
You may bury the bodies
But you can't bury the crimes 
Only fools stand up and really lay down their arms
No, not me - not when death lasts forever
The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now; the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time...
The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now; the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now; the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations
NATO invaded Yugoslavia to end ethnic cleansing, there was no U.N.
The U.S. invaded Afghanistan after 9/11, there was no U.N.
Saddam Hussein violated seventeen U.N. resolutions
The U.N. was asked to join the war in Iraq
The U.S. invaded, there was no U.N.
Libya bombed a discotheque in Berlin killing Americans, there was no U.N.
And Iran funds Hamas and attacked the U.S. in the seventies, there was no U.N.
Facing war without end, looking into the future, there was no more U.N.
I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man
Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man
Cryptic writings on the wall, the beginning of the end
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in my hand
Now, one day I started telling everyone that "Killing Is My Business..."
And I was hung like a martyr
For "Looking Down the Cross" my "Skull Beneath the Skin"
Prophesied "Last Rites/Loved to Death" my friends
Then I started seeing "Bad Omens" in my head
"Good Mourning/Black Friday," will I "Wake Up Dead"?
If "I Ain't Superstitious" then this won't mean a thing
But some crazy shit has happened since "The Conjuring"
Not even close... To overdose!
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Came "Anarchy" to "Set the World Afire"
Pain of "Hook in Mouth," "In My Darkest Hour"
Corruption of the world, "Peace Sells... But Nobody's Buying"
Ignorant religion, "Holy Wars" and the dying
"Tornado" nearly got me by the "Skin O'My Teeth"
"This Was My Life," "Foreclosure of My Dreams"
May the past "Rust in Peace" in "Hangar 18"
And "Countdown to Extinction" just be a bad dream
"Lucretia" said...
Locked in battle hardened
Deep despair and doubt
A gaggle of grenades with
All the pins pulled out
A dog bit my hand, I'm crawling on the ground
Asking for some help, but no one ever comes
Walking in a nightmare, please turn on the light
I hear the strangest sounds, can anyone hear them?
I hear them
Hit my head on the wall, 'til my keepers come
Protect me from myself, off to the quiet room
Weird specters ride the air, I know I can't be wrong
I see and hear them too, can anyone else hear them?
Internal combustion 
Multiple personalities 
Terror inside of me 
A mask of silent agony 
Curse the falling rain 
The vortex of pain 
As medieval as Merlin 
A pact for power was made 
Lucifer in transition 
It's time the price was paid 
Scorching the domain 
The vortex of pain 
A telestic message 
Written in torment 
Howl out dirges 
Like the horns of Jericho 
Distorted faces 
Writhing in rage 
Walls of purgatory 
Tumble down 
Endless death 
The jewels of a crown
I sneak in my own house
It's four in the morning
I had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed,
I know if I wake her,
I'll wake up dead
[Chorus]
I wonder, will she find out,
About the other, other lover.
Diana.
Wake up dead, you die
Wake up dead, and buried.
Wake up dead, you die
Wake up dead.
I sneak in my own house
It's four in the morning
I've had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed
I know if I wake her
I'll wake up dead
I wonder, will she find out?
About the other, other lover...
Diana
Wake up dead, you die
Wake up dead, and buried
Wake up dead, you die
Wake up dead
As sure as the sun rises in the east
Another gunman will come seeking my defeat
Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still
Will he fall like all the rest ending his days upon boothill
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone

As I ride into the sunset to take another town
Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down
The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns
Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone

A drum beats for me, it's louder every day
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet
My judgment day,  my judgment day
My judgment day,  my judgment day
My judgment day,  my judgment day
My judgment day,  my judgment day
My judgment day,  my judgment day
My judgment day,  my judgment day
My judgment day,  my judgment day

A drum beats for me, it's louder every day
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgment day
Life's an endless showdown never knowing when they'll come
I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun
My smoking gun
The game I play has caused a lot of grief
They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land
I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land
I got wanderlust
The quiet war has begun with silent weapons
And the new slavery is to keep the people
Poor and stupid; "Novus Ordo Seclorum"
How can there be any logic in biological war?
We all know this is wrong, but the New World Order's
Beating down the door
Oh, something needs to be done
There was a king (an evil king), who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery no prophet could interpret
Of seven years of famine; the wolf is at my door
As predicted years ago: that that was, that is, that is no more
The word predicts the future and tells the truth about the past
Of how the world leaders will hail the new Pharaoh
The eighth false king to the throne
Washington is next!
Disengage their minds, sabotage their health
Promote sex, and war, and violence in the kindergartens
Blame the parents and teachers; it's their fault; "Annuit Coeptis"
Attack the church dynamic, attack the family
Keep the public undisciplined till nothing left is sacred, and
The "have-nots" get hooked and have to go to the "haves" just to cop a fix
I am the king (an evil king), who dreams the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, nobody could interpret
Of seven empires falling; the wolf is at my door
As predicted years ago: that that was, that is, that is no more
The word predicts my future and tells the truth about my past
Of how the world's leaders are waiting to usher in
The eighth world power of modern Rome
Washington is next!
There was a king (an evil king), who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret
Of seven empires falling; the wolf is at my door
As predicted years ago: that that was, that is, that is no more
I am a king, and I dream the wildest dreams
And nobody could interpret
Seven empires falling; the wolf is at my door
Oh, that that was, that is, that is no more
There's something at my door, some ancient mystery
The future tells the truth about the past
And I'm the eighth false king to the throne
I've got you in my cross hairs; now, ain't that a bitch?
Washington, you're next!
Secret bureaucracy, it's just a lie
The devil's henchmen, in suit and tie
A sacred brotherhood, an ancient rite
Politicians and the double lives they hide
Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your social security
We the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die
Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves
The land of liberty needs a regime change
Until you no longer know right from wrong
The constitution isn't worth the paper it's written on
Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your social security
We the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die
In revolution we die
Screams from the future, warn of calamity
The coming plagues of the new disease
The illuminati, one world currency
One world religion, one world everything
Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your social security
We the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die
We the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die
We the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die
No hears a word I say 
And my prayers are never answered 
But you'll never see the pain inside of me 
Stabbing me over and over and over 
I trusted you and I loved you 
And you spit back in my face 
How could you do this to me? 
When will you stop trying to hurt me? 
I've walked a minefield for you 
A career in hell with you 
I have made it through the things 
Others would surely die just watching 
And the oath I take on this day 
Is to know that you will be repaid 
One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl 
Until then, until I see your world implode 
I wish you death and suffering 
Misery to spare 
Time to release your pain 
Face the last enemy 
I am the last thing you will know 
The last thing you will see 
I see your death surrounding me 
I know you, yes I do 
I know you 
When no words are spoken and please are ignored 
Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough? 
When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard 
The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough? 
It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies 
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life 
When judgement has failed you 
When your own heart's impaled you 
Your wandering mind has destroyed you 
Will you ever know when? 
When you give everything and the feeling is gone 
All the giving is fake, did you fake enough? 
When you take everything and you stay too long 
When there's nothing left, did you take enough? 
It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies 
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life 
When judgment has failed you 
When your own heart's impaled you 
Your wandering mind has destroyed you 
Will you ever know when?
Ooh, you're just in time
To get inside my head
Ooh, the war of words
You're underneath my skin
You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows
You think you know what's best for me
You hate everything you've seen in me
Have you looked in a mirror?
Hey! just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey! just whose life is this anyway?
Costs so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay!
You only point out faults
Anxiety attack!
You running your mouth
You stab me in the back!
You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows
You think you know what's best for me
You hated everything you've seen in me
Have you looked in a mirror?
Hey! just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey! just whose life is this anyway?
Costs so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay!
(Running your mouth)
(Running your mouth)
Stab me in the back
Anxiety attack
Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?
Costs so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay!
Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?
Just whose life is this anyway?
Just whose life is this anyway?
It doesn't matter what car you drive, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter where you sleep at night, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter where you go to work
Doesn't matter where you go to church
Doesn't matter just how bad it hurts, she'll wreck it
My bleached bones in the desert, it's all she's left of me
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wrecker
It doesn't matter what you pretend, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter what you defend, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter how you live your life
Doesn't matter anymore to your wife
Doesn't matter even how you die, she'll wreck that too
Like a vulture picking my bones clean, it's all that's left of me
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wrecker
Doesn't matter where you live
Doesn't matter what you drive
Home wrecker
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wrecker
When someone becomes nothing to anyone
Whilst feelings have died
Anyone would know it
They set out stick and stones
They say they'd crush my bones
I say, I don't get mad, I get even
Before they do
Spoils go to the victor
I'm dead on time
Your time is going to come
[Chorus]
One day I'll dance on your graves
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "you're dead to me"
We're all just trying to hold on to anything
You'd think they'd know that's what we're trying to do
These wounds are invisible
Underneath the dirt I still see the scars
But then when things got bad, we spread our wings and fly away
You'll take all of your riches in the back of a hearse
Your time is going to come
[Chorus]
One day I'll dance on your graves
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
[Chorus]
Who'd believe with the way things are here
We'd be going anywhere telling people how to live?
Who's believe we'd spend more shippin' drugs and guns
Than to educate our sons? Sorry but that's what they did
I can't help but think,
Someone's forsaken you and me
Luck deserted me and the truth beat out my brains
Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things
I've stepped over many bodies on my way
Thanks for the information don't need no more anything
We are the damned of all the world with sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars, we've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway and now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives, we run for Youthanasia
Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied
So as you read this, know, my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all
[Chorus]
A tout le monde
A tout mes amis
Je vous aime
Je dois partir
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living are scarred
[Chorus]
(So as you read this, know, my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone, that's all)
[Chorus x 2]
(These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free)
Grinding my teeth, white knuckles grasp at the wheel
I rush from an avalanche of adrenaline, it's all that I feel
As quick as a bolt of lightning, a rocket ride in a bucket seat
It doesn't get any better than this, it just feeds my need for speed
Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spiting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame throwing fury
8, 000 horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And it's 1, 320' to go to the finish line
My hands hold tight, a fire breathing stampede
I fall into a trance, hold my breath till the light turns green
In a cloud of nitro methane, melting rubber, I say my prayers
Man and machine accelerate and I vanish in thin air
Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spiting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame throwing fury
8, 000 horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And it's 1, 320' to go to the finish line
The tides of change pulled us apart
I feel a familiar pain
It seems like years since we've loved
Or even liked and that's a lonely way to be

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I will never take you back

You know what? It's over
I just don't feel the same way as I used to
We've been together forever, but it's over

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

It seems nothing good is free
A good thing cost much more than the price
You were good but not that good
Don't kid yourself now it's time to beak up

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I'll never take you back

Don't call me anymore
It's just not
I don't feel the same way about you
Its not as good as it used to be

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

I'll always love you but just not like that
Like what?
I want to be honest with you I met someone else
You did what?
And I really, I really love him like I used to love you
Remember the time that I told you that
I was going out of town for business?
Well I went to see him
You know what? you suck

Goodbye 1000 times
You'll always have a special place
In my heart you know that
It's just I can't be with you anymore it's over
Goodbye 1000 times
Things may not work out with him
Goodbye 1000 times
And if they don't
Goodbye 1000 times
Then I'll certainly call you
Goodbye 1000 times
You mean a lot to me
I still really want to be friends with you
I love you like you're my brother
Thirteen times I went to the well
To draw my thoughts, I'll gather and tell
Like bricks that I've laid to build my life
Those that crumbled only caused me strife

Thoughts became words, cast into the sea
But they returned, always haunting me
Like a severed arm washed up on the shore
I just don't think I can give anymore

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

At thirteen I started down this path
Fueled with anger, music was my wrath
Years of clawing at scars that never healed
Drowning my mind, the thoughts are too real

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

I can't get out, I can't jump out
Too much to face, I can't erase

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

I can't get out, I can't jump out
Too much to face, I can't erase

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
It was a cool winter's morning
Somewhere shortly past 9:00 AM
The armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming
So instead they went for the bank

The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car
Heavily sedated with thousands of round
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground

Baptized in a firefight
Hot blood running cold as ice
Forty four minutes of target practice
All hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force" come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast!!!

This was an accident waiting to happen
It wasn't if it would happen, it was when
The city's people sabotaged themselves
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense

The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped
Standard police issue guns were just not enough
But SWAT arrived to settled the fight
Between AK-47 and AR-15

Baptized in a firefight
Hot blood running cold as ice
Forty four minutes of target practice
All hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force" come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast!!!

Baptized in a firefight
Hot blood running cold as ice
Forty four minutes of target practice
All hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force" come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast!!!
"Pull over, shithead, this is the cops!" 
Full tank, pockets lined with cash 
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass. 
Drive all day and through the night, 
Romance the road, winding left to right. 
The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free. 
A feeling inside me and the whole world to see. 
Driving fast makes me feel good, 
The speed of light trapped under my hood. 
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do. 
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502. 
Hundreds of miles rolled off today. 
Signs lose their meanings, minutes tick away. 
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all. 
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol. 
Drive until daybreak, always on the go. 
Life on the freeway, night shift 'til dawn patrol. 
Driving fast makes me feel good, 
The speed of light trapped under my hood. 
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do. 
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502. 
Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you. 
Stars above guide me 
This feeling inside me 
I drive until daybreak. 
Life on the freeway is Hell. 
I'm coming through
If I see the morning hours
I'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow
'Cause I've burned out my today

If I get up to the top I know
I'll just go back downhill
Gotta' terminal future
And it's time to write my will

Down another glass of courage
And a shot of Thorazine

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Gotta' short between the earphones
Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave

Ain't got no last words to say
Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind

In a black tie and straight jacket
Man I'm gonna try again

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Demitasse of arsenic
Try on this tie
Never mind the tree

There is only death and danger
In the sockets of my eyes
A playground of illusion
No one plays they only die

There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break
I'm as mad as a hatter
And strung out just the same

Taunting rigor mortis
I feel it draw me in
I am the author, dream up your pain
Drink as did Bacchus, rebel just like Cain
Lord of the city, I shall remain
All pandemonium, I shall reign
Sit in my fortress, up on my hill
Drinking the wine, 'til I've had my fill
Building up high, my castle walls
Oh, to veil my splendid fall
I present you, I present to you,
I present you this crown of worms
Surrounding myself with mysery
Drawn curtains heavy of my history
Exquisite I am, perfect unity
On my left hand is false majesty
I feign affection, refute the true story
Dispute with creation, the lie is my glory
I care for no one, my gospel is death
For me the light's gone, only darkness is left
I present you, I present to you,
I present you this crown of worms
As black in deed, as cold as stone
A commandment of one, as proud as gold
As neglected in spirit, as time is old
As legion is numbers, as legend is told
I am alone, with the agony of truth
My power of will, my judgment and chain
My end is knowledge and conscience of guilt,
My final confusion hidden from me till I'm done
There's a secret place I like to go 
Everyone is there but their face don't show 
If you get inside you can't get out 
There's no coming back, I hear them shout 
Welcome to my hide away, my secret place 
How I arrived I can't explain 
You're welcome to, if you want to stay 
But everyone just runs away 
Let me in, get me out 
Can't do more than twist and shout 
Lost my soul without a trace 
Found it again in my secret place 
In disgrace 
I hide from those that try to find me 
Scary things that's right behind me 
I lost myself, I must confess 
I can't explain how I got this mess
Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans tonight
So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone that's all
A tous le monde
A tous les amis
Je vous aime
Je dois partir
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living are scarred
Only yesterday they told me you were gone
All these normal people, will I find another one?
Monkey on my back, aching in my bones
I forgot you said one day you'll walk alone
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head!

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted, addicted to chaos

Light shined on my path
Turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks,
I smashed 'em 'cause I could
My brain was labored, my head would spin
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in
The rain comes down, cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown
Remember that you said
One day you'll walk alone

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted to chaos

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

In a dream I cannot see (in a dream I cannot see)
Tangled abstract fallacy (tangled abstract fallacy)
Random turmoil builds in me (random turmoil builds in me)
Bills bills bills
In a dream I cannot see (in a dream I cannot see)
Tangled abstract fallacy (tangled abstract fallacy)
Random turmoil builds in me (random turmoil builds in me)
I'm addicted, addicted to the chaos
Addicted, addicted, to chaos, chaos
Addicted to chaos, chaos
I lied just a little 
When I said I need you 
You stretched the truth 
When you said that you knew 
Just can't believe it 
There's nothing to say 
I was almost honest, almost 
Living alone, can't stand this place 
It's four in the morning and I still see your face 
I was nearly pure 
When I said I loved you 
You were semi-sincere 
You said I'd bleed for you 
We were kind of candid 
Now you've gone away 
You were almost honest, almost 
Living alone, falling from grace 
I want to atone but there's just empty space 
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back 
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks 
I question your call by the tone of your voice 
I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice 
It happened that night when you told me to go 
Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know 
Almost, almost honest 
Almost, I was almost honest
Recruiting the ill-fated for "The War"
A legion of uneducated, bankrupt souls
With a lust for revenge, answering the call
From New Yorqatar to Califarabia

Desperation provides fertile ground for religious extremism
This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
Like a crouching tiger
Tormenting peasants till they erect an army
Under everyone's nose
In the end propaganda destroys their DNA
God help them

All that they envisioned of what things would come to be
Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God; the undoing of man

Promising a vapor,in the end they become one

No rules of engagement,this enemy hides
Amongst women and children

And to beat violence,you must ignore the focus groups
You must send in the Mossad, turn of the BBC, CNN
And don't look back
Rest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis, hell!
There'll be no more Middle East!
These are your people Lady Liberty
Pull up your dress today
And tattooed is "Property of the USA
A subsidiary of Halliburton"
Surprise?
But a roaring lion is about to be unleashed on earth
Hey, Jihad Joe?
Guess what?
We're coming to get you!

All that you envisioned of what things will come to be
Turns into a death knell when you look behind the scenes
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God; the undoing of man
Right now
I am an anti-Christ
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want, but I know how get it
I want to destroy, possibly?
'Cause I want to be anarchy, no dog's body
Anarchy for the U.S.A.
It's coming sometime, it may be
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light
Your future dream is a shopping spree
'Cause I want to be anarchy, in the city
Of many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy
I use anarchy
'Cause I want to be anarchy, it's the only way to be
Is this the M.P.L.A.?
Is this the U.D.A.?
Is this the I.R.A.?
I thought it was the U.S.A., or just another country
And other cunt-like tendencies
'Cause I want to be anarchy, 'cause I want to be
Anarchy, you know what I mean?
'Cause I want to be anarchist, again I'm pissed
Destroy!
The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry owe!
And when the story takes a twist
If folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry
The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face
Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture it's jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again
And again and again, again
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry owe!
Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy
Hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost
The spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw, blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression

Praise your architecture of aggression
Ensuing power vacuum
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire
And the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face a kiss
The other genocide
Time to pay with your ass
A worldwide suicide

Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw, blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression

People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall

Melting down all metals, turning plows and shears to swords
Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war
Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy

Now we've rewritten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy

If you're fighting to live
It's okay to die
The answer to your question is
Welcome to tomorrow

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy
Where were you when it happened?
Where could you be found?
Were you at the front of the stage?
Or in the underground
From SF out to Old Bridge
NY back to LA
The world of metal changed forever
Back in the day
Well that was back in the day
And if you weren't there
It doesn't matter anyway
Because you wouldn't understand
Live to die and die to play
Every day and place
Leave a path of metal 
Across the world from stage to stage
Well that was back in the day
And if you weren't there
It doesn't matter anyway
Because you wouldn't understand
In denim and leather
We were all part of one force
Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass
And put metal on the course
Higher!
Higher!
Higher!
Higher!
Back in the day
You weren't there
It doesn't mater 
Because you wouldn't understand
This is our way of life
A life that was born free
To follow orders how to live
Was never meant to be
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting
The power hits the stage
The music was exciting
The mania raged
On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
We all had the fever
Our ears started to ring
Feeding this wildfire
Consuming everything
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Metal's King back then
And still is this today
Others imitate or challenge
But it never goes away
On, oh-oh, oh-oh
Down fell the stars and they splashed in the sea.
"Mi nomine baphomet," come dance with me.
Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites.
Their master has come, the moon is full tonight.
Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast.
The Devil, who's watching, with demons remote.
Fire, rising, racing in your blood.
Possessed, naive, his service is done.
Bloody blasphemy
Sinister's the word as the demons take their fill.
An orgy's taking place, human blood will spill.
And act of worship as they conceive the ghouls.
Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes.
The ceremony is sure to be cursed.
They wait for his blessing but down comes the worst.
Their bodies, soulless, a corpse from the grave.
Their minds are helpless and no one can save them,
No one can save them.
Hey... look around you
Everything's helter-skelter
Listen up... I warn you
Run for cover, run
Bang... it happened
Time's up, Armageddon
Fire... meltdown
The sky is crumbling in
Black curtains... never ending
Escape... you're joking
Can't find no place to run
Hair... is burning
My flesh is bubbling up
Blood... is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue
Fate... is coming
Welcome it with a smile
Black curtains... never ending, fall
Something's under my skin
Something's very strange
Playing with my mind
Tempting me to do you in
Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom in a spider's web
Suffocating, no one hears my calls
Never ending, till the black curtain falls
Snakes... surround me
Offering their death kiss to me
Down... I'm drowning
How long, I hold my breath
Dogs... are chasing
My legs are paralyzed
Pray... don't find me
My life is fading fast
This is breaking news
It appears that Air Force One was shot down
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists, firing a Stinger Missile
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for
The President's whereabouts are presently unknown
And he is presumed missing

The Vice President, Secretary of State,
And principals of the military are assembling
Our nation stands at Defcon 3
The greatest crisis, will someone come for me?
I "red, white and blew it"
Unleashed revenge, my body is detained
How could anybody do this?

Betrayal, I peel away the days
Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me
I'm not important, no one will ever come
I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell
Nuclear battlefields energized
Cold wars are heating up again
The tensions mounting

People lift up your fists in revenge
The stage is set
Who will be the first to blink?
We can't go to war
Remember that "Vietnam thing"
Peace at any price
With a gun to your head, bang, bang

Weakness runs in your family
What runs in mine is death
This is your 5 minute warning
Burn all your classified documents
And if cooler heads don't prevail
First strike from a political dead man
Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive
He understands only one language, action!
And he respects only one word, force!
No sign of them stopping,
No time for back channel communiques
We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions!
Retaliate, I say!

The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war
Blackmail the Universe with the greatest of calamities
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground
With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence
Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours
Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means
And in hatred you see men as they really are
If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them
All along, only another region of hell
The great silent mirror
Under the stars and the moon
Sounds of galloping horses
On clouds of lightning and thunder
A dark and gathering storm
To scorch the earth for many generations
A new winter, worse than any
Called the holy war
A white horse on the clouds of death
A red war horse to end all wars
A pale horse in pastilets led by
A black horse with famine at his gails
The doctrine of hatred
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood and let me be
The first born of the dead
A crown rider with arrows and bow
A rare rider with a great fiery sword
Lakes come from the one called death
Horror and Apocalypse follows
Moons two full horsemen ride again
Their fathers kingdom spun to kingdom come
I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name stone
Blessed are the dead
A white horse on the bowels of death
A red war horse to end all wars
A pale horse in pastilets led by
A black horse with famine at his gails
The synagogue of Satan
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood, and let me be
The first born of the dead
A crown rider with arrows and bow
A rare rider with a great fiery sword
Lakes come from the one called death
Horror and Apocalypse follows
Moons two full horsemen ride again
Their fathers kingdom spun to kingdom come
I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name stone
Blessed are the dead
Walking stiff let me tall ya' 
Better left for dead 
And now we are on a mission 
Well it's full speed ahead 
My legion's when we do the crime 
Let's get one thing straight 
To get there early is on time 
And showing up on time is late 
Ladies and gents, we're still alive 
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time 
Angel in our pocket, devil by our side 
We ain't going nowhere, 'cuz heroes never die 
Still alive 
Blood of heroes 
Never die 
They never die 
We've been run down every hill 
Chased up all the dead end streets 
But if you try to cut us out 
You'll get a kick in the teeth 
Ladies and Gents, we're still alive 
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time 
Fasten up you head belts, 
Time to ride the skies 
It's time to be immortal, 'cuz heroes never die
Ain't got no job
Ain't got no smoke
Ain't got a car
His life's a joke
Living on the skids
Thinks the world's just fine
Forgot what he did
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline
Forgot who he is
Forgot who he was
Used to call the shots
Now he can't connect the dots
A mover and shaker
Getting closer to his maker
Lower than a hemline
Dancing on the breadline
No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline

Watch him dance

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline
No one, nothing, nowhere
The breadline dancing on the breadline
Dancing on the breadline
He forgot and he ain't got nothing
Make up the rules for me to live by 
Rules you break and just let it slide 
You try and find you inside of me 
Be as great as you want me to be 
Hypocrite, the word that fits 
Do as you say 
Not as you do 
You're pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint 
Self esteem you seem to lack 
Point the finger 
There's three pointing back 
Control's the illusion with all good intent 
Bad times are contagious 
You laugh and infect 
Criticist, the word that fits 
Put me down to lift you up 
Watching pain's your only pleasure 
Fascination for sick disaster 
Suffering since you were born 
Mess with the bull and you get the horns. 
Misery, the word that fits 
Times are good when times are bad 
"In my opinion as a professional I recommend we straight-jacket the son of a 
bitch, lock him in a rubber room, sedate him, heavily, and when he wakes up, if 
he wakes up, we'll see if he can be a nice boy" 
"Well... I don't know... It's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt him" 
"Let's do it!" 
"Sedate me? Cool! a straight jacket? Hey, hey, let go of me!" 
You push me to a breakpoint 
Push me to a breakpoint 
Push me to a breakpoint 
Don't push me, you piece of shit!
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Listen, I didn't start this believe me, I will finish it
You called down the thunder too late now there's no way out
Nothing is gonna stop me until then better watch your back
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
There is no retreating I will cut you down to size
You will beg for mercy a bad seed, you're as good as dead
Yield to new dimension Hell's coming, better say your prayers
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?
One day you will face me and see the terror trapped inside
Final retribution torture and pure punishment
Vengeance running so deep a dungeon of agony awaits
Fear not as death surrounds you 
Bitch all you want, but here it comes
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?
No one knows what draws the moth to the flame
And nothing costs as much as playing the game
She had to know, know, know, he'd give love for sex
He had to know, know, know, she'd give sex for love
The taste, touching his tongue, sweet to his lips
Poison, now penetrating deeper
Betrayed by just one bite, for just one night
To find forbidden fruit tastes sweeter
Just like pressing a loaded gun to your head
One knows only the spider can navigate its web
She had to know, know, know, he'd get what he wants
He had to know, know, know, she'd get what she needs
Soon under the spell, emotions are high
Mind control penetrating deeper
The hex was cast on him, all he believes
Now is forbidden fruit tastes sweeter
She had to know, know, know, he'd win at the start
He had to know, know, know, she'd win in the end
His one last thought blew his mind, bullet to the brain
Hot lead was penetrating deeper
Just one reckless shot squeezed from the hand
That knows forbidden fruit tastes sweeter
Pounding in my teeth
Hydraulics on the move
Kicking in my face
Savage bucking mule 
Pummeling my soul
100 tons of lead
Trampled under foot
Steamrollers on my head 
Crushing down, caving in my will to live
I'd rather be dead, scream insane
To have the bullprick split their guts
Make them pay make them bleed 
On your backs, in your face
Down your throats, up your ass
Bullprick! 
Pulverizing flesh, broken bones the aftermath
Can't escape the war, the war machine path
All become one, flattening the streets
Cry for absolution, splitting at the seams 
Crushing down, caving in my will to live
I'd rather be dead, scream insane
To have the bullprick split their guts
Make them pay make them bleed 
On your backs, in your face
Down your throats, up your ass
Bullprick! 
On your backs, in your face
Down your throats, up your ass
Bullprick!
I've got a sickening feeling
My life is standing still
It's clear that fate is closing in
But this is the life I choose
I've got so much time to kill
Born to lose, I'll die to win
Burn, baby burn, 'cause it feels so good
I'm getting on my own nerves
And I get no satisfaction
Till I light it up and I burn it down
One match lights my fire
And it starts a chain reaction
That burns my crooked past to the ground
Burn, baby burn, 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn ike I knew it would
Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire, my desire to burn
I hear the darkness call
The sirens are growing near
It's time I make my great escape
The flames are getting tall
Inside my rear view mirror
Just a spark is all it takes
Burn, baby burn, 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn like I knew it would
Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire
I've got the fire, burning desire
And it burns, yeah, baby it burns
It burns; yeah, it burns, hotter than hell
Sifting the damage done
I'm burning up all the proof
I won't be going down in flames
At large, I'm on the run
They're tightening up the noose
It's too late; I need to get away
Burn, baby burn, 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn like I knew it would
You give up on yourself
Somehow you got betrayed again
Thin ice and luck runs out
Who will you blame it on this time?

Due to lack of interest in you
At the light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

Don't close your eyes to injustice
Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit
A man without any valor
Has nothing worth living for

Due to lack of interest in you
At the light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time
He said he'd try just a little bit
He didn't want to end up like them
And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder
Pounding on the door to make the next score
Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it
For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul
Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell
He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell
Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies
His cause of death, high speed on burnt ice
Always looking at the ground, a broken, beaten man
Memories of his family are calling after him
He can hardly thing, hardly walk
Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk
With just one hit the pain would go away
But he's dead if he does
Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes
Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows
Madness comes, and madness goes
An insane place, with insane moves
Battles without, for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up, just breaking them in
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins
Never disclose, never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man, you're a murderer
Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all, oh you're a god

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have you honor
We find the defendant guilty on all counts for crimes
Against all humanity
By virtue of the jury's decision and the power vested in me by the state,
I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with no possibility of parole,
for life
Life? whale' ya' mean life? I ain't got a life!
Boy, your soul better belong to Jesus,'cause your ass belongs to me

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

No time for questions
No time for games
Start kicking ass
And taking down the names
A long shit list
A shorter fuse
He is untouchable
And guarantees you'll lose
Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Inside the bighouse
His nightmare unfolds
Before he got there
His manpussy was sold
Black blanket welcome
This tough guy's now a bitch
Praying for death
It can't be worse than this

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Captive honour, ain't no honour
You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For Deth surely wants you
With sharp and pointy teeth
An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen one
Human bones blanket the dirt
of the heathens lair
That we must pass this den of deth
The only path from here
But I walk in the light
The time to die has come
No one shall take my life
I'm of the chosen ones
Black shadows till the sky
As the creatures eyes grow near
Raise the shield of the holy pilgrims
High into the air
Heavens powers fill my arms
Onward now to fight I'm sent
Oh the beast is coming
To put you to the test 
Lookout!
Now this land is mine to pilage
Rape, and steal, and take at will
Never let you cross this path
I reign, for now, I say to Kill
I put my money in the suitcase
And headed for the big race
I felt a chill on my backbone
As I hung up the telephone
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat
They say chances on the outside
Are looking pretty slim
I've been so lucky on the inside
I feel I'm going to win
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat
I've got a whole month's wages
I haven't seen that much in ages
I might spend it in stages
And move out to Las Vegas
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat
I put my money in the suitcase
They say chances on the outside
I've got a whole month's wages
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Stone cold crazy, place another bet
And today, I leave you 
But I'll be back someday 
And as I fly away 
My hope is that we'll meet again 
I'm off to my home away from home 
I will miss you 
But I know 
I know you know 
I'm coming home to Arizona 
I'm coming home to Arizona 
I'll take you everywhere I go 
I'll show you everything I see 
And as we say so long 
I know your tears wish me well 
It won't be long till I'm back again 
We will meet again 
We will meet again 
You will see, oh 
I'm coming home to Arizona 
I'm coming home
Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
And ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair,
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man,
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt and take your turn
'Liars' anagram is lairs
Man you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
One hour from now
Another species of life form

Forever and the rate is accelerating
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
Enter the arena and hit the lights
Step up now you're in for a ride
This is war, ain't no fun and games

The stakes are rich, take a hit or stay
The price is high, someone's gonna pay

Heads I win, tails you lose

Looking for trouble, now you've found it

Crush, crush, crush, crush'em
Sentenced to work a dead end 9 to 5
Trapped in a dingy corporate cubicle hell
Then go to work in the darkness on the midnight shift
Any chance you get, selling gas at the corner Shell
Three letters groups listening in on you
Under surveillance courtesy of Big Brother in your car
Drones monitor each and every move you make
It doesn't matter who you know or who you think you are
You'll never see a ray of daylight
So far in debt you're struggling to survive
But you will break your back fighting and they'll help
Before you let them break your pride
"Powers that be" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready
You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun
Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come
Down on your luck, you had your hand out once or twice
But all you wanted was just a hand, they say
"You have the right to remain silent", so shut your mouth
Don't mention the broken promises and lies of hope and change
"Powers that be" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready
You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun
Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come
Never come, dance in the rain, it ain't gonna come
Enslave and impoverish the middle class
Make them dependent then strip it all away
Al-CIA-da, destruction, and democide
Addiction, corruption, every word's a lie
Races, classes, sexes, religious wars
Destroy the family, and what love is for
The Fed and the Bankers own all the politicians
May I introduce you to the sons of perdition?
Replace the dictators Washington appointed
The Devil Messiahs and the dangerously disappointed
They lie to themselves, pleased with what they've done
Soon they all will be repaid and there's nowhere to run
Thermal count is rising in perpetual writhing
The primordial ooze and the sanity they lose
Awakened in the morning to more air-pollution warnings
Still we sleepwalk off to work as our nervous systems jerk
Pretending not to notice how history has forbode us
With the greenhouse in effect our environment was wrecked
Now I can only laugh as I read our epitaph
We end our lives as moles in the dark of the dawn patrol
Maybe you might have heard
But no one spoke a word
The day the planet cried
The day the music died
Each day another dream
Killed by the music scene
All access was denied
The day the music died
We paid for everything
But back not a single thing
Our talents were all sucked dry
The day the music died
We saw it on T.V.
In all the magazines
We thought the news had lied
The day the music died
This is make believe
This is not for real
This won't last forever
This won't last at all
Eliminate the scene
It's illegal now to sing
Outlaws ask the reasons why
The day the music died
Now imprisoned for my craft
I smile and have to laugh
In my head the music's still alive
The day the music died
As all our hopes were dashed
Seems that all our throats were slashed
How could all our songs survive
The day the music died
Greedy fat bureaucrats
Care only for sales and stats
Woke up with dollar signs in their eyes
The day the music died
Come now my lovely, won't you
Take a midnight stroll with me?
Through the misty air the things
I keep I shouldn't dare

My garden's so inviting, and its
Deadly blooms are hiding
Be careful what you touch
'Less the grave is what you lust

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the deadly nightshade

Each night at midnight
Dating back into the fog of time
Another victim falls
The things I've done, the voices call

The Hourglass runs out on us
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The killers must be fed, the soil is red
Now that you're dead

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the deadly nightshade

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the deadly nightshade

Delirium, your burning throat
Mania, your heart rate soars
Hallucination, you're losing your mind
Suffocation, cannot breathe, you're going blind

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the deadly nightshade

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the deadly nightshade

Deadly nightshade
Deadly nightshade
Nightshade, nightshade
Don't want to talk about it
Don't want to read about it
Don't want to hear about it
Don't want to see about it
Something's funny about a medical physician
Me lying on my back is his favorite position
Designer behavior with paxil, and valium
Even you can stomach prozac and lithium
Remember "Ozzie And Harriet"?
Remember "The Stepford Wives"?
Remember "Father Knows Best"?
Remember "I Love Lucy"?
A product of design
Back to the drawing board
Gotta be insane to fit in
If not you'll be ignored
You take apart my brain
But you couldn't make the pieces fit
Then give me happy pills
There's pieces left you idiot
The light that fill my lonely cell,
Is blocked out by the key,
That locks the door to this hell,
The place they wanted me.
Time's racing like the wind,
Execution's near.
Oh Lord, I wait for death,
And yes, I have no fear.
I recall that night, my every breath,
And step along the way.
Closed my eyes, walking,
As danger paved the way.
The devil and the darkness
Let her evil wander free.
And here on Devil's Island,
The final stop for me.
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!
Oh there's no escape,
The sea is full of sharks.
The tides take you way
And smash you on the rocks.
The sun is shining,
But feel not today,
Its warmth, it's dying,
And fading away.
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!
Oh hear the call,
From the grave beyond
Oh so pernicious,
Her soul could, it creates song.
As there is no man that is
Here upon the earth,
Able to terminate our
Noisome will since birth.
The priest that reads the sermons,
Is walking next to me,
To the stake, my last request,
To have her burn with me.
But so it did, the heavens opened,
Rain began to fall.
The final judgment came.
And was spread before you all.
Final Judgment!
Old, weak, and feeble,
But the lesson taught to me,
To stay away from evil,
She doesn't care for me.
She haunts me in my sleep,
Though I tore that page away.
And here on Devil's Island,
I'll always have to stay.
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!
Here I am
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!
Sacrilege and blasphemy set the stage today 
The more insatiable the sex, the more swelled our tongues became 
As prehistoric as this seems, this is now, today 
Talkin' about no vision, talkin' about no dream 
The harlot puddles for her lies from where she speaks 
I look above and see entrails in the sky 
This one ain't over until the fat lady dies 
One man rules the earth and rides a seven headed beast 
Ten Diadems to crown them all 
World religion at his feet 
Dreams are told of dreams of old this day would surely come 
So run my child and hide your face 
Once you've been marked you're finished, one 
You've become one! 
You're mine! 
You're one. 
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away 
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away 
Vengeance is mine! 
Vengeance is mine! 
The Netherworld and Sheol and never satisfied 
So the eyes of man are never satisfied 
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away
It's twilight and I wake up hot 
My body's soaked in a cold, cold sweat 
I reenact the lurid scenes 
And clawed engravings in my head 
Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run 
I can't kick high enough and I run 
I can't shoot straight enough and I run 
I can't hold on enough and I run 
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run 
I can't take pain enough and I run 
I can't bleed fast enough 
I can't die dead enough 
The air is thick, but the oxygen's thin 
My heart is beating like a drum, boom! 
And ice is flowing through my veins 
Explosives on my lips and in my lungs 
Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run 
I can't kick high enough and I run 
I can't shoot straight enough and I run 
I can't hold on enough and I run 
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run 
I can't take pain enough and I run 
I can't bleed fast enough 
I can't die dead enough 
I don't know what I'm running from 
And I don't know where I'm running to 
There's something deep and strange inside of me I see 
I don't know what I'm running from 
And I don't know where I'm running to 
Something's compelling me to run into the dark 
And now I am more driven than before 
And now I live just to settle score 
And now I feel the nearness of your breath 
Now I introduce you to your death  
I am more driven than before 
I live just to settle score 
I feel the nearness of your breath 
I introduce you to your death 
I can't punch hard enough 
I can't kick high enough 
I can't shoot straight enough 
I can't hold on enough 
I can't stay down enough, die dead enough 
I can't take pain enough, die dead enough 
I can't bleed fast enough, die dead enough

Behind closed doors all you live for is taking
That double life of yours has left your whole world shaking
Who are you fooling? I know you hear the laughter
Don't you hear people talking? what is it that your after?

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just disconnect

The key to save yourself if for nothing else
A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden
With a broken heart underneath all of the pain
Do you stroke the pretty scars? the hurt never ends

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just disconnect

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real, anything's so real so you just disconnect

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just disconnect
When things were good I know you would always be there for me
Yes, It's true; friends like you are few and far between
I wish I may, I wish I might, the things you do ain't quite right
Just ain't right
And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend
Don't turn your back
When things were bad you always had something else better to do
It's just a lie to think that I could ever mean anything to you
You steal what's mine then help me look for it;
How many times do I pay for it? How many times?
And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend
And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend
Don't turn your back
Let me introduce myself I'm a social disease
I've come for your wealth leave you on your knees
No time for feeling sorry, I got here on my own
I won't ask for mercy, I choose to walk alone
What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand better count your fingers
What if I do get caught? 
What if there is no judgment?
If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all
I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences
Are dread and the fugitive mind
You built walls to protect you so no one will infect you
Pursued by those out there that vanish in thin air
Come a long way to find what you really left behind
You don't know when the end is but it's coming fast
What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand better count your fingers
What if I do get caught? 
What if there is no judgment?
If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all
I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences
Are dread and the fugitive mind
What you don't know, the legend goes, can hurt you 
If you only want to live and die in fear 
They tell us to believe just half of what we see 
And absolutely nothing that we hear
Resist the twised truth no matter what the cost
Supplant the rights with wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes when someone ends up dead
Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
What you don't know, the legend goes, can't hurt you
If you only want to live and die in a cage
There's panic and there's chaos rampant in the streets
Where useless thoughts are peace are met with rage
Demoralized and overmastered people think
The quickest way to end a war is lose
Dictatorship ends starting with tyrannicide
You must destroy the cancer at its root
Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
You live in a world of fantasy
You live in a web of deceit
You want it all including me
You like it all to be neat

I come to you when shadows fall
I leave as the dawn arrives
Hide the truth to deceive them all
How my good intention lies
Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring, ecstasy

Secret meetings that we hide
Deeds of iniquity
The price of foolish pride
The cost of immorality
And we hide the truth to deceive them all
And the pain of what will never be
Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring, ecstasy
Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring, ecstasy
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes
I hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods
On Judgment Day
A blink of an eye between
The cradle and the grave
One last look at visions of flesh
The last best hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands
The world don't want to be saved
Only left alone
Elysian Fields...
We are storming the heavens
To raise our swords and shields
We ascend to our destiny
To the Elysian Fields
Soaring to the sun
With blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief,
One decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms
Is like cancer to their bones
Attention! Attention!
All citizens are ordered to report to their District detention centers!
Do not return to your homes,
Do not contact anyone!
Do not use any cellular or G-P-S devices!
Surrender all weapons at once!
Attention! This way to the camps!
I woke up in a black FEMA box
Darkness was all around me, in my coffin
My dreams are all nightmares anymore
And this is what I dream every night
The Leader of the New World Order, the President of the United States
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A
Without the R-F-I-D chip, you're just an illegal alien
An enemy combatant of America, welcome to the New World Order
This is the end of the road, this is the end of the line
This is the end of your life, this is the
A society in a society, inside the fence life as you know it stops
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die, the clock is
Ticking so slowly and so much can happen in an hour
I learned my lessons the hard way, every scar I earned
I had to bleed, inside the day yard
A system of controlled movement, like a giant ant farm
Any time is long time, now you're not in charge of your time anymore
The Ex-President signed a secret bill that can
Land a legal US Citizen in jail and the
Patriot act stripped away our constitutional rights
They say a Concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!
Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecute and beat by the
Tyranny of Mind control, for the mark of the beast
All rights removed, you're punished, captured, and enslaved
Believe me when I say, this is the endgame!
"Here we go crush, crush, Crush'em"
There once was a familiar face
Battle scars in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything 
Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within? 
Pyramids of dead men and dogs
Spoils of war so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay 
Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within? 
Pressure coming down
Down on me, gonna break
Broken fingernails
Digging in, scratch your face 
Nervous, like a cat
Gonna jump through my skin
Shadows on the wall
Stretching out, grope for me 
Evil, evil
Evil, deep in me
Evil, let me be
Evil, let me bleed
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
The evil that's within
Looking for a cure within the human race 
Eliminate the poor, how much longer will it take 
Burning up the tents of the rank and file 
Exterminate their lives, crack a demon smile 
Crushing down, caving in our will to live 
Getting rid of man's mistakes 
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down 
How much more can we take 
Fight for freedom, fight authority 
Fight for anything, my country tis' of me 
Cry for absolution, it's not the end for me 
A last minute pardon, one final reprieve 
Resist the war machine, don't get in its path 
Fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath 
Crushing down, caving in our will to live 
Getting rid of man's mistakes 
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down 
I don't know how much more I can take 
Fight!... It's my country
Forgotten things remembered 
The tigers eat their young 
The body stayed but inside the head 
The mind was on the run 
Conspiracy of silence 
The only way out of pain 
Is turn around and run through it man 
Too wet to come in from the rain, 
Tell them... 
I know they were doing it to you 
But don't try doing it to me 
Let me show you, how I love you 
It's our secret, you and me 
Let me show you how I love you 
But keep it in the family tree... 
The secret of the family tree 
When you hear them saying "Trust me" 
Don't wait to see what's next 
Thrown to the wolves 
Forever trusting 
Raised in a form of living Hell 
Sing a one note song of rage 
Live and die within your heart 
So beware in the shadows 
Your family tree waits in the dark 
I say...
I have no face
I have no mind
I have no senses left
You see I'm blind

I feel no faith
I hear no truth
The reasoning's I have
Have all come loose

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood
That runs through me

I lie hear numb
My conscience clear
And all the decency
Tran-fused to fear

I feel no faith
I hear no truth
The reasoning's I have
Have all come loose

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood
That runs through me

You took my life and all I live for
I'm left for dead
Cold blooded and in hell

There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice

I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood that runs through me
Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean
Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling the the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar
Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound
Any day.  Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it
Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night
Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on
Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound
Any day.  Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it
Do you like it heavy
Do you love it loud
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it
The night of reckoning
The days of old
His might is menacing
Sword and shield made of gold
[Chorus]
Conquest and fire
The age of desire
When man will be free once more
Like rays from the sun
That heal everyone
Living for evermore
Bow down in reverence
Keep faith be true
Give thanks for armistice
Be brave he'll come through
[Chorus]
Conquest and fire
We will be strong
Days of desire
Making us stronger
Revenge and reckoning
Beware of this god
His might is menacing
Shield made of gold
Sword and shield of gold
The mighty stand alone
[Chorus]
Conquest and fire
We will be strong
Days of desire
Making us stronger
Conquest attest
Stands triumphant
Heaven sent, be vigilant
Don't relinquish
The night wind blows
Your heart rate grows
Your pulse is racing faster

They're on your trail
They know you'll fail
You're flirting with disaster

Creatures

The frost lies thick
Your breath comes quick
No chance for your survival

Life takes it's toll
And burns your soul
They've never had a rival

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night

Creatures

Their sense of smell
Was honed in hell
Their eyes sharp as needles

You're bathed in sweat
You've lost your bet
Caught in this upheaval

Creatures

You're on your own
So scream and moan
It's pointless now for praying

They'll run you through
You'll get what's due
Then they'll call it a day

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night

Creatures

The night wind blows
Your heart rate grows

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight

Creatures of the night
Born and raised to fight
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Creatures
Watch your own reflection
Read between the lines
Lost in this confusion
It's a sign of the times

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go

Opium for the masses
World's gone deaf and dumb
Victims of insanity
Ruled by the gun

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go

Too much information
Messes with your mind
Pushing back the enemy
Blind leads the blind

World of smoking mirrors
Leaves you in a daze
Find your own solution
Out of the maze

Searing on the bible
Hypocrites and fools
Losing your religion
Breaking all the rules

Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go
Caught in the crossfire
You gotta let go

Caught in the crossfire
Caught in the crossfire
Caught in the crossfire
Caught in the crossfire
He lies in wait
For one mistake
Morphing on your screen
Those who dare
Or the unaware
Download him for a scream
Don't access the site
Or beware his megabyte
No virus scan
Detects the man
Or the deadly tasks he plans
Drooling lips
His circuits lit
He crouches for attack
Spider like on the web
Alive and well
But you are dead
Iniquitous in every way
Now he's come out to play
Cyberface
Iron will
Programmed to corrupt and kill
Cyberface
No escape
He is interfaced to Hell
Once he's summoned and installed Cyberface
He'll infest your motherboard Cyberface
Now he's got a grip
He will strip away your flesh
Alive yet dead
A fiend obsessed
He'll crash your system down
Once in place
He'll simulate
Your life it's worthless now
God forsaken
Grotesque mind
An entity
That's come alive
Boot your screen
And suddenly
Approaching fast and mean
Once he's summoned and installed Cyberface
He'll infest your motherboard Cyberface
Forged in the Black Country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realize
Driving in that transit
Down to Holy Joe's
Used to lose our head while metal flowed
Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood won't let us die
We built our world of metal watched it grow
Fueled the fury solid to the bone
Gotta deal with the devil
'Cause you know that's it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel
Rollin' down the M-Way
Took it to the smoke
Banging heads there 'til we all went broke
When we don the leather
And the whips and chains
Nothing matters more, we can't be tamed
Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow into one voice
Took on the whole world it had no choice
Late at night
You're in our sight
Where we can feel what we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
On this stage, let it rage
For a time we leave the world behind
To be with our own kind
I will take your final breath
And I will be your last regret
Cold blood, runs in my blackened heart
Tearing, every soul apart
[Chorus]
Messenger of death, wields the scythe
Of man's damnation
Messenger of death, hold his blade
For termination
Sin, is what I feast upon
I'm forging my crematorium
Your tomb, is waiting here for you
Welcome to my ritual
[Chorus]
Death rides out from the storm
We turn to God and cry
Ignored we turn to face
This vengeance from the sky
Death rides out from the storm
No time left to repent
No quarter, no escape
No line of self defense
Death rides out from the storm
In terror we confess
Our voice is heard no more
His deed is merciless
Death rides out from the storm
Deface humanity
There's no escape from this
Human calamity
Death rides out from the storm
We turn to God and cry
Ignored we turn to face
This vengeance from the sky
[Chorus]
Let me out
Sorry son
Commit a crime, pay the price
Death row, What's that 'No stay?'
Oh! Ok I'll tell him
Dead man walking
We've all been detained
For the crimes we've committed
They stayed execution
But we'll never get acquitted
Waiting for the day when they strap us in
And when they pull the lever
Hear the goddamn screams
Shake with fear
Electric chair
We're all inside
Homicide related
They'll show no mercy
And we don't anticipate it
We move a little closer
Every day to meet our maker
They cover up our face
And then they close the circuit breaker
Oh! No!
Shake with fear
Your time draws near
Oh! No! I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh come on man
Give me a break
I made one mistake, that's all it takes
I ain't that bad
I ain't done nothing wrong
Shake with fear
The end is near
Oh! No! I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh! No! They're taking me slow
One way ticket to 
Death row
So what's the matter son
Too young to die
Take it like a man
Don't cry
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Oh! No! I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Say a prayer, best beware
It's not very nice in the electric chair
Oh! No! I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh! No! They're taking me slow
One way ticket to 
Death row
Your head
You will lose it
Severed
When executed
You always thought
You'd never get caught
Decapitate
Sealing your fate
Rebels
Futile efforts
Are quelled
With effective measures
The sentence is read
Word that you dread
Decapitate
Walk through Hell's gate
You've lost your head sir
Well you will tomorrow - sleep well
This court's
Best deterrent
To set
New precendents
The verdict of course
Couldn't be worse
Decapitate
Example be made
Decapitate
Will seal your fate
Solar winds are blowing
Neutron star controlling
All is lost, doomed and tossed, at what cost forever
Meteors fly around me
Comets die, and then they
And then they, you want to see how they try to surround me
I can say, here today, we shall stay forever
If you want to find us in a hurry
Oh let me tell you don't you worry
I can't say, here today, we shall stay forever
(instrumental)
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
Feeling like we're, ready to kick tonight
No hesitating, my bodies aching
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof
Megaton, Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uh, Delivering the goods
Uh, Delivering the goods
Shake down, rock 'em boys, crack that whip strap mean
Pulse rate, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been
Stealing your hearts all across the land
Hot blood doing good, we're going to load you with our brand
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uh, Delivering the goods
Yeah, Delivering the goods
Have it your way
Stealing your hearts
Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is
Bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
you're nothing more than yellow
Gonna do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You gotta learn your lesson
'Cause there ain't nobody here to defend your heart
Faster, higher
'Til it seems that we're gonna break
Oh shootin' further, giving more than you're ever gonna take
Leaving your heads
Crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uh, Delivering the goods
Uh, Delivering the goods
Born of the sun
Crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled
Engorged hate from birth
Hellion's the steed
Blood's on the wing
Claws set to slice
Vengeance he'll bring
Cremating the land
In seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays
Napalm he'll deploy
The beast of a god
Regaled of his race
Prepare to onslaught
And bare face to face
Across the divide
The thresholds in flames
The Painkiller rises again
The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to posses us
Out, demons out
Blade of the wheel
Cuts deep in the bone
It's Gideon's quest
To take Satan's throne
The critical mass
And power that they wield
Exterminates all
When vermin rebel
A maelstrom begins to disintegrate
And pulverize all in it's wake
Demonizer
Out, out, out, demons out
Full moon is rising
The sky is black
I need your call I'm coming back
The road is straight cast
Wind's in my eyes
The engine roars between my thighs
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
I was cross-wired underground
Nothing seemed to fit
I was fried and memory bound
Then it came to me
Devil digger
Unforgiver
I was on a different plane
He said come to me
Laid his hands upon my brow
That's the last of me
Devil digger
Unbeliever
Don't be sorry
It's no disgrace
But never worry (unless)
You have no faith
See him coming
He has no face
You must stop running
You must have faith
Death's not final so were told
Words are so profound
Who the hell wants to get old
But ask in the final hours
Devil digger unbeliever
Devil digger unforgiver
See him coming
He has no face
You must stop running
You must have faith
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to fade away
Hypnotize me
Mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip
Light my fire
With cold desire
Losing all my grip
Eat my diamonds
Drinking all my gin
Feast your eyes on
A whole lotta sin
Oh no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
Took my dreams
And now it's seems you're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre
Stop pretendin'
Got me growin' old
Your tormentin's
Fit to snap my soul
Oh no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
You took my heart
And left it blown to smithereens
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh
And drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed
Goin' under
Hear the thunder
Death defying grace
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face
Vicious talkin'
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised, so abused
I'm a human sacrifice
Oh no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Headed straight for a fall
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington square
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin
Come on, come on now what you say
Somebody say you leave today
What's this thing you're doin' to me
What's this fool you're tryin' to be
You're talkin' nothin' but a load of guff
You're tryin' to put somethin' in my lap, lap
Don't go. Please don't leave me
Don't go in the mornin'
Don't go. Please don't deceive me
Don't take it away
I do, I do anything for you
You make my stormy clouds blue
Inside out, I'm upside down
Back to front I'm all around
Don't cha leave me by myself
I don't like it
Don't go. Please don't leave me
Don't go in the mornin'
Don't go. Please don't deceive me
Don't take it away
My last days
We shall see
They are coming now
They're after me
They want blood
Yes it's true
Going quietly I just don't do

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

In my heart (in my heart)
I can say (I can say)
I'll be ready for what comes my way
Don't be fooled (don't be fooled)
I can tell (I can tell)
Where I'm going to will serve me well

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

Leaving my mark on the world when I've gone
Spreading the word by the deeds that I've done

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Welcome to my world of steel
Master of my domain
Cower as the pain's unsealed
Disasters where I'll reign

Father of Sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Fire in the sky
Paralyzed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Icon to the fall of man
Worshipped like a king
Fearless as I now condemn
Every living thing

Father of Sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Fire in the sky
Paralyzed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Father of Sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Relish the blaze
Left all in a daze
He came and consumed and let fly

Fire in the sky
Paralyzed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Fire in the sky
Paralyzed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near
Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow trees
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
He could control our sense of time
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
Everyone was in peace of mind
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
Just seemed to vanish in thin air
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free, oh they're free
We are lost above
Floating way up high
If you think you can find a way
You can surely try
Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Quite open minded but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said I was there
Led to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raise the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
Every few moments I see I friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led
Killer, killer, keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying, every single day
Is this the way that you get your fun
Slaying, waylaying, in the heat of the midday sun
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob
You make me sick, getting paid for murder
You wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh no
You never ever dream to hurt her
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds, cause you won't go to hell
Take your medal, wear it now with pride
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside
Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let 'er rip
Eat me alive
Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver 
As you give and I collect
Squealing impassioned 
As the rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye

Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
You don't know I'm there

I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

Protected. Detective. Electric eye
The old man's sitting there, his head bowed down
Every now and then he'll take a look around
And his eyes reflect the memory-pain of years gone by
He can't regain nostalgic dreams he'll never see again
With trembling hands, he wipes a tear
Many fall like rain, there's one for every year
And his life laid out so clearly now, life that's brought death
So nearly now life once he clung to dearly now lets go 
But spare a thought as you pass him by
Take a closer look and you'll say
He's our tomorrow, just as much as we are his yesterday
A lonely grave, and soon forgot
Only wind and leaves lament his mournful song
Yet they shout his epitaph out clear
For anyone who's passing near
It names the person lying here as you
And you, and you, and you
And so now it comes to pass
By the even tide on mass
See them gather yet alas
They remain still as stained class
For they know only too well
That the story they will tell
Conjures up an ageless spell
Guarded by the Sentinel
So it goes forever more
Ever steady to the core
That the sign that they came for
Waves majestic from the floor
I traveled to a distant shore
I felt I had to go
An inner voice had called me there
But why I did not know
I saw the evening star rise up
Shining out to sea
And now I understand at last what it means
What it all means

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

I used to tempt fate
I couldn't see straight
I faltered through my younger days
Never knowing where I was going
Then something helped me penetrate the haze

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

Now I am stronger
The haze no longer
Ruins my future destiny
Such inspirations and new sensations
Pull up these string ties chasing me

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

I'm home once more, much better for
The things that I have found
Much wiser now, so simple how
Each time I turn around
I see the evening star rise up
Shining out on me
And now I understand at last what it means
What it all means

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
We turn and face each other
My fingers pull your hair
You wince and jerk my wrist off
I bite my lip and stare
Your stance at once defiant
I'm rigid to your pose
You clench your teeth in anger
My loving swells and grows

You give me evil fantasies
I wanna get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil you can't hide

You're dragged into my vision
Trapped, serving to my need
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds
You slide your nails down in me
I raise my structure high
You pout, I snarl, you whimper
And wave compassion by

You give me evil fantasies
I wanna get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil you can't hide

Gonna take you, gotta get through
Gonna make you, do what I want

You're dragged into my vision
Trapped, serving to my need
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds
The devil's moved from Georgia
His mission's still the same
The world's become his oyster once again
If you don't think you're worthy
And you don't meet the cause
He knows what's going on behind closed doors
Beware there's voodoo in the nights
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
A master of deception
Who takes you by the hand
Then leads you to the palace of the damned
He pulls the strings inside you
And plays upon your fears
Your final scream is music to his ears
Beware there's voodoo in the nights
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
I'm caught up in this voodoo
Trying to break free
I feel I'm being smothered
Trapped by this entity
Blackened clouds surround me
Filling me with dread
I can't escape the horror
With the devil in my head
He relishes the suffering
Can't stand this heart attack
My life's been taken hostage
And it's never coming back
Beware there's voodoo in the nights
The devil's got you in his sight
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Racing' cross the heavens
Straight into the dawn

Salvation is his task

Everything he touches fries into a crisp,
Let him get close to you so you're in his trip,

Blister up and singe

Exciter comes

You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
He's come to make you snap out Of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you See the light again
So much self-indulgence Results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency Leads to beguiling lies
Stand by for exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for exciter
Salvation bids to ask
When he leaps amidst us
With combustive dance
All shall bear the branding Of his thermal lance,
Cauterizing masses Melting into one
Only when there's order Will his job be done.

I must leave from fear they send
Journey with the dawn
As I take the winding road
Bow my head forlorn
Now I must go
I'm banished in exile
I wander this land
No faith in the future
I'm in their command
Cross over the mountains
And valleys so wide
I walk as I wonder
With hope by my side
All my friends are far away
How I miss my home
Where do I find peace of mind
Guide me as I roam
I cry for you
I'm banished in exile
To meet their demand
Rejected messiah
They don't understand
I'm searching for something
That's lost in my heart
God knows I'm a sinner
I'm falling apart
If this is my destiny
I've got to believe
The passion inside me
Has left me to bleed
I'm banished in exile
I wander this land
No faith in the future
I'm in their command
Cross over the mountains
And valleys so wide
I walk as I wonder
With hope by my side
If this is my destiny
I've got to believe
This passion inside of me
Has left me to bleed
They are dying on the dance floor
They are lying in debris
They are fading with exhaustion
From the mortal injuries
They are hungry and need feeding
They've resigned themselves to fate
They are desperate men
Death's written on their face
When your will to live
Is all but gone
And you're left alone
But you need someone - feed on me
Feed on me
They're outgunned and they're outnumbered
But they'll never turn to run
And the "In the name of freedom's"
Written with their blood
Some would call them mercenary
But they always knew the pain
Inevitably far outweighs the gain
Feed on me
Feed on me if you need to breathe
Feed on me
When your hunger strikes you down again
And you feel your inner strength has drained feed on me
Feed on me
Feed on me I got what you need
Feed on me
Feed on me don't accept defeat
They are dying on the dance floor
They are lying in debris
They are fading with exhaustion
From the mortal injuries
Some would call them mercenary
But they always knew the pain
Inevitably far outweighs the gain
When your will to live has almost gone
And you're left alone and you need someone
Feed on me
Feed on me
Feed on me
Feed on me I got what you need
Feed on me
Feed on me don't accept defeat
I'd spend my days alone
I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there
Like I was in a cell
A captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control
Down on the streets below
Bright city lights would glow
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze
Still counting empty days
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break this spell
Fever. You set my soul on fire
Fever. You fill me with desire
Fever. You always get it right
Fever. All day and all night
Then one night as I walked
I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar
Oh how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this
Fever. You set my soul on fire
Fever. You fill me with desire
Fever. You always get it right
Fever. All day and all night
So destiny has bought us
Oh so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream
At last I'll be with you forever
And all at once it feels so right
Fever. You set my soul on fire
Fever. You fill me with desire
Fever. You always get it right
Fever. All day and all night
Get a grip on the action
I'm moving heaven and earth
Don't let go of the action
Push for all that you're worth

No denying
It goes against the grain
So Defying
You're screaming again

Fight for your life
Fight for your money
Fight for your life
Fight for your money

Time for steel, stop at nothing
Looking fate in the face
We don't take no for an answer

Grab the lead in the race
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
A hard resolution
That is true to the end
With weapons drawn we claim the future
And then seep out through every storm
Bring in the foe to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk to dawn
Firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
The die is cast, make no exceptions
We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally 'round this lack of freedom
Our unions rise so go to hell
Firepower
Taking lives
Firepower
Neutralize
Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives on danger
It's bound to explode
Aim for the target
With laser and lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight
No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace
We fight this firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
Between the eyes
Firepower
Mortifies
Firepower
Man's demise
Look to the sky and face the sun
You better try to race against the gun
There's nothing left for you to prove
You get a chance then now's the time to move
Nothing to rival
This heavy load
Pray for survival
End of the road
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, incinerate by the flame thrower
No remedy so be afraid
It's cutting deep just like the razor blade
No escape, you're in a spell
Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell
Rays of redemption
Fall from the sky
Into the maelstrom
Blink of an eye
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, annihilate by the flame thrower
Immolate the bodies
No one will be saved
Consecrate with fire
Ashes fill the grave
Look to the sky and face the sun
You better try to race against the gun
There's no escape, you're in a spell
Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell
Nothing to rival
This heavy load
Pray for survival
End of the road
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, terminate by the flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would
Contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any date
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in never stops the
Way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
Mercenary battalions
Are poised to strike us down
Terminations conquest
Upon us now full grown
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Devastation hungers
She waits to leap to earth
Imminent liquidation
Before the grand rebirth
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Sin after sin I have endured
Yet the wounds I bear are the wounds of love
Frantic mindless zombies
Grab at fleeting time
Lost in cold perplexion
Waiting for the sign
Generations tremble
Clinging face to face
Helpless situation
To end the perfect race
Flashing senseless sabers
Cut us to the ground
Eager for the life blood
Of all who can be found
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Slice to the left, slice to the right
None to retaliate, none will fight
Chopping at the hearts, snuffing out the lives
This race departs, no one will survive
Heads to the feet, feet to the air
Souls in the soil, heavy in despair
End of all ends, body into dust
To greet death friends, extinction is a must
Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks,
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks,
And you come creeping around, making me do things I don't want to do.
Can't believe that she needs my love so bad.
Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad.
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see.
'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown
All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, and slip away
Leaving me here, trying to keep from following you
Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight
Capped everywhere
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
I've held my license
It came with birth,
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions
To the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

Fierce is the gale
On the north sea
We drink and rejoice from the chalice
Holding the course
Through long nights and days
The ice and the hail bear no malice
Tow the line
Keep it fine
Every man seeks this end

Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, I belong

We crash o'er the waves
Bite deep on the oars
Scouring the spray
On the storm's maul
Then lightning reveals
For what we all pray
By Odin in Asgard
It's land fall
Life from death
Combat rests
Heralds peace for the slain

Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, I belong

The storm in the night takes us there
On an unrelenting tide
As the wind drives us ashore
Halls of Valhalla
Tow the line
Halls of Valhalla
Tow the line
Tow the line
Keep it fine
Every man seeks this end

The halls of Valhalla are calling me home
The halls of Valhalla that's where we belong
Valhalla you are calling
Valhalla you are calling me home

Valhalla new day dawning
Valhalla this is where I belong, I belong
Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more pain you'll feel
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice
Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
So expect the worst
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry
Is victory, is victory
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
Hit 'em boys!
Well I've said it before, and I'll say it again
You get nothing for nothing:  expect it when
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel
It's easy to go along with the crowd,
And find later on that your say ain't allowed
Oh that's the way to find what you've been missing
So I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall!
You can hang in a left or hang in a right
The choice it is yours to do as you might
The road is open wide to place your bidding
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go
If you get it wrong, at least you can know
There's miles and miles to put it back together!
And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall!
On the highway!
On the highway!
Making a curve or taking the strain
On the decline, or out on the wain
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend
Back on your feet to take the next bend!
You weather every storm that's coming atcha!
And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
Yes, I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all. I got nothing to lose at all!
Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
I know you like it hot
Love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothin' yet

Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty

We'll rise inside ya till the power
splits your head
We're gonna rock ya till your metal
Hunger's fed

Let's all join forces
Rule with iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
So come on let's tell the world
I have roamed so far away
I have found there's no turning back
I have seen so many things
I have been to hell and back

Still in the land of the living
Rocking the home of the brave
Staying alive and still kicking
Ain't got no need to be saved

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

When I was young life was savage
The leather gets scuffed as it's worn
Rolling along you get damaged
So you grab the bull by the horns

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
Taking it up higher when you're under attack

We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

We have roamed so far away
We have found there's no turning back
We have seen so many things
We have been to hell and back

Out of the fire and into the black
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
Taking it up higher when you're under attack

We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back

We've all been under attack
We've all been to hell and back

We've all been under attack
We've all been to hell and back

We've all been under attack
We've all been to hell and back

We've all been under attack
We've all been to hell and back
Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels, 
A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams, 
From a streak of fire as he strikes
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, of sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools
Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams
Crash one by one to the ground
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
You're looking at me why
Sort of like a leper vibe
Okay for your kind
But it's too good for me
And a hey I know I'm
Never gonna qualify
For all the bullshit
Of your social degrees
Oh look down your noses at me
Hating my identity
Oh but that don't mean a damn thing you see
'Cause down here in Hell everybody loves me
Hey I know I'm anti-social
'Cause you act like I'm infected
With some atrocity
And though I know I'm
Every bit the same inside
My face don't fit
It's like I've got some disease
Oh you keep your face turned away
To strip me of identity
Oh still got my fortune and fame
'Cause down here in Hell everyone knows my name
Hell is home to me
Might as well be
I like it here and nowhere else invited me
Hell is home to me
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)
Nobody else invited me
Now I belong
I found my home
'Cause even though I know things won't
Get any better, they can certainly never get much worse
Hell is home to me
Might as well be
I like it here and nowhere else invited me
Hell is home to me
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)
Nobody else invited me
Say my whole life I've always been disliked
Ignored unless you're spitting insults at me
And I don't know why you felt so justified
In all the degradation that you dished on me
Oh! Now my status has changed
And you've got yourself to blame
Oh! I'll grab all the attention I crave
Now I'm running Hell, Heaven won't be the same
Hell is home to me
Might as well be
I like it here and nowhere else invited me
Hell is home to me
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)
Nobody else invited me
Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road

Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol

Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground

Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
The Hell Patrol

Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporize you

Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you

Crome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs
The Hell Patrol
Here they come
These gods of steel
Megatron
Devouring what's concealed
Speed of Death
Crossfired they stare
Final breath
From vaporizing glares

Raised to man oppressed
Sign of persecution

Hellrider
Roars through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight

All incensed
To overthrow
Strong defense
With armaments they grow
By this quest
Their fate's renowned
Put to rest
Abominations crown

Time to ram it down
Judgment for the tyrant

Hellrider
Roars through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
Fight undying and eternal
Wheels bring death and pain infernal
Honor bound your strength repleted
To no end they're undefeated

Hellrider, Hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider, Hellrider
You brought them through their despair
Hellrider, Hellrider
Your tempered steel relinquished
Hellrider, Hellrider
You slaught them all extinguished

Wrath of doom
In killing fields
They consume
Their valiants never yield

Triumph to the gods
Vanquished of enslavers

Hellrider
Breaking their will
Hellrider
In for the kill

Hellrider, Hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider, Hellrider
You brought them through it all
Hellrider
Once I dreamed that love would come and sweep me up away
Now it seems life's passed me by, I'm still alone today
Here come the tears
Looks like it'll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears
All alone, no one cares.
So much to give to you all out there.
Take me now, in your arms.
Let me rest, safe from harm.
Ohh I want to be loved
I need to be loved
Won't somebody love me
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears                                
Here they come, here come the tears  
Here they come, here come the tears                                
Here they come, here come the tears
Here they come, here come the tears                                
Here they come, here come the tears
Here come the tears                                 
Here come the tears

Here come the tears, ohh
Here come the tears, ohh
Here come the tears
I heard a human voice who sang like no one else
I heard a proud lady singing loud
Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn
But soon she found she was underground and wasted
I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage
Her body shook oh, she did her stuff
She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much
If you take the smooth you gotta take the rough
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid
I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd
I felt the sound shower 'round
And he would take you with him where no music's been before
As you merged the power surge together
His music knew no limits if you were in it's wake
You had no choice, no, but hear its voice
And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream
But once so strong survive or become weak
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid
If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds
I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame
But fast car user lose
That legend's born from death and that is such a shame
'Cause every year new ones appear
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid
Hope in my heart
As a new day has dawned
I see your light on the wings of a dove
Lifting me up as the dark clouds retreat
Courage transcends and you make me complete
Hope in my heart with the advent of spring
I am reborn with the love that you bring
I've done my share of workin' out
I wanna go some place where I can scream and shout
Show me the lights, where I can find
The only thing I need to give me peace of mind
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'
Where is the spark that kicks the air
Where is the energy that charges everywhere
I see the crowd, I hear the roar
I feel my body to leave the ground and soar
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'
I'm goin' out in search of the bright lights
Somehow I feel that tonight is the right night
I'm almost there I've got the vibration
It's coming strong from this generation
My blood is hot, from now on I'm set free
My pulse is hot, so don't try to stop me
'Cause this is it and I'm hot rockin'
Don't let it stop, don't let it end
Please let it carry on and on and on again
I get so high. Knocked off my feet yeah
This is the only way I want, I want, I want
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'
It's all I want, it's all I crave
I just want to go hot rockin'
Twenty-four hours of the day
You're on my trail
And I can't get away
I can't shake you off
You're a wolf on the prowl
You got my scent and I can hear you howl
No where to run
No where to hide
No where to go
No where to run to
No where to hide this hurt inside
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
When the sun goes down,
I can feel your heat
Till the sun comes up
When you've got me worn deadbeat
I said I'm all burned out
I'm a physical wreck
But there you go again with your
Hot breath on my neck.
No where to run
No where to hide
No where to go
No where to run to
No where to hide this hurt inside
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
No where to run
No where to run
No where to run to
No where to run
No where to run
No where to hide
No where to go
No where to run to
No where to hide this hurt inside
Hot for love
Hot for love
Oh baby hot for love
Yes you're hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me
And carved out of stone
I've broken hearts
Made people sing
I've drove a million miles
I've done everything
I'm a rocker, oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
I'm a rocker, oh oh
And no one can take that away
Bring on the night
That's when I live
I come alive inside
Give all I can give
I live each day
Like it's my last
I live for rock and roll
I never look back
I'm a rocker, oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
I'm a rocker, oh oh
And no one can take that away
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I'm a rocker
I can never get enough
I'm a rocker
It's something in my blood
I'm a rocker
Wouldn't change it even if I could
I'm a rocker, oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
I'm a rocker, oh oh
And no one can take that away
I am love, I am hate
I'm an atheist with faith
Vent my anger with a smile
I'm polite or obscene
Either whisper or I scream
I'm not quite what I seem
I'm somewhere in between
I am young in my old age
I am calm or in a rage
I'm your friend or enemy
A pacifist or at war
I am rich but I am poor
I'm all extremes
I'm nowhere in between
Wide awake
Or in a dream
Nowhere in between
Like the pulse of a machine
I'm driven to extremes
I feel the turmoil boil in me
I'm neither healthy nor diseased
I am all extremes
But I'm still in between
Say right or say wrong
Outcast yet I belong
I'm high or I'm dry
Say I am weak yet I am strong
In between
In between
I am my alter ego
I am subconsciously
In depth but also shallow
Or somewhere in between
Oh I know I am
Always first in line or last
I swim with sharks or drown with rats
I'll defend as I attack
My world and yours are not the same
I am in a different lane
I am not where I seem
But I'm somewhere in between
I seek revenge
As I forgive
I die to live ah
Not afraid but scared to death
I don't fit in
In between all extremes
I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow
I saw a seering flash of light erupt and skyward go
I staggered back in dazed surprise
What was it I had seen?
And as I stood there mesmerized I heard my spirit scream
Invader, invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
This is the first of more to come in carefully planned attacks
If it is so we must prepare defenses to fight back
The call is out throughout the world
United we must stand
To build a line, strategic force, they will not take a man
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
When they come to take control every man must play his role
They won't take our world away when the children we leave
Will have to believe in today
We warn you now you things out there
Whatever you may send
We won't give in without a fight, a fight until the end
With vigilance by day and night our scanners trace the sky
A shield is sealed upon this earth, a shield you won't get by
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
Invader invader nearby

Beware of their coming
Take heed our time is near
Fatality relinquish not
Brutality in arms doth seek to destroy.
They smashed through the clouds into the light of the moon
Their steeds were full charging, called destruction and doom
'Twas as if all hell had broke loose on this night
And all in all it was a terrible sight
Now we are taken unto the island of domination
We gotta get, we gotta get, we gotta get out of this place
There's a man with a needle who's pleading to get at my face
Hide me and hold me control free as best as you can
It's all becoming too much, I can't cope, for one man
Now we are taken unto the island of domination
Skyrider, you supersonic flyer
Nightdriver, you demon of desire
Spinesnapper, you tried your best to break us
Throatchoker, you thought that you could take us
The fright of your life, the fright of your life
The fright of your life is here guaranteed
This is no illusion confessing confusion you're freed
Lashings of strappings with beatings competing to win
Oh what a mess I am blessed, dominations set in
Now we are taken unto the island of domination
Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
on the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode
Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert
Your innocence all but fades
When we peel the veneer away
It's all an act which you stage
With your two-faced barricades
Rage consumes
You every night
Caged inside you
Trying to get out
Schizophrenic basic needs
Fools me into complacency
But now I see through your facade
Behind the mask a monster snarls
Hatred burning
In your chest
Dazed but learning
In your quest
Oh it's killing me your unpredictability
Oh all the time
You hide behind
Your Jekyll and Hyde
Now I realize
There's a dark side
Disguised
Always changing
Then love hating
Baiting me
Your innocence all but fades
When we peel the veneer away
It's all an act which you stage
With your two-faced barricades
Rage consumes you every night
Caged inside you trying to get out
Oh it's killing me your unpredictability
Oh all the time
You hide behind
Your Jekyll and Hyde
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods amongst the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
That never ever learned to read and write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Go go. Go Johnny go
Johnny B. Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Old engineer sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by would stop and say
"Oh my but how that little country boy could play"
Go go. Go Johnny go
Johnny B. Goode
His mother told him some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights, saying
 Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go go. Go Johnny go
Johnny B. Goode
White bolt of lightning
Came out of nowhere
Blinded the darkness
Creating the storm
War in the heavens
Vengeance ignited
Torment and tempest
Attacks like a swarm

Forged out of Flame
From chaos to destiny
Bringer of pain
Forever undying

Judas is Rising

Eternal betrayer
Ice cold and evil
Taking no prisoners
Dark prince of the world
Humanity trembles
Enslaving you sinners
You can't beg for mercy
For none will be saved
The burden of sin
Echoes the prophecy
Ascending from hell
Forever despising

Judas is Rising

Their faith is revealed
Deceivers are crying
By crucified steel
Evangelizing

Judas is Rising
Judas is Rising
Now let's see what you're made of
He is coming, you can't run
Violators that get caught
Will wish that they'd never been born
Exterminator
You are dead mutilate
Sharpened razor
Takes your head	Jugulator
Predit hater
You are trapped	decimate
Desecrator
Your neck snapped Jugulator
Jugulator he is near
Attracted by the stench of fear
Part demonic, part machine
Hungry and it's time to feed
Iron claws and fangs of steel
Dripping from his tasty meal
Now it's time to jugulate
Feel your skull disintegrate
Jugulator killing time now
Reaches in and rips your spine out
Violator
Big mistake mutilate
Vindicator
Rib cage break
Flesh and bones
Are massacred
Jugulator
Desecrator
Jugulator
I never give true answers, I never tell no lies
I never walk a straight line, so never get surprised
I don't ask no favors, so don't get abused
I learned to win when I was young
So I'm never ever going to lose
They pay me the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
I never ask no questions, I never speak my mind
I always found that silence helps to keep me and my kind alive
I take care of business, it takes care of me
I look after myself and do it well
Because somebody's always looking for me
They pay me the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
What manner of man am I?
A gun, lump sum and then I move on
What manner of man are you?
Stab a friend's back to jump a queue
I do what I do because I can't do nothing better
You do what you do, just defending yourself
Because you got nothing better to do
I got no face, no name, I'm just a killing machine
I cut the population down, if you know what I mean
I never stop in one place, I move about the cities
Got expensive tastes, but I hasten to add that
I'm the best that there is
They pay me the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
I got a contract on you
I got a contract on you
Throughout the soft and timeless days of August
'Til now the shadows begin to grow much longer
The sunset's fire has deepened blood red
I give you this, the last rose of summer
A token of my unyielding love
So when the winter's mantle stills the earth
And all around seems dead and cold
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living
Do not despair, mother nature simply rests
In sleep she has well earned
'Til one day not so very far from now
With the opening of the first rose buds I shall return
A token of my unyielding love
So that when winter's mettle steals the earth
And all around seems dead and cold
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
 In your long shadows
The last rose of summer
 In the sunset
The last rose of summer
 Take this rose that I give you
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
 Don't worry about the winter
The last rose of summer
 I shall return
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red

Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge

Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight

Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart

Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power

Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours

I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall
Call for the priest, I'm dying
I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
Twisted dreams that are formed from illusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike
Lightning will strike
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one A.M,
Loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again,
Loaded, loaded

I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel,
Loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal,
Loaded, loaded

My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm aiming for ya,
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long

The air's electric, sparkin' power,
loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour,
loaded, loaded

I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
Grey mist drifts upon the water
The mirrored surface moves
Awakened of this presence
Dispelling legends proof
A beastly head of onyx
With eyes set coals of fire
It's leathered hide glides glistening
Ascends the heathered briar
This legend lives through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternities
On and on and on
Loch Ness confess
Your terror of the deep
Loch Ness distress
Malingers what you keep
Loch Ness protects monstrosity
Loch Ness confess to me
Somehow it heeds the piper
From battlements that call
From side to side it ponders
In passion in the skirl
This highland lair of mystery
Retains a lost world empathy
Resilient to discovery
On and on and on
This legend lives through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternity
Your secret lies safe with me
This creature's peril from decease
Implores to mankind for release
A legacy to rest in peace
On and on and on
I can't stand the way you move it
You drive me crazy with that walk
You get me so excited
I tremble and I shake
When you make the moves you make
You've got the key
The key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours, for evermore
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
I can't take it when you touch me
Feels so good I could explode
You've got me in a frenzy
I tremble and I quake
When you shake the things you shake
You've got the key
The key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours, for evermore
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
Locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got the key
The key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours, for evermore
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in, baby
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in, baby
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
Hey, I am the voice of your anger
Hey, I am the voice of your pain
Hey, I crave the feeling of danger
Hey, I am the one with no name
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
They don't know the way that I'm feeling
They don't know the depth of the rage
I'm like the wolf that is prowling
Hey, I won't be found in a cage
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Lone wolf is there to guide me
From death to life again
I carry with me all the love that you give
You brought me serenity, a reason to live
Our life is a journey
That we took from the start
We made all these memories together
I can remember
The first time that we met
The feelings you gave to me, I'll never forget
I knew from that moment
When our love first began
We'd last till the end of time forever
And though there were bad times
We stood by each other
And did what we had to get through
You live in my heart, when you're far away
I see you in dreams where I hear you say
I'm with you forever, in true love
By light of the day and stars above
And when there were bad times
We held on each other
To face what we had to get through
You live in my heart, when you're far away
I see you in dreams, when I hear you say
Look up to heaven, and I'll be there
Still guiding my heart
Still saying our prayer
I always used to be afraid
That I was going to lose my way
I never used to walk in line but stray
I never thought I'd see it through
That I could deal with losing you
But suddenly I see the light of day
Leading me in
From out of the night
Staying on course I'm still alive
I had to confess I never thought I would ever survive
I was lost and found
I had run aground
I was lost but now I'm found
Focused on my altered state
I would just disorientate
Suffering alone amongst the crowd
Drifting on a sea of doubt
And no one ever heard me shout
That I was lost and couldn't find my way
No one at hand
Having no plan
Stumbled through a barren land
After so long
Of going wrong
I found the road
I was lost and found
I had run aground
I was lost but now I'm found
I was lost and found
I had hit the ground
I was lost but now I found
That I don't need no one
To survive
You've got to believe alone
You'll rise
Starting to run
Shedding the load
Now I can see I'm close to home
After so long
Of going wrong
I found the road
I was lost and found
I had run aground
I was lost but now I'm found
When you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise
That's when I crawl

Gliding on mist
Hardly a sound
Bring the kiss
Evils abound

In the dead of night love bites

Into your room
Where in deep sleep
There you lie still
To you I creep

Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend
You smile as I sip

Now you are mine
In my control
One taste of your life
And I own your soul

Softly you stir
Gently you moan
Lust's in the air
Wake as I groan

In the dead of night love bites

Love bites you
Invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you
Delights you
It drains you to white
Love bites

You knew at first sight
You'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite
There'd be no turning back

So come in my arms
I strike any hour
I will return
To trap and devour

In the dead of night love bites
You get me up, then we both get down
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds
I'm all tied up on your bed
I'd rather be inside your head
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back
Then you ease off with your attack
You're the best I've had if you please
You never stop, you great big tease
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
You're gonna get richer, I gotta get wild
Anytime you want to
Anyway you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy
I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full, do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light
You know where we're goin'
I know where where are
Set the rear view mirror for
The backseat or the car
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy
In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you
When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotized
Never seen nothin' like it no
You won't believe your eyes
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy
Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone
Licensed to kill
On my 
0 Bonneville
"Hellfire" we yell
Fueled and indestructible
Get it down
To take the crown
Neon daze
Renegades
No fear just hate
Drives us to the ultimate
Cut loose extremes
On our maniac machines
Take me down
Or hit the ground
Neon nights
At the speed of light
So you motherfuckers want to race
You've all got loser tattooed on your face
Machine Man's running - you wanna try
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die
Ignite the engines
You can hear it scream
You're gonna eat your words
That challenged this machine
The beast is revved up
The flag is down
The tires screech
And lay a smoke screen all around
Through the limits
As they rocket past
It's a blood bath
There's no second place
Machine Man's running - you wanna try
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming
Ice nerves of steel
As I notch another kill
You lose - I win
I get to ride again
Get it down
Hit the ground
Neon nights
Speed of light
Feel no mercy as I cross the line
Watch the suckers self-destruct behind
Machine Man's running
You wanna try
Machine Man's coming
You're gonna die
Machine Man's running - you wanna try
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die

We're walking, the streets
We know where, we'll meet
Can't stop us
They don't know why
They try

Can't hurt us
We'll never die
We are on the march of the damned
Of the damned

March of the damned

We know what's, at stake
Won't take your, mistakes

Can't break us
We'll never fall
That's all

It's over, just watch us grow
We are on the march of the damned
Of the damned

March of the damned

We're walking the streets
We know where we'll meet

Can't stop us
They don't know why
They try

Can't hurt us
We'll never die
We are on the march of the damned
Of the damned

March of the damned
We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath
Thrusting from a grave of unholy earth
Giving all his worth
Let the damned be saved
All that evil sin buried underground
Feeling safe and sound in his deadly skin

Heard the cry of pain so he's wide awake
No for heavens sake
He's become insane
How we feared the worst of a world gone mad
Never been so bad with a curse of
His immortal soul at stake
Hear the storm clouds break

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

Withe a clash of steel as the war begins
All he does is grin
At the pain he feels
Fixing for a war of a hundred years
With with no sense of fear tooth and nail will
Claw at flesh and bone to prevail
His honor will not fail

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

In this war that you can't win
You will die or live
He has ruled for a thousand years
He can't ever forgive

Fire and brimstone fill the earth and sky
Still he will defy

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

He will find you
Goes for your throat
Mesmerize you
He is the metalizer

Metalizer, metalizer
Metalizer, metalizer
It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all corners of the land
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of hand
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a
Monster.  Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Monster.  Monster of rock
They could never bind it
Impossible to stop
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in awe
At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for
And millions roared, and millions cheered
This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
I grew and grew in time, into a
Monster.  Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Monster.  Monster of rock
They could never bind it
Impossible to stop
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a
Monster.  Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Monster.  Monster of rock
They could never bind it
Impossible to stop
Born out of hell from the depths of Gomorrah
Purging new graves and defiling the souls
He satiates with such vile and dark horror
Omens of dread on this night of the ghouls
Raising the dead up from the ground
Needs must be fed, sorcerers abound
Necromancer
Death's his guiding lights
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
Feeding on flesh from the soil that was hallowed
Splintered the bones and regaled in his feast
Danced on the grave of the pure and the righteous
As the moonlight's expelled from the eyes of the beast
Raising the dead, blasphemy reigns
Portents of dread thrives on remains
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding lights
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
Raising the dead, cadaver consumed
Sacraments said, bodies exhumed
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding lights
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
Stealing afterlife
Death's his guiding lights
As the sun sets on another day
All the memories will never fade away
Looking back to all those moments that we shared
Where it all began with all those dreams we dared
We leave with no regrets, we will never forget

We'll play on till the end
It's not over not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget

When the dark skies came along to test our steel
We came together and showed the world just how we feel
So remember this
We can never fall
In our hearts we're all for one and one for all
So now we will rejoice
Tonight with one voice

We'll play on till the end
It's not over, not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget

In our hearts and in our minds
We know we can't leave this behind
In our hearts and in our soul
You know we'll never be alone

As we relive the best times of our lives
You were there for us and stood right by our sides
Yes we know that all good things come to an end
This is just farewell and not goodbye my friends
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget

We'll play on till the end
It's not over, not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget
Hope in my heart
As a new day has dawned
I see your light on the wings of a dove
Lifting me up as the dark clouds retreat
Courage transcends and you make me complete
Hope in my heart with the advent of spring
I am reborn with the love that you bring
Now at last my dream is real
I found peace
True love can heal
On the journey throughout time
A new beginning has arrived
At the crossroads of my life
This new love keeps me alive
I never knew that this could happen to me
So many lonely days and nights
I never knew that you were waiting for me
Hope was out of sight
And suddenly I see the future clearly
No longer living in the past
As I let go
Living the dream
Of my life
I was alone no-one in sight
This love, make me believe that you're the one
Never give up, our day has come
I never felt that this could happen to me
So many lonely days and lonely nights
I never knew that you were waiting for me
Hope was out of sight
And suddenly I see the future clearly
Finally I know at last
I can let go
Living the dream
Of my life
I was alone no-one in sight
This love, ill never throw it all away
Now that your in my life to stay
In the last rays of the setting sun
And the past days, that's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
There's nowhere to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
That I'll wait forever
For love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
Oh no you won't be there tomorrow
Oh no say it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
Oh, say I'm trying inside to fight
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
You know that life isn't set
I lead the pack I ain't no pretender
You give as good as you get
We live and die 'cause there's no surrender
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
You know the way that I feel
If you're with me you better hold on tighter
I'm only keeping it real
That's who I am, I'm just a non-stop fighter
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
Run out of road
The end of the days
Not for the weak
Only the brave
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
I'm chasing a dream as I go higher
I'm playing it mean, my heart's on fire
I'm living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
They never broke my will
'cause my heart was strong
They would justify
Condemnation by invitation
I will survive
Stood my ground till the end
Engaged the enemy
Protect my friends
Nostradamus, Nostradamus
Tame the beast
They send to kill
The congregation never broke my will
Nostradamus, Nostradamus
He has overcome
He can take the throne
[Chorus]
Nostradamus, dedication
Nostradamus is avenged
Nostradamus, our salvation
Nostradamus is avenged
I walked through fire to justify
Their inquisitions now condemned to die
Nostradamus, Nostradamus
Adversity on which I thrived
Destroys the alter, now I'm vilified
Nostradamus, Nostradamus
He has seized the day
He is here to stay
[Chorus]
Vindication
Ha has been avenged
They never broke my will
Cause my heart was strong
they cannot justify
i will survive
He has overpowered
This his finest hour
[Chorus]
Nostradamus
Nostradamus
Nostradamus
Nostradamus
I'm rollin' and riddin' away
'Cause I'm a reelin' and feelin' O.K.
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today  
'Cause I'm on the run
I'm rockin' and sellin' my soul
'Cause I'm livin' for rock and for roll
Forget about tomorrow
I'm shakin' all day and all night
Yeah I'm doin' that I know is right
Forget about tomorrow
Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins

Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see

This day will last forever
Deep in the hearts of men
Courage and victory
Remember, remember

One shot at glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said

One shot at glory
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire
One shot at glory

Fighting on with dignity
In life and death we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel

I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
Where would you be without music
You would be nowhere at all
We wouldn't be here doing this now
If you weren't having a ball
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Not even the pink or white noise
Well thankfully we've got the license
To have us some fun with the boys
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way
The melody line's fascinating
The rhythm is something divine
It sends our adrenaline racing
To see you all moving so fine
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way
One for the road
I am your darkest hour
I am your fall from power
I am the voice you dread and I'm
Screaming out inside your head
I am the final count
I am your demons out
I am the worst demise
I'm gonna cut your big words down to size
What is this?
I hear you shout
Face to face
I'm gonna take you out
One on one, bring it on
One on one, take me on
I am the awful truth
I am the fearless youth
I am the cross to bear
And the one who dares to return your stare
I am the fist of God
I am the underdog
I'll always stand my ground
While the others scatter all around
Against all odds
Despite it all
I'm at my best when I'm against the wall
One on one, bring it on
One on one, take me on
I am the bloodstained past at last
That's finally caught up with you like
The glint of steel from out of the dark the last
Thing you will feel - I'm outgunned, I'm out
Run, I'm undead and then I found the skin
You shed I am the questions asked
That send the shivers down your back
So I am holding out
And I'm much stronger now
So take me on
One on one, bring it on
One on one, take me on
I am the darkest night
I am the viper's strike
I'll see you all consumed
As you start to lick your mortal wounds
Like the condemned man
Who just won't die
I'll show no remorse
I'll never walk away
One on one, bring it on
One on one, take me on
I'm layin' awake at night
I can't get you out of my mind
All I can hear is my heart beat
And a voice in the dark of some kind
Where are you now
The fears are comin' back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Takin' good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold
Out in the cold
Hear me calling
Cold
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
I know it was you I hurt
I didn't mean to hurt you
So much to forgive and forget
Can't take anymore of this hurt
On no, Oh no
There's so many things I regret
Where are you now
The fears are comin' back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Takin' good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold
Shut me out
Out in the cold
Where are you now
Hear me calling
I need you I'm so cold
Can't you hear my heart beat
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
Give me a chance baby
There's nothing I wouldn't do to make it alright
Just for one more chance baby
I need all your lovin' tonight
Where are you now
The fears are comin' back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Takin' good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold
Shut me out

Out in the cold
Please rescue me
I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have ta go
I've heard the rumors and it seems they're comin' true
You do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new
Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through
How I suffer for your love
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messin' round, practice what you preach
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like
Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He is half man and half machine
Rides the metal monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A savior comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds if thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
Faster then a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
Wings of steel painkiller
Deadly wheels painkiller
He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!
Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!
Can't stop the painkiller
Pain (pain)
You say I waste my life away, but I live it to the full
And how would you know anyway, you're just mister dull
Why don't you get into the things we do today
You could lose twenty years right away, so we say
We don't need, no, no no no parental guidance here
Every day you scream at me to turn the music low
Well if you keep on screaming, you'll make me deaf you know
You always chew me out, because I stay out late
Until your three-piece suit comes back in date, get one thing straight
There's no communication
I'm tired of explanation
Is this message getting through
You went through the same thing too
Don't you remember what it's like to lose control
Put on my jacket - for you get too old
Let's rock n' roll
Swerving through the street
Drunk as fuck
Searching for a open store
I think I'm out of luck
Maybe I'll find a mad mother on patrol
Hit her car
Smash it up
Pull her out
Beat her up
Take her money
Run her down
Can't find any beer
It's way past two
There's just one thing
We can do
Hit her car
Smash it up
Pull her out
Beat her up
Take her money
Run her down
Drive her face out of town
Drunk drivers against mad mothers
Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead cold flesh pacifies the means
Provocative images delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon
[Chorus]
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants
In the depths of a mind insane
Fantasy and reality are the same
Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead warm flesh pacifies the means
Incised members ornaments on my being
Adulating the skin before me
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants
[Chorus]
Death's pointed at your head
Your mind on the trigger pull it
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
Scene of your rage
Death is not strange
Blood on the walls
You stand alone satisfied
	
I'll wake the silence in you
I'll shoot the violence through you
Terrified by the thought that you are all alone
Paralyzed by the fact that you are not alone
You're losing your mind, I'm losing control
You're losing your mind, as I bury your world
I'll wake the silence in you
I'll shoot the violence through you
I can't remember yet someone always seems to die
You are the reason why I became the chosen one
I've got the right
God makes no sense
I've got the right
I feel my back against the wall
Death's pointed at your head
Your mind on the trigger pull it
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story
Scene of my rage
Scene of my rage
Death is your name
You're facing your grave
I taste your tears caress your face
I watch you lie insane
Dying for love
Praying to die
I want what's inside you
Dressed in your blood
You wear it well
Dying because I care
Your eyes are wide but you can't see
Rotting my lust away
I'll shoot the violence through you
And wake the part that's dead
I hate the silence in you
I want what's in your head
No one could ever doubt my rapture
As you too will soon discover
No one will ever cross my love
Deadly consequence will rise above
Lying all alone
Visions of erotic bliss
Feel your warmth from inside your skin
A fever I can not resist
Desire I would kill for you
Right or wrong I'd do anything
True and pure the intensity
Every time death is next to me
Lying all alone
Visions of erotic bliss
Feel your warmth from inside your skin
A fever I can not resist
Anxiously feeling grotesque
Up against your flesh
Forbidden fantasies
Uncontrollable heat
Find yourself all alone and dead
Visions of corroding bliss
Feel the warmth from inside your skin
A sensation I can't resist
I embrace the darkness within
Forever serve beneath its hand
Horrid thoughts that surface to me
Ceremony bloods command
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
As you kneel before its evil
Death is here deep inside your 
Skinned alive now naked
Terrorized no humanity
Seek salvation from an mia god
Empty vessels chanting for your death 
Walk the streets beneath the shadows
Searching for a cryptic bride
Eat alive the conscience I hate
Without pain I watch you die
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
As you kneel before its evil
My face is the last you'll see 
Soaked in blood the mask you wear
Haunting cries the dead scream for me
Staring eyes invoke no guilt
I can taste your mind your lifeless 
Face the dead and dying
Feel your life drain
Through your soul
Seek salvation from an M-I-A god
Empty vessels chanting for the dead 
Death is yours
Your veins have dried
Staring eyes of glass now empty
Still you speak with lips so cold
In my head I hear you cry 
God is dead can't save me
Taking lives with impunity
Resurrection of a deviant Christ
Feeding hate to capacity - deviance
Live by the sword and help to contain 
The helpless minds of you all 
Die by my hand in pools of blood 
Clutch yourself as you fall 
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims 
Children slaughtered in vain 
Raping the maids, in which they serve 
Only the words of the 
Lord 
Die by the sword
Die by the sword 
Satan watches all of us 
Smiles as some do his bidding
Try to escape the grasp of my hand 
And your life will no longer exist 
Hear our cry, save us from 
The Hell in which we live 
We turn our heads toward the sky 
And listen for the steel 
Die by the sword 
Die by the sword 
Watch as flowers decay 
On the cryptic life that died 
The wisdom of the wizards
Is only a neurtured lie 
Black knights of 
Hell's domain 
Walk upon the dead
Satanas sits upon 
The blood on which he feeds 
Die by the sword 
Die by the sword
Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
I'll instigate I'll free your mind
I'll show you what I've known all this time 
God hates us all, God hates us all
You know it's true God hates this place
You know it's true he hates this race 
Homicide-suicide
Hate heals, you should try it sometime
Strive for peace with acts of war
The beauty of death we all adore
I have no faith distracting me
I know why your prayers will never be answered 
God hates us all, God hates us all
God hates us all, God hates us all
Yeah, he fuckin' hates me 
Pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
Global chaos feeding on hysteria
Cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game
Drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies 
I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow 
Man made virus infecting the world
Self-destruct human time bomb
What if there is no God would you think the fuckin' same
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
Wake the fuck up can't ignore what I say
I got my own philosophy 
I hate everyone equally
You can't tear that out of me
No segregation separation
Just me in my world of enemies 
I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow
I'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple 
I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place
I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place
I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place
I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place

Disorder!!! [Repeat x8]
Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin
This fucking country's lost its grip
Subconscious hold begins to slip
The scales of justice tend to tip
The legal system has no spine
It's corroding from inside
Slap your hand you'll do no time
Reality on vacation
All across a blinded nation
Mentality under sedation
Anyone can be set free
On a technicality
Explain the law again to me
Here in 1994
Things are different than before
Violence is what we adore
Invitation to the game
Guns and blades and media fame
Every day more of the same
Murder, mayhem, anarchy
Now are all done legally
Mastermind your killing spree
Unafraid of punishment
With a passive government
There's nothing for you to regret
Nothing to regret
Unimposing policy
No enforcing ministry
Gaping with judicial flaws
Watching a fading nation crawl
Clashing with the public's frame
I'm the one that's place in fame
Legislature sets the stage
Social slaves caught in my rage
Administrative anarchy there's nothing
You can do to me
The world around you drifting to a
Continental tomb you see
Violence is my passion
I will never be contained
Living with aggression and its
Everlasting reign
Awaken
In a web like hell
How did "I reach this place
Why are they haunting me
I cannot look at God's face
Paralyzing
Brilliant light
Trying to run
Want to scream but cannot speak
I cannot look at God's face
Blind my eyes I can't see
What is being done to me
In my mind only pain
All the memories are drained
Victimized
Specimen
Deathless torture
Void with no mercy
Black shroud binds those who see
Violated
Naked before you I stand
Shattered shrine of flesh and bone
God's piercing through my soul
Segments of my life
Morbid pieces of reality
Twisted personality
Many faces yet faceless
Familiar things give way to strange
No mercy no reason but pain
Fatal
Subconscious control
Threshold of pain unfolds
Transfixed martyr saving race
Who am I to judge thy grace
Awaken
In a web like hell
How did I reach this place
Why are they haunting me
I cannot look at God's face
Breeding fast in poverty
Infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate
Left in charge to dominate
Waiting to unfold
Raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine, infest my corpse to be
 
Unyielding kings of agony
Test your body chemistry
Pulmonary overthrow
Possession of your inner throne
Invasions quickly override, malicious domineering strike
Flood your veins commit slow death
Deteriorate your makers met
 
Perpetual demise
On a fast decline
Killing tendency
Epidemic, permanent disease
Incapacitate, fall into your fate
Pain results in screams, bleed internally
Years will pass before it can be cured
Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer then move on ahead

Evil
My words defy
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds

Satan our master in evil mayhem
Guides us with every first step
Our axes are growing with power and fury
Soon there'll be nothingness left
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with God's angel and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can

Evil
My words defy
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds
Even though some things are better left unsaid
There's a few things I need to get off my chest
I need to vent, let me tell you why
I'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive
You leave me no hope, no life
Nothing worth living for
I've taken it, can't take it anymore
My worst nightmare
You make me want to slit my own fucking throat
Just so I'll be rid of you
Just to get rid of you
You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out
My hate is contagious; you've got no one to run to
Exile!
Just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue
Your opinion is always senseless, fuck this
You make my fucking skin crawl
I've lived with it, can't stand anymore
My worst nightmare
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you, every time I think of you
You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out
My hate is contagious
Anyone else need to vent?
You've tried my tolerance; I just want you to die
There's nothing more for me to say
There's nothing more for you to say
There's nothing more for us to say
I fucking hate you anyway
Exile!
Can't count the ways that you light my fuckin' fuse
I can't tolerate the sight of you, the thought of you or
Anything about you
You know what I want to see?
How many ways can a loser fucking lose
I know you'll find a way
The humility awakening the idiot inside
You spineless fucking maggot, you're just wasting my time
Get out of my face, Get out of my life
Out of my fucking way, Just die
Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf my battlefield
In no one's way caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill
[Chorus]
Expendable youths
Fighting for possession
Having control the principle obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death the only solution
Inured soul lies on the ground
Head blown off face down
Lying in a pool of blood
An accidental death homicide
[Chorus]
Struggling to survive
The drug induced warfare
To have control and principle obsession
Expendable youth fighting for possession
Violence is only a friend
[Chorus]
A soldier's heart
Reflecting back at me
I keep seeing mutilated faces
Even in my dreams
Distorted images
Flashing rapidly 
Psychotically abusing me 
Devouring my brain
The eyes of the insane
On a demented campaign
Tortured spirits
Will not let me rest 
These thoughts of mutilated faces
Completely possessed
Fragmented images
Flashing rapidly 
Psychotically abusing me
Worming through my head
Shell shock battle fatigue
Overwhelming anxiety
Flashbacks panic attacks
Death raising its ugly face at me
Got to make it stop
Can't take it anymore
The dead keep haunting me
They just keep coming back for more
The eyes of the insane
On an demented campaign
Flashbacks panic attacks
Death raising his ugly face at me
Got to make it stop
Can't take it anymore
Death's face keeps haunting me
It just keeps coming back for more
Got to make it stop 
Can't take it anymore
Death's face keeps haunting me
It just keeps coming back for more
A soldier
Of misfortune
I owe my pain an suffering 
To this hell
These demons 
Ripping through my soul
Evil's relentless hostility
Won't let me sleep
Shell shop battle fatigue
Devastating insanity
Flashbacks panic attacks
Death's riding he's coming for me
Crisis feeds the lunacy
All fear the new machine
Consumed democracy returns a socialist regime
It's laid to rest without a contest
All hail the new incompetence
Masking you see what to believe
A drone in the world of anarchy
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity
Scavengers closing in
Covering the truth again
Castrate society
Fictional reality
Insecurity afraid of things you cannot see
Words become the image of the enemy
You can't dissect what was correct
Vengeance based on how things were said
Can't see your side conflicts with mine
Frustrations lead to complete demise
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity
Scavengers closing in
Covering the truth again
Every trial conspiracy
Compassion is the enemy
Paralyze, criticize
Breaking through the wall of lies
Suicidal hierarchy racing in reverse
Everything that's done today will be tomorrow's curse
Screams in my head precede your death
Can't hold the rage when the truth is shed
Blind lead the bind line after line
In a world too shallow to defy
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity
Scavengers closing in
Covering the truth again
Castrate society
Fictional reality
Metal and men clash once more to the end
Warriors above with the power to kill descend
Militia of blood troops of hate march to die
Soldiers of Hell veterans of death arise
[Chorus]
Prepare for attack
Your body will burn
Endless war
There's no return
Prepare for attack
Death will arrive
Your orders are clear
No way to hide
Fight till death
Senseless death of all mankind overtakes
Armored assassins destroy at will your escape
Children of sorrow are trampled into the grave
There is no future no [fucking] world to [be] save[d].
[Chorus]
[To reign in Hell]
Gods of steel unleash their destruction on man
Reign of death what is the final command
Scepters of hate are dropped upon the Earth
Clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth
[Chorus]
[Fight till death [Repeat x 3]]

Surrender your cloth and collar priest
There's no need for your beliefs in war
This is a place for heathens
Into that darkness fires illuminate
Grotesquely swollen by the heat
A half-burned corpse hanging naked
A stream is poisoned by the dead
In the ghostly light, debris of war
Lead us to the brink of extinction
The time has come for you now to finish it
What has man become a funeral pyre
Now that judgment's near, prepare to die
Need to suffer, lust for power
Mindless hunger never win
Final six is here, the cycle ends
I have come for you, my child
And the gift I bring is murder
Sumerian death in eastern winds
Face the father of your terror
Godless warheads wait to breathe
Set their sights on history
Distant silhouettes of the dead
Blacken face screams through the ashes
Lead us to the brink of extinction
The time has come for you now to finish it
What has man become a funeral pyre
Now that judgment's near, prepare to die
Need to suffer, lust for power
Mindless hunger never win
Final six is here, the cycle ends
Mankind owes his pain to hell
As he brings the end upon himself
Arms rising from the ashes
In the ghastly light of human flares
Berith soldiers capture souls
Shadows of human sacrifice
The return of everything that's dead
A cryptic promise from the heavens
Lead us to the brink of extinction
The time has come for you now to finish it
Dead flowers for a faceless dead
A city engulfed by the smell of the death
Bodies piled beneath the mist
Walking dead among the living
The world will bleed while horseman ride
Now that God has wept for Judas
Days are numbered, find your grave
Forever trying to escape to hell
Take a deep breath
'Cause it all starts now 
When you pull the fuckin' pin
The shrapnel burns 
As it tears into the skin
Every wonder what it takes
To be questioning your faith 
This is what it's like 
When it happens every Goddamn day
Violence is our way of life
Shards of life 
Like confetti in the air
The flesh storm grows 
As it breeds despair
You hear screams in the distance
Fighting the resistance
Not cries of war
These are just the sounds of pain
It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion
Relentless War
Killing's in style 
And it's not the main event
The cameras are whores
For the daily bloodshed
Like a junkie
Hungry for a fix of anything
The media devours
And feasts upon the inhumane
Violence is our way of life
It's all too fuckin' clear
We can never coincide
So let's all drink 
To genocide
All the venomous sights 
Border on the arcane
In times of war
Everything is bound by pain
It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion
Relentless
Warfare knows no compassion
Thrives with no evolution
Unstable minds exacerbate
Unrest in peace
There's no future
The world is dead
So save the last 
Bullet for your head
Only fallen have won
Because the fallen can't run
My vision's not obscure
For war there is no cure
So here the only law
Is men killing men 
For someone else's cause
It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion
Relentless War
Endure the pain
You know my name
I am your soul insane
I am no one
No one who cares
I am your soul despair
Your fear deceives
Vulnerability
Leaving an easy prey
Consume your mind
A power so divine
Will take you and rape you blind
Gemini master of demise
Your death is my salvation
To a kingdom mine
My lord is my light
The master of darkness
Your death is my salvation
To a kingdom mine
You look at me with eyes of fate
And see the graphic truth
Your ignorance cannot shield you 
From your naked abuse
Numbing of your moral sense 
Facing reality 
That life is unconditional
And death is only the beginning
The pain will never end...
Walking slow, breathing heavy
You could see death sweat
How it shined
An argument out of control in my mind
I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Walking slow breathing heavy
You can see death sweat. 
I am here for the sole purpose of death
Look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise
Feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart
Reflections of my soul 
Reflections of the dark
Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise.
Once forgotten soldiers come to life.
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done,
Not content with wars we never won.
 
Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn.
Rise ghosts of war.
 
Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.
Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die.
Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie.
[Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn.
Rise ghosts of war.]
I deal in pain.
All life I drain.
I dominate.
I seal your fate.
I deal in pain.
All life I drain.
Memories can't ignore,
Rise ghost of war.
God Send Death 
On your back look on to me
You'll see genocide
Face from death more than insane
Profane pleading cries
Watch you die inside watch you die 
God send death end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin a shattered faith
Down on your knees
Your screaming out to die 
Death is over due
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me 
Putrid blood flows through my veins
To thrive on demise
Voyeurs' lust watching the pain
Touching you inside
Bleed you fucking dry
Bleed on me 
Death's design blood splattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures flesh from bone
Down on your knees
Your screaming out
To die 
Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me 
Clawing at the eyes of god
You taste your death in hand
Your fingers bleed in vain
Your scream-in your grave
Clawing at the eyes of god
You pierce your throat and hands
You've gone insane with pain
Your blind screaming for your god
Pathetic god 
Death's design blood splattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures
Drown your mind in pain
I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who
You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years before I was born
[Repeat: x4]
Guilty of being white 
I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who
[Repeat: x4]
Guilty of being white 
I'm convicted
Of a racist crime
I've only served
19 years of my life
I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who
[Repeat: x3]
Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being right
High velocity bullet at close range
Can damage the mind
Shattering the skull shredding the brain
Severing the spine
Bury a round of lead in the chest
It's quite an impression
Imagine the innards of your soul
The infliction
[Chorus]
Instinctive regression
With intent to kill
No regard of human life
Or the blood spilled
Riddled convulsions
Confetti of flesh
Scattered helplessly
Losing your control of physical
Facilities
Release the slide to cleanse inside
Prepare to anoint
Snap the tongue in the groove discharge
To make my hallowed point
[Chorus]
The power of a gun
Used with conviction
Dispersed on excursions
Randomly kills its victims
My sweet revenge
Bitter in depression
The thrilling release
Of a hatred deep persuasion
The power of a gun
Used with conviction
Diffused compulsions
Unending repercussions
Violent emotion
Screaming revolution
Spasmic convulsions
Death an empty gun
What you gonna do? Time's caught up with you
Now you wait your turn, you know there's no return
Take your written rules, you join the other fools
Turn to something new, now it's killing you
First it was the bomb, Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning, you push the needle in
From life you escape, reality's that way
Colours in your mind satisfy your time
You're having a good time
But that won't last
You make a fool of things
You're living too fast
Go on and destroy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
To put the needle in, yeah
Now you know the scene, your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer see life's reality
Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin
Head starts spinning 'round, you fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave, Death's hands starts to weave
It's too late to turn, you don't want to learn
Price of life it's high, now you're gonna die!
Fear runs wild in the veins of the world
The hate turns the skies jet black
Death is assured in future plans
Why live if there's nothing there
Specters of doom await the moment
The mallet is sure and precise
Cover the crypts of all mankind
With cloven hove begone
[Chorus]
Sadistic minds
Delay the death
Of twisted life
Malicious world
The crippled youth try in dismay
To sabotage the carcass Earth
All new life must perish below
Existence now is futile
Decrepit breath, vile in its stench
A world in decay
Transgressor is as one
[Chorus]
Convulsions take the world in hand
Paralysis destroys
Nobody's out there to save us
Brutal seizure now we die
I stab you right between the eyes
You awaken from the lies
I said it ever since the inception
Where the masters of deception
I'm a godless heretic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

Like a storm that devastates
Religious power instigate
Take religion to my confession
There is no filter on my aggression
With a blister open wide
To keep the massacre alive
I got cold devastation
With my moral imperfection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

Religious death, I instigate
From what the bible demonstrates
Does it document creation
Of this hopeless infliction
Of a godless heretic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
Not a god-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

My scars insane, my life profane
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!

Open life scars, crushing open wounds
The walls of this scene will be crashing at you
You left senseless mentally unfit
Never fucking heard from you again
Never fucking heard from again
The holy cross
Symbol of lies
Intimidate the lives of Christian born
Speak of death
The words of hate
Anticipation grows amongst the dead
Hell has seen
The priests attempt
To bring forth their lord of the cross
Strike of twelve
Raise the dead
The chapel comes under attack
The ghosts of sin
Torment the priests
Their altar will soon be destroyed
Heaven's palace
Turning black
The church now belongs to the dead
Blackened magic
Infest with lust
Lucifer rules supreme
The crystal ball shows unknown fate
The last thing that's heard is the screams
Ghosts from hell invade this feeble shrine
Heaven's holy house will fall in time
Satan's morbid soldiers chant in lust
Destruction of the church we'll burn the cross
Attacking angels as they pray to god
Tormented preachers hail the twisted cross
Haunting the chapel
Hell's demons prevail
Death has come
The house of god has failed
Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown
Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord
The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved
Crucify the so called Lord
He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned your God has fell
To slave for me eternally
Hell awaits
The Reaper guard's the darkened Gates
That Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where
The Dead are free to roam
Lonely children of the night
There's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
The Lucifer controls
Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies screaming souls cry out to you
Satanic laws prevail your life is through
Pray to the moon, when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
What you seek, for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground
Now I have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
The seven bloody Gates of Hell
Is where you'll live your last
Warriors from Hell's Domain
Will bring you to your Death
The flames of Hades burning strong
Your soul shall never rest
The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved
Sacrifice the lives of all I know they soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell
And keep the fire growing deep inside
Hell awaits
I am the new hell on earth
The lord of agony divine
Domination, intimidation
Lives within these eyes
Reign of power
Remorseless anarchy
I am arrogance in the flesh
Unleashed intensity 
Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Brings you misery
The line starts here 
I am brutality the face of everlasting pain
Annihilation, Obliteration
Pulses in these veins
Sheer defiance drives my hostility
I am merciless to the core
Chaotic fury breeds 
Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Brings you misery
The line starts here 
Bring it all on
Come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm
That towers overhead
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Bringer of torture
The master is here
Everyone falls 
Here comes the pain
You're no different from the rest
Victim is your name in my vicious wasteland
Here comes the pain
Your destruction manifests
Lying there broken looking up as I still stand 
Bring it all on
Come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm
That towers overhead
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Bringer of torture
The master is here
Everyone falls
Obsessive acts of hate, abductions and massacre.
Breeding emotion subvergance, when the living become the dead
Home invasion, private party of thieves
Blood spilled, material thrill
A sign of the times 
Self-destruction, a terminal mind 
Sadomasochist a high profile, trained in apathy
Intellect repulsed, your torn, and death will have a face 
Ravage passion, a theme for the 90's
Tormented devients, when fucking becomes psychotic
Domesticated rage, actions of desperation
A struggle of inner-killing, a sign of the times 
Self-destruction, a terminal mind 
Stranggled to death, little miss beauty queen
With a fractured head, so it seems
America's little royal miss, raped of innocence
Daddy's little girl to the end 
Seduction and torture, sex of the 90's
Mass murders and random violence, when the living become the dead
Father killing mother, daughter,son suicide pact
Butchers black 24/7, a sign of the times 
Self-destruction, self destruction
A Human Disease 
Jealosy killed the queen
Sliced her neck from ear to ear
Money and power set the king free
A jury of his peers let him be 
Jealosy killed the queen
Sliced her neck from ear to ear
Money and power set the king free 
Shatter will in retribution
Life, watch it die, life ripped in half
Drastic pain a symphony, sceams
No escape your time to die
Hardened steel against your head, it weights
Self-destruct remain insane 
(repeat second verse) 
Death will have your face
You were just a waste of sperm
They way you look
Makes my stomach turn
The way you think
Is no way at all

God you really think you have balls

I hate you
Ain't it true
I hate you
And everything you do

You walk around like a fucking dick
And every time you're near
You know I get real sick

You're so stupid
There's nothing in your head
God how I wish that you were dead

I hate you
Ain't it true
I hate you
And everything you do

You were just a waste of sperm
They way you look
Makes my stomach turn
The way you think
Is no way at all
I'm all jacked up
I want you here
In my room I want you dear
And now it's time to bury my face
Between your legs
With my tongue in that special place
Now I'm gonna be your God
Now I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your God
Now I'm ready to close my eyes
To feel that warm deep throat action
Now I'm ready to make you cum
And fuck like dogs all night long
Now I'm gonna be your God
Now I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your fucking God
I'm all jacked up
I want you here
In my room
I want you dear
Now I'm ready to make you cum
And fuck like dogs all night long
I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your God
I'm gonna be your fucking God
I want to, invite you, welcome you
To my hate, to my scorn, to myself
Saturate you, infest you, betray you
Stimulate you, so eager for my lies
For my lies, lies
Lies in the name of god

I take you, I play you, invade you
Lacerate you, I scar you, innocence
Masticate you, ingest you, become you
Defenseless, I fill your emptiness
With my lies, lies
Lies in the name of god
In this world of shit I exist
Perfect world conforms I resist
Disconnect the nerves from the spine
Desecrate the walls of the mind
Through these eyes no love is alive
Through these eyes unrest never dies
Through these lies compassion is lost
Through these lies await the ungod
Antichrist is the name of god [repeat: x4]
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby,
Don't you know that I want you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey,
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand?
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land?
Please take my hand!
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby,
Don't you know that I want you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand?
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land?
Please take my hand!
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby,
Don't you know that I want you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand?
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land?
Please take my hand
Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquiescence
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone
Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above
Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away
Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure now I shall reign in blood
You go to the church, you kiss the cross
You will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality
Christianity
You spend your life just kissing ass
A trait that's grown as time has passed
You think the world will end today
You praise the Lord, it's all you say

Jesus saves, listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates
When death takes you away

For all respect you cannot lust
In an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency
Eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies
Depopulate Satanas rise
You will be an accessory
Irreverence and blasphemy

Jesus saves, no need to pray
The gates of pearl have turned to gold
It seems you've lost your way

Jesus saves, no words of praise
No promised land to take you to
There is no other way
I have witnessed your death 
I've see it many times
Your tortured screams 
Your decrypted little mind
A father's son
With pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die again for him
God won't touch what I've done
He cries upon my feet
A privilege pain
Beneath buried are your dead
On splintered bones I walk 
Sifting through the blood
Besieged in fear
Await the coming of the God
I will watch you die again for him
Blood is raining downward
The stain reflects the sun
Conquer divide within
Terrorize the mind
I have seen the end it's yours
Rosary in hand
Your selfish flesh it melts
Spilling from the sky
I will see you burn alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die
This is God's War
God's War
This is God's War 
God's War
War of holy principles
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction
Slit the throat of heaven man 
And let his blood dilute the water
Bury your dead
Fuck your God erase his name 
A lady weeps insanewith sorrow
I'll take his tower from the world 
You're fuckin' raped upon your deathbed
This is God's War
God's War
This is God's War 
God's War
Fucking Holy War
Be optimistic, happy and calm 
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity
Holy warriors
Your patience will be justified
Everything is for him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck and at all extremities
For it's a point of no return for almighty God
God will give victory to his faithful servant
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy 
The great Satan
Lurking in the dismal fog
Hungry for your blood
Seeking harmless victims
Satisfy my needs
Schizophrenic lunatic
Uncontrolled desire
Rape and ravage lady fair
Pledged to die
 
[Chorus]
No apparent motive
Just kill and kill again
Survive my brutal thrashing
I'll hunt you till the end
My life's a constant battle
The rage of many men
Homicidal maniac
 
Trapped in mortal solitude
Lift the gleaming blade
Slice her flesh to shreds
Watch the blood flow free
Hatred growing stronger
None survive my wrath
Suffer from the throbbing pain
Yield your life to me
[Chorus]
 
Kill the preacher's only son
Watch the infant die
Bodily dismemberment
Drink the purest blood
Unrelenting need to kill
Death upon you now
Anxiously awaiting
Next in line.
 
[Chorus]
(Kill again)
You know the feeling
When adrenaline takes control
Can't beat the rush
That leaves a suicidal hold
Instinct spares no one
Destroying the human heart
The taste of blood
Can rip your soul apart
Devils that drive us
Do not discriminate
A state of mind
That becomes the ultimate end
Action reaction
Blood line is not immune
To the depth of human nature
Inside of me and you
A sociopath with empty eyes
And no soul
Paranoid psychotic heart of stone
My blood runs cold
Evils of passion
Can drive reason to extremes
Love hate and murder
Temporary insanity
On the edge of a
Demented personality
Emotional
Pain is a deadly reality
A sociopath with empty eyes
And no soul
Paranoid psychotic heart of stone
My blood runs cold
A choice is made of free will
Just like the choice to kill
Decisions to lose control
My self-destructive rationale
A choice is made, made of free will
Just like the choice, the choice to kill
In the speed of a moment
Life stands still now you're standing in my killing field
A choice is made of free will
Just like the choice to kill
In the speed of a moment
Life stands still now you're standing in my killing field
Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me.
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.
Severe anguish as my body evolves.
The pain of life after death it resolves.
Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.
Madness growing as your mind dissolves.
Merely secret in my dreams.
Night grows cold, twilight's near,
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath.
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode.
Dead soul,
Stone cold,
Out into the night.
Voices inside my head
Hold me under.
Voices oppress.
Like roaring thunder.
An echo bouncing inside my brain.
How much can I take of the pain,
The pain!
A war raging deep inside my head,
A split decision that will end with me dead.
You see the agony in my eyes,
Protruding aimless,
I think it's time to die.
A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
That burns in your head.
Intense pain eats away at your brain,
Thorazine pumping through your veins.
Death walks inside you,
Smell death around you,
Hell's evil spell takes a soul,
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls.
Laughing as you eternally rot,
Searching for human flesh
And life's blood.
Live Undead.
Enter my mind can you stop the rage
No one shall mourn or pity my grave
Fighting the world without remorse
Searching for blood to never grow old
A personal hell is where I reside
Taunting death sounds cadavers in pain
Judging my soul I am not his son
Screaming God's name I want some more
[Chorus]
You love to hate me
But you won't kill me
Suicidal surge
Desensitize the world
Take what I want primordial ground
Humanity bleeds from inside my veins
Losing all grasp an evil so old
Vengeance it breeds driving you insane
Exhaust all will hanging by the neck
Anguish within let it blind the eyes
Better off dead us your epitaph
Apathy feeds the human demise
Absolute reign a malevolent mind
Conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul
Total addicting, corrupt and profane
Force-fed lies in this chapel of lust
Dancing in blood disciples enslaved
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross
[Chorus]
Pessimistic dreams
Realistic screams
Crucify creation
Magnify damnation
Enter my mind can you stop the rage
No one shall mourn or pity my grave
Fighting the world without remorse
Searching for blood to never grow old
Conceptions so vice in this bottomless soul
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross
[Chorus]
(From "South Of Heaven")
(Lyrics:Araya; Music: Hanneman, King)
 
Murder at your every foot step.
A child's toy sudden death.
Sniper blazes you through your knees
Falling down can you feel the heat,
Burn!
 
Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head.
Offspring sent out to cry,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x 4]
LEAD: HANNEMAN
Holes burn deep in your chest,
Raked by machine gun fire.
Screaming soul sent out to die,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x 4]
LEAD: HANNEMAN
 
[Spoken:]
Lying, dying, screaming in pain.
Begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain.
Mines explode, pain sheers through your brain,
Radical amputation, this is insane.
Fly swatter stakes drive through your chest.
Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest.
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath.
A vile smell, like tasting death.
Dead bodies, dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit.
Dying [in] terror,
Blood's cheap, it's everywhere.
Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line.
Bombers in flight
Trident missiles in the air
My missiles underground
Protect us till we're dead
Memories of tomorrow, crying sorrow
Push the button
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal
A bomber flying off their ramps
Nuclear bombs explode
Radio active people
Search for medicine
Pray for shelter
Kill for food
Mass starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed Cities
Mutilated bodies
Memories of tomorrow, crying sorrow
I'll kill myself
I'd rather die
If you could see in the future
You'd know why
Memories of tomorrow
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again
So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate, if I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
My smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint
My own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
My love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know
Unknown are the caverns of the mind
New realms of affliction lurk inside
Unbound massive mental energy
Your last breaths taken from you easily
Incoherence disrupts your rationale
Involuntary your last confessional
No sense of being missing segments of time
Inconsistency is feeding on your mind
Mind control, pain unfolds
I own all your sensations
Weakening, reasoning
Mesmeric full demolition
Hypnotized, victimized
Behold the threshold to the web
Scream souls fear echoes
Piercing boundaries of death
Penetration of the window to your soul
Deterioration of the mind, no self-control
Temporary comprehend no memories
Hollow carcass of a man, is all I leave
Execution but a thought in the end
Slowly erasing your life and what has been
Passing victims in the land of secrecy
Cerebral death can come to you in your dreams
You will be the lucky one
Who will see the deadly one
You will die on your knees
By the hand of Mr. Freeze
Will you see when the rest are blind
Will you remain frozen in time
Will you flee underground
Watch the blanket search the ground 
You will die on your knees
By the hand of Mr. Freeze
Horror awaits for those who evade
Ice cold blood stops in their veins
Arm yourselves to the T
Repel the threat of Mr. Freeze
See the blood drop in your eye
See your family burned alive
I don't even know you
I just know where you live
I raided your child's bedroom 
And burned his virgin skin
I crucified your nation
I left the dead rot
I parade down the street 
Carrying an iron cross
The oceans have been ripped away 
It does no good to pray
Catalysm
Men restore to cannibalism
I'm worth all you'd care for
Then I'll fuck you in the ass
I'm so fucking happy
I'll kick your face and laugh
Today's war stories
At night you can hear him scream
There's blood on your pillow
This is no bad dream
You try to think with reason
But all you can do is scream
Mortuaries, dead of night
My body starts to rise
In my mind the horror lives
To feel death deep inside
Relentless lust of rotting flesh
To thrash the tomb she lies
Heathen whore of Satan's wrath
I spit at your demise
Virgin child now drained of life
Your soul cannot be free
Not given the chance to rot in Hell
Satan's cross points to Hell
The earth I must uncover
A passion grows to feast upon
The frozen blood inside her
I feel the urge the growing need
To fuck this sinful corpse
My tasks complete the bitch's soul
Lies raped in demonic lust
Her stomach bursts the casket breaks
The seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh
The Devil's child is thrown
Hungry for the smell of Death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred
The bastard now must die
Lost souls of the dead
Form legions that burst through Hell's Gates
Death of one sacrifice
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man
The fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust
Lucifer takes my dark soul
Down to the fiery pits of Hell
(Down to the fiery pits of hell)
Holy man open up your eyes
To the ways of the world you've been so blind
As the walls of religion come crashing down
How's the ignorance taste the second time around 
Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins 
Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
Join the new faith for the celebration
Cult of new faith fuels the devastation 
Holy man come and worship me
I am all that you ever wanted to be
I'm the life of indulgence you never knew
The epitome of evil shining through 
Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins 
Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
I keep the bible in a pool of blood
So that none of its lies can affect me 
This is new faith
A different way of life
Witness the shame
See for yourself the lies
I'll take the fight
Bring it every time, any time
Refuse to let them win
My heresy begins 
Pray for life, wish for death
Pray for life, know in time you'll pray for death 
Tear it away
It lives inside your mind
Silence the fear
That keeps you pure inside
Now you can see
Life's atrocities endlessly
Witness the miracle
Witness the miracle 
Pray for life, wish for death
Pray for life, with every breath
You'll pray for death, you'll pray for death
Embrace new faith, embrace new faith
Yeah, new faith, yeah, new faith.
It's the terror that you've gotta miss
And I wanna see you right in front of death
Your eyes will shine
We're all alone and there is no noise
Step into my shadow
With no remorse
With no remorse you ain't gotta die
The loudest noise can't make me happy
Come on, bastards, feels so good
The record's coming out, baby
With no remorse I want to die
No remorse
With no remorse I wanna die
"Remain calm, I'm coming to your house to kill you"
I can't come down
No remorse
With no remorse I wanna die
What you want me to do?
What you want me to do?
No remorse 'cause I wanna die
No remorse
With no remorse I wanna die
Awake each day, to propaganda
Complacency, conformity
Relentless madness they regurgitate
So save your breath, you can't coerce the strong with verbal warfare

Defending, bludgeoning, to succumb to Christ or they will
Watch you fucking burn, these apocalyptic predators must die
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god

Replicate, like a virus that infects with disease
The beckoning pestering, don't preach to me with your blasphemy
Exterminate, the bottom dweller on your fear they prey
There's symmetry in anarchy, believe the lies or they will watch you

Fuckin' burn, these apocalyptic predators must die
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god
False god, sorcerer, free thought torturer, embedded in the mind of the masses

Outcast, conjurer, spineless provocateur, engulfed in narcissistic madness
No need to feel so hollow, a promise of no sorrow, you call him the messiah
I seek a deviant pariah

Holy water empty threat, the holy cross has no effect
I piss on any object of virtue, crucifix and rosaries
A world of insecurities, keep waiting for your soul to be rescued
You'll see no bright tomorrow, a promise of more sorrow

You call him the messiah, I see a reckless fashion based on metal slavery

You are the tainted, I am the pure, you are the sickness
I am the cure, a toxic threat of your non sense, I feed
I'll be the one to bring Christ to his knees, crucify then ridiculed again
A target for all time, until the end

I'll expose a total inconsistencies, and wallow in my heresy
Cos I am the fucking weapon, attacker of their ideology
Intoxicate with rationality, these apocalyptic predators must die
Cos I am the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god
I breach your life
Indoctrinate
Police your thoughts
Ask why I hate
I lose control
When I see your face
Abusing power
I infiltrate
Continue lies
Then masturbate
I walk the line
I'll do no time
I hate your church
I'll burn your state
A bleeding heart
A seal of fate
There is no crime
Within my mind
I'll sell your life and preach your death
A wicked plan born of contempt
Bleeding my ideology through pain
Audacious plans
I calculate
A new world view
I'll re-instate
Don't cross my path
Or I'll see you burn
You'll meet your end
Find death alone
No grave to mark
The seeds you've sown
You've pushed too far
My secrets I defend
I'll sell your life and preach your death
A wicked plan born of contempt
Bleeding my ideology through pain
Demonize what is feared profane architect
Skull and bones through the mind
Barbaric thoughts of old
Celebrate all unknown
At last the head await
The die is cast for the meek
Inherit endless dead time
Smell the victim are near
Consume the catalyst
Hunting masses for game
Implanting septic thoughts
Reaping terror through words while
Armed behind your back
Pseudo leaders betray
Enslaving all of mankind
Cast out the Demi God
Dethrone the demagogue
Cast out the church God
I command your life
And I don't care
Let bullets rain
From everywhere
No suicide
Will save you from yourself
You need to take a closer look at me
Cause I was born to be the thorn in your side
No matter what you think you're gonna see
You never wanted this barrage of fucking pride
You don't want none of me 
You've got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
When you draw first blood you can't stop this fight
For my own peace of mind, I'm going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing
Payback's a bitch motherfucker 
You only live to be a parasite
Your life must suck when nothing's going your way
Everything melts away before your eyes
You're just a punk that doesn't have the sense to get away
Get the fuck away 
You've got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
When you draw first blood you can't stop this fight
For my own peace of mind, I'm going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing
Payback's a bitch motherfucker 
I will never become your fucking scapegoat
I don't know how it feels to come up short
I only want vengeance
To come shining down on me
I don't want you to die
Before I get the chance to kill you myself 
You've got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
This is for the mind fuck
This is for the hell of it
This is for me, I'm going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing
Now you're nothing
You ain't fuckin' shit
You better learn my name
Cause I'm the one insane
And I'm a constant threat
You run in fear from my dark silhouette
Inside my violent mind
Chaos is all you'll find
Anarchy uncontained
Bear witness to the scorn of my campaign
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize
Within my world of hate
Disruption I instate
Malicious entity
Defile and desecrate humanity
Alone they all will die
Corroding from inside
With no one left to save them
As I'm dancing on the fucking graves
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize
Take a look into my mind
Where pleasure is refined
Endless burning holes
Of scarred souls
Step inside my world of hate
Where everything mutates
Your senses under siege
Ingest the virtues I feed
A higher level of pain
Is racing through my veins
There's nothing more intense
Than mental misery that I dispense
So follow right along
Observe a fresh new dawn
Of super sensation
My realm of torture stimulation
Perversions of pain
Seep from my eyes
Into your brain
Visualize
You better learn my name
Cause I'm a man insane
Inside my violent mind
Chaos is all you'll find
Within my world of hate
Disruption I instate
Alone you all will die
Corroding from inside
Follow right alone
Observe a fresh new dawn
Racing through my veins
A higher level of pain
Higher level of pain
Higher level of pain
Traitor stands within the wolves' lair
Body count now imminent
Tension will rise, the air is on fire
This nightmare will not go on
Prophecy has touched my hand
The outcome starts here and now
Raise the flag as it burns
Nation's blood will not be lost

Take the war, taste the blood
Attack and continue, never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack, continue, never, never surrender

Body hangs, piano wire plays
The music will relieve you
So delicate and lifeless now
Is innocence victorious?
Do you think I won't touch your grave?
Devotion to all insane
If war is lost you will die before I
Without dignity for all to see

Take the war, taste the blood
Attack and continue, never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack, continue, never, never surrender

Terror won't end without you, my friend
This philosophy dreams of murder
Liquidated, now painless face
Death has come no one to mourn
Who will scream when all are gone?
Not for love, for the enemy
Fanatical zeal will bring this to an end
Divine providence, the world's end

Drink the war
Piano wire plays
Your body hangs
Piano wire plays

Take the war, taste the blood
Attack and continue, never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack, never surrender
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece
 
You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny
 
As soon as life has left your corpse
I'll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see
 
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece
 
Bones and blood lie on the ground
Rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found
On my wall, your head!
 
On your trail I close the gap
One more life that soon won't be
No emotion
Your flesh is all I need
 
I'll send you to your maker
Confront the God you seek
A flash of red upon his [sings "your"] chest
Safety out of reach
 
[You have no choice of life or death
 My face you will not see
 I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
 Dismembered destiny]
[Modulistic terror
 A vast sadistic feast
 There's only one way out of here
 Piece by piece]
I never thought the taste of you
Would be the only thing to make me bleed
Why am I, so alive
While you lie still in the ground beneath me?
Fear of death the dark inside
Have become your only children
They're in front of you, watching you
Lost screams unholy dreams unrest
I laugh at your god as he's passing through
Slicing at your throat to warm my skin
Never thought it'd come to this
Fuck I've gone wrong no rest
Your children still call
Can't you hear them screaming out your name?
You've gone insane, they're in my head
They want you to, die in front of me, die in front of me
Thinking why me?
Wishing this was all a dream
Insanity, reality, you're going to
Die in front of me
Pestilence is here, death awaits, your body is not of Christ
It's my alter, helpless and alone, violate, enveloped in my skin
Faceless canvass, tearing all your flesh, bathed in blood
Violently regress, death's so endless, brutal is your pain
Anguish is a game, broken and afraid, god can't help you now
You'll wish your in hell, ghostly figures are always standing still
Are they mocking me, what do they see?
I didn't want your death to end so fast, but once you start, you cannot stop
I need it now, to fucking last, die in front of me
Die in front of me, thinking why me?
Wishing this was all a dream, insanity, reality
You're going to
Die in front of me, pestilence is here, death awaits
Your body is not of Christ
It's my alter, brutal is your pain, anguish is a game
Broken and afraid, god can't help you now
You'll wish your in hell, I never thought the taste of you
Would be the only thing to make me bleed, all alone in my
Funeral home, playing in blood there's just got to be
Something's wrong with me, draining veins, it's all the same
The torture in my head, it won't stop, until I am fucking dead
Pestilence is here, death awaits, your body is not of Christ
It's my alter, helpless and alone, violate, enveloped in my skin
Faceless canvass, tearing all your flesh, bathed in blood
Violently regress, death's so endless, brutal is your pain
Anguish is a game, broken and afraid, god can't help you now
You'll wish your in hell
I'm the one that brings you war
Infiltrate unguarded shores
Master of afflicting pain
Point is where all die
I'm the one to taste your blood
Trashing though the crimson mud
Messenger of all demise
Point is where I reign
Piercing, impaling, no judgment, just punishment
Discrete, annihilate assault with no regret
I'm the one to taste your death
Basking in your dying breath
Messenger of all demise
Point is where all die
Piercing, impaling no judgment, just punishment
Discrete, annihilate assault with no regret
Born to kill sweep and clear
Staring down the face of fear
Shrapnel flies dehumanize
Flesh and blood will fertilize
Empty all the magazines
Lethal spray from M-16's
Pace the march and sing the song
Right the fuck where I belong
Stained in blood
No fear, no sound
Penetrate your holy ground
Leave you where your comrades lie
Point is where all die
Pure destruction has begun
Fearlessly the battle's won
Spread extinction through the dawn
Signature of wrath is spawned
Minister of death unleashed
My lust for war will never cease
With no remorse I watch you die
Body count's the bottom line
Crashing slashing to the end
Your final pulse has just been spent
Leave you where your comrades lie
Point is where all fucking die
Crashing slashing to the end
Your final pulse has just been spent
Leave you where your comrades lie
Stained in blood
No fear, no pain, no life
Clouded skies rain only death
Silence all opposing threats
Quench the hunger of my gun
Exploding cities overrun
I'm the one to taste your death
Basking in your dying breath
Messenger of all demise
Point is where all die
Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck
 
Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind
 
Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live
New life born from the oppressed
 
Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near
Fatality, reality, you await the final call
 
My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever
Share insanity
 
Do you want to die!
 
The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death
Deceased in mind decree of Death
Blackened heart baptized in fire
Exertion now need to blitz
Vicious ways brought up in Hell
Draw the line Life or Death
Potent thrust excessive pain
Massive dose adrenalin
Minor threat can not decline
[Chorus]
Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of Death life's a dream
We're only living to die
Victim of life insanity lives
Deep in shock intensive care
Tables turned blast of strength
Kill at once time to prevail
Begin to crank feel the rush
Start to rage take to extremes
Push too far overkill
Time to die no way to win
[Chorus]
Running and hunting and slashing
And crushing and searching
And seeing and stabbing and shooting
And thrashing and smashing and
Burning destroying and killing
And bleeding and pleading then Death
At Mach ten velocity
Pressure builds can't take the strain
Life blood flows to its grave
Dripping sweat, Death shall erase
Time to think time to breath
Feel the pulse life will expire
Surging speed Hell afast
Cardiac cease to exist
[Chorus]
You made your choice
I'll take my stand
Your life story in my bloodstained hands

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedence

Abuse of power, civil unrest
Money in blood is of no significance
Inner rage waiting to ignite
Blood of the innocents unites

I'm right you're wrong
In number I'm strong
Violence is proof enough that I am

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedence
Martial law, a militant state
Barrel of a gun seals your fate
Fire burns with media hype
Speak the truth through your own lies

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Hate and violence
One gunshot sets the precedence
Pride in prejudice
Don't give your bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot killed the innocent

Some love to hate
Right in your face
Violence will facilitate

Fuel the fire with racial slurs
And see who kills the other first
Body count
Laying down mutilated
It's your time to die
Desolate
Lurk your satisfaction climax with your death
All alone
You're praying intimidated with my lust for fear
Dehumanize
Crying out stimulated
Your screams fill my soul
Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification!
Graphic dreams
Played out fucking sick
Can't control the urge
Innocent
Drop dead suicidal pain that I posses
Vindictive
Past crimes insidious
This is my redemption
Violate
Force down penetrate as eyes reflecting horror
Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification!
Perversion
Slow death agonizing
Stab around the eyes
Flowing blood
Will take (something) pleasure
Eclipsing our reason
Whipping burn
In high imitation
Scream for an act in vein
All of these cuts
Bled out hopelessly
Now I'm an act of rage!
Systematic death
A physical fear
Psychopathy red
After death gratification!
Anarchy, disarray this is the world today
Justice is a lie for the followers to get by
No peace, only guns, can't trust anyone
Live or die it's an eye for an eye
Unrest, marshal law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment
Blameless innocent, lies of the decadent
Brazen hypocrites answering to idiots
New tax, market crash, high life never lasts
No quick fix, for broken politics
Unrest, marshal law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment
Aftermath of tolerance judgment is defined
Individual pain is a strong incentive
Infiltrate with fear keeping penance ever near
Punish with indecency and mutilate for all to see
Disarray, no quick fix, for broken politics
Anarchy, live or die it's an eye for an eye
Unrest, marshal law, society decays
And it's safe to say there is no other way
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents
Public display of dismemberment
Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquiescence
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone
Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above
Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away
Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure now I shall reign in blood
Evangelist you claim God speaks through you,
Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity.
You care not for the old that suffer,
When empty pockets cry from hunger.

Penniless from their generosity,
Sharing their money to quench your greed.
Searching for the answer to their prayers
They cry their last wish of need.
Save me.

His spirit lives and breathes in me.
The almighty transformed to your screen.
The meanings lost in its translation,
No holy words, describe his deception.

You say you'll help us find the lord,
Tell me preacher how do you know
A simple quest for a visible savior,
To lead us through our final prayer.
Save me.

Send your donations,
Contribute to the cause.
Luxuries,
Your righteous reward?

Praise the lord, praise god,
Is what you wish to sell.
There is no heaven without a hell.

In your mind's eye could you truly believe,
That by giving you can save your soul,
Could you be so naive!
You heal the sick,[you] raise the dead,
You blind the congregation
With the things you say.

Religious blackmail a deceit of trust,
That death will come and all will be lost.

Can you hear the serpents call,
Look deep in those deceiving eyes.
Ignore the writing on the wall,
You should read between the lies.

When doubt subsides his honesty,
An inquiry, is it blasphemy?
Impure the soul, that's made to suffer,
No sermons left to hide or cover,
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled,
To steal a dream or get it killed.
They claim your trip to heavens nearby,
You may believe it but Satan wouldn't lie.
Convicted witch my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured by lock inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
The shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time
 
Incantation spell gone by
I will see life again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there is no end
I will be reborn
 
No gift of exile in my fate
I'll get no amnesty
You can't control my destiny
There is no habitual need
Proclaim my death, to end my wrath
It takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse
I will never die
 
You think by killing me tonight
My powers will not rise
There'll be nowhere for you to run
When my hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy
Allowing no first born
Defy your morbid declaration
Leave you ripped and torn
Count your blessing would be priest
As I burn upon the stake
You'd be forgiven endlessly
But your values are all fake
Forever servant of my Lord
By choice and not submission
Maybe now I've made you wonder
Am I superstition
Incantation spell gone by
I will live again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book in red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing there is no end
I will be reborn
Needles stabbed into the walls
The executioners curtain call
Fighting back he found his life drowning
And there was no way up

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With slashing, and stabbing, and manning and ramming

Death room with black curtains
Where his clothes once laid
The roof kicked out and the rope tied to the rafters
A quick kick of the chair
And it's all through
If Richie only knew

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With needles, injecting and shooting himself contagiously

His life suddenly flashed right before his eyes
What a swinging guy
Turning gray with mold
This is when he died

Give it up give up
Throw it all away

Burning acid bath
Pulmonary wrath
Feel the boiling surge
It won't let you go


Throw it all away [Repeat x2]
Throw it all a  [Repeat x2]
Throw it all away

Swinging in his room
Richie won't come out to play
That poor bastard hung himself the other day
Oh how the years seem to fly by
Is death the final high

Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
It happened the other day
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he find a better way
With slashing and stabbing and ripping
And stabbing and shredding and slashing
And shredding and stabbing and ripping
And tearing attacking and manning
And taking the body god gave to you

I gotta get out

Cause Richard hung himself
Cause Richard swung himself
Cause Richard strung himself
The needles stung himself
It pulled him off the shelf
Cause Richard hung himself
Ancient crown placed on your head

Seven keys to the chamber
Surrendered to the God

Killing whore
Wade through blood
And spill some more

Atmosphere of deadly terror
Subservient to all

Burning sense of mission
Assassination
Symbol of oppression
Crusade led from exile
Obliteration
Sabotaged campaign
Check resistance from afar
Planning the death of one
When the plot is executed
There will be nowhere to run
Ramifications will be high
A price paid in torment
The end justifies the means
To hell you will be sent
The wolf leader now is the stalked
Expansion state of horror
Guns echo over the grave
A thousand fates are sealed
Murderous power brought to an end
Only to rise again
Cold and restless and iron will
Protectorate of the dead
A thorough sweep
Prelude to death
Secrets kept
But no one left
Firing squad
Begins their work
Harsh reprisal
For what you took
Retribution selective terror
The stench of death is everywhere
A severed head
A floating mass
Will give me answers to what I ask
I stalk close in from above
Silent wings will test your faith
Death will never hear me pass
Launch attack you're too late
I hear flak inside my head
Deafening thunder cities burn
Carpet-bombing laid to waste
Throwned inside a death mask
Holy cross embedded in your tomb
Casualties are buried through your mind
Certain death is screaming from the sky
I live to destroy below
Hunted victims are unseen
Flying wrath a fortress hell
War machine to kill all
I leave carnage in my wake
Choking bleeding for your life
Faceless prey has been erased
Silence reigns you're dead now
Holy cross embedded in your tomb
Casualties are buried through your mind
Certain death is screaming from the sky
Listen to the rhythm of a dead man walking
Silent is the heartbeat of the predator stalking
Hear the sound of air feel the warmth touch your neck
Reality is not fair no time to second guess
Hear the distant ringing of the blade as it cuts through your neck
Silent is the cry lying on your mattress of blood
An easy mark for a veteran of execution
I walk step by step with death
Where all bludgeoned bodies lie
You will see my face of rage
Cut your heart out of your chest
Leave impaled the consummation of mankind
No blood no glory
All pain and fury
A demonstration
Of domination
Show of pure intimidation
Full contact why I live and breathe
Side stepping all the human debris
Head strong I know that I'll prevail
Face down in my arena you will fall
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory
Base line goal lie
Overtime killing time
Relentless brotherhood of disciple
Centuries of traditions is to win
Head first into battle feel the rush
Living on adrenaline your try is crushed
No blood no glory
All pain and fury
Head to head eye to eye
Human pile of proven pride
Ripping flesh spitting teeth
Sacrifice for victory
Base line goal line
Overtime killing time
Razors edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration
Close your eyes 
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself a
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane, insane
Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
Close your eyes and forget your name
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane, insane
Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated eviscerated
Times prostrated
Let me take you down without a sound
Dead before you hit the ground
Blood washes my hand can't understand
Sterilizing my pain
Washed away with crimson tide
By my hand I keep testing time
Quench the fire that drives my soul
Soothing me as death takes hold
Peaceful and serene slowly bleeding
Eyes once bright are now fading
Pallid ashen face against my skin
Staring blindly at some distant place
Washed away by crimson tide
By my hand I keep testing time
Straight flesh lace adorns your neck
Spilling your blood all over my flesh
Quench the fire that drives my soul
Soothing me as death takes hold
Divine godsend enveloping me
Spiritual ecstasy sets me free
I saw them all around today
They don't stop they won't go away
They love the darkness in my eyes
Help me find a way out when I'm lost within myself 
They show me everything I need
There's nothing wrong with a little greed
Never enough to satisfy
Such a driving desire that burns inside 
My life came with it's own scars
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
I can't say I've seen it all
But I live for the things that keep me hollow 
Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me 
They all look like me
I never see them coming
But they show me more of myself
Drawn into the depths
I never knew existed
Launching me face first
Into the pleasures of pure lust and greed
I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of
Everything 
My Life came with it's own scars
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
I can't say I've seen it all
But I live for the things that keep me hollow 
Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me
They all look like me 
I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of
Everything
Caught, now you're mine
I am the master of your whipping time
The smile on my lips
The look of horror on your face
Self justification
Can't rid the sexual fascination
Can you deny
My face of pleasure, the gleam in my eye
[Chorus:]
You're nothing
An object of animation
A subjective mannequin
Beaten into submission
Raping again and again
Shackled, my princess
Dangling in distress
Here to discipline
My sole purpose never ends
Bleeding on your knees
My satisfaction is what I need
The urge to take my fist
And violate every orifice
[Chorus]
Slaves to my torments
Scream to your heart's content
Time and time again
Pleasure in inflicting pain
Power so intense
Trying to circumvent
Unadulterated battery
Manipulated reality
God is dead I am alive
Through the night we rise in pairs
Lords at night we ride
From the depths of Hell's domain
Reborn to reign this night
Roam throughout the endless wars
Hold high his name we must
Warriors from the gates of Hell
In Lord Satan we trust
[Chorus]
Stalking the night can't you feel I'm near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing my force
Brothers of the Prince of Night
By bargains we have made
Allies with the darkened souls
Our legions we must save
Fight for our eternal quest
God can't save you in time
Evil stalks the night with us
Your soul it shall be mine
[Chorus]
I am the menace in your eyes
The one you can't escape
Your life falls in my grasp
Your know your end is near
You pray your God will help
His strength no match for mine
Your last hope slips away
Thy soul begins to bleed
I tear your flesh to shreds
Burn holes throughout your mind
Your eyes now filled with blood
A victim of my force
In endless agony
You realize your defeat
Recite my Master's chants
Your soul now his to keep
Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.
Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.
Guidance, it means nothing 
In a world of brutal time.
Electric, circus, wild,
Deep in the infants mind.
 
Silent Scream
Bury the unwanted child.
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn.
 
Shattered, adolescent [sings: another child]
Bearer of no name.
Restrained, insane games
Suffer the children condemned.
Scattered, remnants of life,
Murder a time to die.
Pain, sufferaged toyed,
Life's little fragments destroyed.
 
Silent Scream
Crucify the bastard son.
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn.
Life preordained
Humanity maintained.
Extraction termination
Pain's agonizing stain.
Embryonic death,
Embedded in your brain.
Suffocation, strangulation,
Death is fucking you insane.
 
Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.
Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.
Innocence withdrawn in fear.
Fires burning can you hear
Cries in the night.
Unbound God's creation
Has grown into the sinner
Abandoned innocence
Impenitent transgressor
Escape mortality
They say your life can change
If you take God's hand
Embrace rebirth
Your cleansing's so divine
To be reborn in God's eyes
You'll never touch God's hand
You'll never taste God's breath
Because you'll never see the second coming 
Life's too short to be focused on insanity
I've seen the ways of God
I'll take the devil any day
Hail Satan
Your faith has atrophied
And rots in hell's asylum 
Despondence tears you down
A free-falling social strain
Escape atrocity
They say your life can change
If you take God's hand
Embrace rebirth
Your cleansing's so divine
To be reborn to God's lies
You'll never touch God's hand
You'll never taste God's breath
Because you'll never see the second coming 
It's all a fuckin' mockery
No grasp upon reality
It's mind control for 
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ
You'll never touch God's hand
You'll never taste God's breath
Because you'll never see the second coming 
I laugh at the abortion known as Christianity
I've seen the ways of God
I'll take the devil any day
Hail Satan
You'll never touch God's hand
You'll never taste God's breath
Because you'll never see the second coming 
It's all a fuckin' mockery
No grasp upon reality 
It's mind control for
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ
Start with vanity
Arrogance and greed
Panic is my obsession
No one can escape
The thrill is much too great
Despair is my creation
Everything obscene
Emanates from me
Homicide is on the rise
It all begins now
Take your final bow
The camera never lies
Action, torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony
Captured for eternity
Action
You're the main attraction
Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny
No one else around
Razor wire bound
Insanity is so near
Heart begins to seize
Watch you atrophy
Reality is now clear
Take a look inside
Many more have died
The internet's an open door
Everyone can see
Dying brutally
The audience begs for more
Action, torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony
Captured for eternity
Action
You're the main attraction
Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny
Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny
Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time.
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.
Judgment day the second coming arrives.
Before you see the light you must die.

Forgotten children, conform a new faith,
Avidity and lust controlled by hate.
[The] Never ending search for your shattered sanity,
Souls of Damnation in their own reality.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters,
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.
Engreat souls condemned for all eternity,
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive sabbath.

On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.
A force that has lived all eternity.
A never ending search for a truth never told.
The loss of all hope and your dignity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.

On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
Come walk with me through endless time
See what has been and what the future sees
Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed
Step in a life that's yet to be born

You spill the blood
Eternal soul

I'll show you sights that you would not believe
Experience pleasures thought unobtained
At one with evil that has ruled before
Now smell the stench of immortality

You spill the blood
Eternal soul

Spill your blood, Let it run on to me
Take my hand and let go of your life
Close your eyes and see what is me
Raise the chalice, Embarce for evermore

You've spilt the blood
I have your soul
Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
As past or present words to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity

Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the journey's end

Spirits damned to rot
Amidst the brimstone fireballs
Eyes of the dead
Watching from their living walls
Broken glass reflections
Show your flesh eaten away
Beyond the gates I 'll take you
Where the blood forever rains

Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the journey's end

Afterlife confessions
Tell me who you used to be
Looking on in wonder
As I show you it was me
Burning from within
You know one spark is all it takes
Hear the piercing cries of all
Who found that hell awaits

Living nightmare can't you see
You really have no choice
Faded memories haunt you
Listen clearly to my voice
Feed me all your hatred
Empty all your thoughts to me
I can fill your emptiness
With immortality

Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
As past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity
Imagine Humanity's decline
Step inside my stain of mind
Infesting superiority
Infectious immorality oh yea
Come worship the place no truths are told
Praise the land where sins are sold
No passion no love your faith evades
Never see yourself again that way
Death becomes your bride
Lifelessness invades your eyes
in fire baptized
All pain sifts through my soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest stain of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes
As one the collective unifies
Emanate a faithless shine
Forever creation has conceived
Birth of destruction spreads its wings oh yea
Chaotic rebirth a  new domain
Re-live the sight the sound the pain
Erotic the taste of agony
Adorn the scars of inhumanity
This is what you see
Deep inside of me
Agony is life
Lechery is life
Godlessness is life
Purgatory magnified
In fire baptized
All pain sifts through my soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest satin of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes
Enticing malevolence allures
Bastardize the clean and pure
Salvation forever crucified
I choose the other side oh yea
Entire, complete serenity
Injected intravenously
Transgression euphoric bliss divine
Initiate a timeless stain of mind
Blood will sterilize
In fire I baptized
All pain sifts through my soul
You'll never feel greater misery
Master of my enemy
Let the purest stain of mind
Wash the virtue from your eyes
Crushing all your worthless goals
I define control
Your pain's my fucking ecstasy
So putrid is my world of tyranny

Accentuate your desperation
Flesh from bone, I'll rip and tear
I hate the fact
That we breathe the same air

Helpless, as I dominate
I won't celebrate
Until you've all been crucified
I can not rest 'til everyone has died

I can't stand the victim in you
Infecting everything that I do

I will eradicate
Obliterate, depopulate
Divine, atrocious suffering
Cleansation of the weak, supremacy

Pissing on your faith
Incinerate God's whore
Perpetual is my reign
I will eat your soul

Must maintain control of the weak

Must maintain control of the weak
Must contain the minds of the free
Must maintain control of the weak
Must contain the minds of the free
Must maintain control of the weak
Voice is a weapon, bombs are away
Mind's a trigger, fire away
World's in a crossfire, of panic and fear
The war is upon us, I say it starts here

We will take control
Of this abortion called society
I despise the mediocrity
Inject the system with something new
A social terror to lead the few

Why call it the land of the free?
Political banter if you ask me
Diffusing a problem, the question is how
With imminent conflict, the answer starts now

I can say
We're not the answer to the world's decay
Here to say
We're just the ones who won't go away

We will take control
Of this disaster called society
I despise the mediocrity
So now I'm going to introduce
A social terror that's on the loose

I am the propaganda war machine
The face of fury and obscenity
So when society has gone astray
I'll be the one to pave the way
They'll never fuck with my reality
'Cause this right here to me is unity
When all is done we'll have always shown
A domination that was never known

We will take control
Of this abortion called society
I despise the mediocrity
We are the torch that lights the fuse
A social terror with nothing to lose
Have you ever felt the need
To see more than you can see
Look into uncertainty
Reflections of treachery
Would you leave the world behind
Endless life is here to find
Can I interest you in lies
Sell your soul for all it buys
[Chorus:]
Play with your insanity
Shatter your reality
Pulsing in your blood
I can satisfy your greed
For now all your debts are free
I have all eternity 
To quench all the death I breed
Recreate the rules of play
From now things are done my way
None have ever won my game
Crucified them all in flames
Have you ever danced with the devil
His temptation ever summoned you
Ever penned your name in blood
Let possession slowly swallow you
When you stand under full moonlight
The attraction mesmerizes you
Have you ever wondered why
It seems that evil you're attracted to
Reach out to my hand
Step back in time's sand
Genetic wasteland
Far beyond death
Screams and nightmares
Of a life I want
Can't see living this lie no
A world I haunt
You've lost all control of my
Heart and soul
Satan holds my future
Watch it unfold
I am the Antichrist
It's what I was meant to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free
Watching disciples
Of the satanic rule
Pentagram of blood
Holds the jackal's truth
Searching for the answer
Christ hasn't come
Awaiting the final moment
The birth of Satan's son
Screams,
From a life I live
Torment,
Is what I give
Torture,
Is what I love
The down fall,
Of the heavens above
I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rot
Screams of terror across the sea
Begging for mercy in their one final plea
Soldiers prepare to fight to the death
Fighting and killing to their very last breath
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
He makes his move to conquer the land
Turning all hopes of life to sand
[Chorus]
Machine gun fire, blood level higher
Visions of torture and terror to all
Ready for battle awaiting the final command
Hiding in darkness from enemies unseen
Awaiting our victory ending his dream
Cursed are the souls who defy his will
All of which are tortured and ruthlessly killed
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
Shocking the world with his mass devastation
He puts all his power in the trust of one nation
[Chorus]
At the crack of dawn they storm again
Hunting, fighting and killing all men
The end is near our time now short
Our kingdoms have fallen as a result of his sport
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
Withdrawn from fighting he now takes his leave
Seeking out goals that can't be conceived
[Chorus]
I don't want to see, I don't want to hear
I don't want to feel anything can't you understand
Everything I do doesn't stem from you
It doesn't have a fucking thing to do with you
I just want to die throw it all away
Never have to feel again the way you make me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take it
I can't control the rage that flows from me
I can't shut it down it overwhelms me
I can't stop the rage that flows from me
Can't stop the
Violence I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else 
You're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
It's my discipline it's my way of life 
Never wanted bliss never wanted you
Never needed anyone I've polluted
Everything you feel everything you are
Everything you'll ever be you repulse me
It's always about you always come at me
With shit I can't identify you know it makes me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take it
Can't stop the
Violence I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else you're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
It's my discipline it's my way of life
Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Hoping for relief
From the fear you feel inside
Losing all perspective
Of reality in the night
[Chorus]
Running from shadows
Blinded by fear
The horror of nightfall
Is ever so near
I slowly surround you
As terror sets in
Are you afraid of the night
I see the fright in your eyes
As you turn and run
But is your mind playing tricks
On a body so very young
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine
[Chorus]
Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine
I know you're mine
Too late to hide
Too late to save your life
Tormentor
Use the need, lose control,
Hidden voice inviting,
Imposing will, unconscious skill
Embraced immoral passion.
Born is still, thirst for thrill,
Indulgence of illusion.
Neurotic, psychotic,
Dead silent screams, come alive. 
Killing seed, first degree,
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide. 
A final thrill, a timely kill
Unbound, unguarded.
Fantasized, realized,
Enforced upon the dying.
Free reign of the asylum,
Archaic energy thrives,
Dead cold, I control
Eternal screams that slowly die. 
Killing spree, first degree.
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide. 
Dimentia born of sin,
A symptom that begins,
Vengeance so divine. 
Lost my grip of what's real.
Unrestrained self-induced vertigo.
Manic power chills my spine.
I can't erase this instinct I embrace. 
Two faced moral abandon,
Races my blood boils my skin.
Unhinging the doorway to this asylum,
Releasing unshackled poison dreams.
Beginning the end of temptation.
A vengeance so divine.
The end of temptation,
A vengeance so divine. 
Killing spree, first degree,
I shut the world outside.
Denied and laid to waste,
The body and soul divide.
I am the last of the dying insane
You would scream at the things I've done
Knowing that the dead still see
My blood it runs like mercury
Your last breath the sword comes down
She dies first speaking death to me
Philosophy, the vision, the view within
Duty, science, abstract cruelty
[Chorus]
What are your final thoughts?
Do you want to kill me or die in shame?
From my point of view
Justified action, the enemy burns
The fun of massacre in the brain
Bio-weapons and I are the same
Look at their face, hatred in their blood
Pile up the dead, my humanity
X-rays burn all that you can see
Nobody knows what a body can stand
Skulls on fire yet mercy is worse
You seek only your pleasure in death
[Chorus]
Bacterial target, eyes exploding
Melting flesh through your mind
Become your madness insanity wins
Infant's flesh on the walls
Testing limits threshold of pain
Ripping out teeth to observe
I want blood
[Repeat: x4]
Knowing now the dead still see
My blood it runs like mercury
Human brain experiment
On prisoners open skull
Vivisection, live dissection
Repulsing to the core
[Chorus]
Fuckin' burns
Pathogens seek horrible end
Churning factories of death
Crematoriums see your crime
You will see me in hell
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again
So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate, if I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
My smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint
My own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
My love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know
Stop and think of society's impotence
And the reason behind its incompetence
Faith in God is the vice, bring on the tyranny
Won't be long 'til you find the real irony

Life drags on and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high

Politician that claims to be the innocent
Sells you peace then defies you with his insolence
Greed and power his vices give him what he seeks
Manipulate and divide forever lead the weak

Life drags on and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high

You've been powerless to your vices
Self-control defies you
When nothing else quite suffices
Your demons will destroy you

Holy man portrays the face of purity
Hiding behind as shroud of vanity
Pure lust is his vice a sickness to defile
God becomes a device to hide the pedophile

Life drags on and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high

So fuckin' high
Let's get high
Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night
In blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy
The reason for the singe
The pendulum it shaves the blade
The strafing air blood raid
infiltration push reserves
Encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds
Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph
The number that are dead
[Chorus: x2]
Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When victory's a massacre
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill
Be dead friend from above
When darkness falls
Descend into my sights
Your fallen walls
Spearhead break through the lines
Flanked all around
Soldiers of attrition
Forward their ground
Regime prophetic age
Old in its time
Flowing veins run on through
Deep in the Rhine
Center of the web
All battles scored
What is our war crimes
(Era forever more...war)
Propaganda war ensemble
Burial to be
Bones shining in the night
In blood laced misery
Campaign of elimination
Twisted psychology
When victory is to survive
And death is defeat
Sport the war, war support
The sport is total war
When victory's a massacre
When victory is survival
When this end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill
Explosive you feel the impact hit your face
What makes you think I'll let you survive
You want a war I'm the front line
Unbroken

This ain't about me
I'm better than you'll ever be
You don't concern me

As long as my heart still beats

Fuel the fire bring another victim
Take your lesson in Supremacy

Blood looks like paste on the wall
Bodies lay lifeless like dolls
A moment that felt like days
Lives extinct with inner rage

Noxious, I don't realize
Incessantly making up lies
In a moment of visceral hate
The last thing you see on my grave
Eyes
The last thing you'll see are my eyes

Beneath your facade
Panic, you scream for your god
No way out, ever abstain
Blood falls from the ceiling like rain
Patiently unleash my violence
In (?) with sounds of your silence
In darkness this feeling I love
To be covered in blood
Blood from above

This violence finally sets me free
Brings demons back to torture me
There's no god pulling at my strings
I'm above all sorrow that fate can bring
Disengaged, I see your face
I turn and rush, I can't replace
Hands around your neck, your senses numb
Staring into your eyes
When the stillness comes
Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yoursef
Not lie and make you believe
What's evil is making love
and making friends
and meeting God you're own way
The right way

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile

We stand alone

The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped -- they ran!
Now I'll play a public servant

To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me
I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile

Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven/hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life
I'd question things because I am human
And call NO ONE my father who's no closer that a stranger

I won't listen

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile
There is a part of me that's always sixteen 
I've found the secret of eternal youth 
Some get high on life or money 
But there's an escape 
Drop out the race 
To walk through world by one's self 
You can't be protected 
Your trust is in whisky, weed and Black Sabbath 
It's goddamn electric 
(chorus) Don't waste your time embrace it 
And then you will know yourself 
The change in you is goddamn electric 
The weight of the world is lifted and parted 
My eyes roll blind to sights that distract 
Through tunnel vision and dope haired blinders 
I'll cut a path and evoke my will 
To walk through the world by ones self 
You can't be protected 
Your trust is in whisky, weed and Slayer 
It's goddamn electric 
(chorus) Don't fake your life inhale it 
And then you'll know yourself 
The change in you is goddamn electric 
Don't waste my time, embrace it 
And then you'll know yourself 
The change that is goddamn electric will focus the minds eye 
One hand on the bottle 
The other a shaking fist 
Rejuvenated, yet isolated, no pressure 
From the outside, my sight is goddamn electric 
And these eyes have seen a world 
An entire goddamn electric system 
(chorus)
I fucked your girlfriend last night. 
While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love. 
She called me Daddy. And I called her baby when I 
Smacked her ass. I called her sugar when I ate 
Her alive till daylight. And I slept with her all 
Over me, from forehead to ribcage I'd ripper her ass. 
Sometimes I thought you might be spying, living out some 
Brash fantasy, but no. You were knocked out. But we were 
All knocked out you know. In a way 
I serve too many masters. 
We didn't know you'd break the bottle that the magic 
Came in to use those jagged shards to slit our wrists 
And neck. And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude. 
But you wouldn't know what you were doing because 
I didn't, your girlfriend could have been a burn 
Victim, an amputee, a dead body. But god damn I wanted 
To fuck. 
I'm serving too many fucking masters. 
[I told you. I told you motherfucker]
As a child I was given the gift to entertain you
But through blood I inherited a life that could destroy you
I drink all day. I smoke all day. I've done it all but tap 
The vein
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons 
All these Christians come alive and try to sell you 
My soul for a goat, yet I'll outlive the old
You know it's bad, some may say sad, a hangover is 
Inspiration. Like a junkie I hurt for it. A bad trip, the 
Emptiness. I never sleep, or always sleep a lack of 
Fulfillment to me is me. The big picture
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are part of 
What the Christians mean to immortalize my situation
My soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old
Embrace some religion. To get close to some 
Undivine ejaculation point
Simply to thy ghost I cling
Simply to thy ghost I reject
Simply to thy ghost I give spit
Tempter, tempting, tempt me. Molest me. You know that I'll 
Submit. For this is my weakness and it saves me from relationships 
With those Christians. You know they'll sell you my soul 
For a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old
You're in the danger zone 
You can't be left alone 
Your heart is 
In this for the ride 
But when it comes down to it 
You spoke your mind and you blew it 
I want you when I want 
And still I hear you say 
Hard ride with me 
Its a matter of time before 
You fall down on your knees 
Hard ride stay free 
Its a matter of time 
'Fore its too late 
The pressure's building up 
You feel you've had enough 
So go now
Away
I'll lay it on the table 
You're feelin' so unstable 
I want to love you 
But you seem so far away
Chorus 
And I don't even know your name 
I just want to throw you away
Eliminate, the life decline
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger
And it's not for sale by any stretch


It's like religion without a Bible
And the Dragon lives inside of my mouth
And speaks in tongues, the word

Hellbound in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound Fort Worth

Snakes, in Southern flames
To bring the thunder, the great decider
Would you believe in this or the ash?


I do believe it, it's taking over
Accept, accept, accept, accept

Hellbound in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound, Fort Worth

Born to a world so young and proud
And over your head hangs a black cloud
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself
Because there you cannot hide


Facing fears, you'll overcome
And one of these years you'll know you've won
You've won, you've won, you've won, you've won

Hellbound in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound, Fort Worth
Eliminate, the life decline
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger 
And it's not for sale by any stretch. 
It's like religion without a Bible 
And the Dragon lives inside my mouth 
And it speaks in tongues, the word  
 
Hellbound, in Ft. Worth, Texas 
Hellbound, Ft. Worth 
 
Snakes, in Southern flames 
To bring the thunder; the great decider 
Would you believe in this or the ash? 
I do believe it and it's taking over  
Accept 
 
Hellbound, in Ft. Worth, Texas 
Hellbound, Ft. Worth
Born to a world so young and proud 
But over your head hangs a black cloud 
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself 
Because there you cannot hide 
Facing fears that you'll overcome and one 
Of these years you know you've won 
 
Hellbound, in Ft. Worth, Texas 
Hellbound, Ft. Worth
Here we are in a world of corruption 
Human nature is a violent breed 
Who cares if there's no tomorrow 
When I die for my future's laid out for me 
Can't you see? 
Rise, above the lies 
Morals on a backwards globe 
A sin to you for me it's hope
It's my life and provision 
Black or white some pay to pray 
You question why they act this way 
It's their fucking decision 
No more judgment day 
Only tranquility 
Peace signs, protest lines 
Mean nothing to me 
Honesty
Born in me 
Heresy 
I know what's right or wrong 
And my belief is stronger Than your advice 
People, they go to war 
Because religion gives them reason to fight, sacrifice 
Sacrifice
A group that caters no one's fees 
Or synthetic deities 
Is where I belong 
My stand is the human race 
Without a label or a face 
So they can lick my sack 
No more judgment day 
Only tranquility 
Peace signs, protest lines 
Mean nothing to me 
Honesty
Born in me 
Heresy
Honesty
Born in me 
Heresy
I'm looking through a hole in the sky 
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie 
I'm getting closer to the end of the line 
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine 
I'm living in a room without any view 
I'm living free because the rent's never due 
The synonyms of all the things that I've said 
Are just the riddles that are built in my head 
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven 
Window in time, through it I fly 
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun 
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun 
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars 
I don't believe there's any future in cause 
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven 
Window in time, through it I fly 
Yeah 
I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast 
I've seen the western world go down in the east 
The food of love became the greed of our time 
But now I'm living on the profits of pride
What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last night,
About what we want to be
I sit now with his hand in mine,
But, I know he can't feel (feel)
No one knows, what's done is done
It's as if he were dead
I'm close with his mother,
And she cries endlessly
Lord, how we miss him,
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life,
But, it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions
No one knows, what's done is done
It's as if he were dead
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone)
He as hollow as I alone,
A shell of my friend,
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul,
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad
At gods
Mad
He as hollow as I converse,
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through,
I want to come in after you
My Best friend
My Best friend
Whoa, yeah 
Come back
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe
What's evil is making love
And making friends
And meeting God you're own way
The right way
To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile
We stand alone
The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped -- they ran!
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me
I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god
To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile
Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven/hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life
I'd question things because I am human
And call no one my father who's no closer that a stranger
I won't listen
I've written about my inner wars, 
But I could give a shit about right now, 
Most of me is all strength 
And all of me is at war with dope 
But my eyes are clear in sight 
My guts are blazing, 
I might have a life 
I can't hide, to erase, what I've done- 
Last year, and the years before 
It  still takes assholes of all kinds 
On that fact I am still clear, 
('Cause) I should know and now I do 
I'm one of them 
I'm just like you 
I'm just like you 
A man that stands his ground with strength 
Last year, and years before 
Can't hide myself 
I won't try 
It makes me strong 
It makes me strong 
It makes me strong 
It blows away weakness 
It blows away detachment 
It blows away the depression inside 
It blows away the mental withdrawal 
It blows that shit away
The end will crush the light 
And sends a message, It won't please 
The naked eye 
Without and end there is no light 
To foretell, to blind you 
The law of the claw reigns on and after still 
When I die, I cast a shadow 
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow 
I'm leaving more eyes open 
I close up both of mine 
For the ones that chase my life 
They're looking over shoulders 
Let paranoia in 
Spontaneously rule them 
When I die, I cast a shadow 
And I'll fly, I cast a shadow 
Everybody get fucking up! 
I cast a shadow... 
I... I cast a shadow 
I cast a shadow... 
I... I cast a shadow 
(Chorus) 
When I die, I cast a shadow 
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow
I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins
While loved ones mourn the day,
The absence of our faces,
Living, laughing, eyes awake
Is this too much for them to take?
Too young for one's conclusion, the lifestyle won
Such values you taught your son
That's how
Look at me now
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken
One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life
Force fed to make us heed
Inbred to sponge our bleed
Every warning, a leaking rubber,
A poison apple for mingled blood
Too young for one's delusion, the lifestyle cost
Venereal Mother embrace the loss
That's how
Look at you now
You're broken
Inherit your life
You're broken
That's how
Look at us now
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken
That's how
Look at me now
I'm broken (broken)
I'm broken (broken)
I'm broken (broken)
I'm broke
Deathlike silence
Red clouds shake
The race that walls imortality
The undying battle of extinction
Who would believe in sanctuary
HUH, in sanctuary
Weapons of lead are post historic
Life is yeilded up to sour ground
A desert shell is designated
A warning to you both man and beast
Destroying, destoying
Foundation, foundation
I'm going, i'm going
Forever
Imortally insane
Imortally insane
Imortally insane
Imortally insane
Eden hardly a tranquill place 
The prophecy lears its hateful face
The warheads like lightning strike again and again
separating the land from the wolf and man
HUH, No sanctuary
Suvivors will rise from strength and brain
The skulls of rivals lay in rows on the sand
The seeds of breeding swallow the waste
Creating more for the next war
Destroying, destoying
Foundation, foundation
I'm going, i'm going
Forever
Imortally insane
Imortally insane
Imortally insane
Imortally insane
(SOLO)

Imortally insane
Imortally insane
Imortally insane
Imortally insane

Imortally insane
Imortally insane
Insane
Gone... (x2) 
The time had finally come to kill the vein. 
And I'm dropping down the dirt on your grave 
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad 
Rid of a fool like you 
The wrath has just begun 
The time has finally come 
And it hurts so bad, and it drives me mad 
Life with a blinded view (of you) 
(Chorus) 
It makes them disappear 
It fills their life with fear 
When their future isn't clear 
It makes them disappear 
- Gone - (x2) 
So the coward has up and run to be saved 
But with each step taken down, you sink in your grave 
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad 
Rid of a fool like you 
(Chorus) 
Get the fuck on down the road 
(Solo) 
(Chorus)
Full of grief I scream at the wind 
Thought I heard the words of others 
Imprison myself 
And stay in a shell 
I won't let you in to have a story to tell 
Things tend to drag me down 
Don't understand so they hate me now 
 
My fear grips the will of stone 
My grip fears I'll die alone 
I promised myself somewhere in the teenage life 
I'd never submit to the ones I will not be like 
Live in a hole 
But stay close to my kind 
Cause they understand what burns in my mind 
I still feel incomplete 
Friends are few and far between 
My fear grips the will of stone 
My grip fears I'll die alone
I cannot take the take, your condition was nod awake 
A selfish cryer, boldface liar, robbing all of what 
You could take in 
Stabbed towards a death, a dirty smelling girl 
Shit decisions, no provisions, filling veins with juice 
Of chaos 
(Chorus) 
Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole, empty bag, sunken eyes, whining dog, it's times like this 
You should pray for never 
I broke your fucking mold, then threw away the 
Cast, new religion and new provisions, it's amazing 
You're alive 
Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into 
Erase the end dissolving, disgrace is needed more 
So I mended severed ties, through flesh we cauterized 
The undeserving, sliming, writhing, I filled you up 
With watered promise 
(Chorus)(2nd half) 
Spitting teeth, oral lust, alley fuck, angel dust, anal whore, bleeding 
Knees, it's times 
Like this to pray for murder 
(Chorus #2) 
So now I've seen it all, Hells' wrath , no 
Man has greater glory, cause now you're living through me 
So I'm done with saving you, a gift unto myself, a 
Tired savior, a wasted favor, and I'm lucky I'm alive
Many distant miles away 
Past the shores of ever dark 
There stays a magic man 
Who bears an evil mark 
He helps all concerned 
Those who come again return 
Injecting lies while fires burn 
The devil's heart 
With angel's words 
Have you wondered 
What heaven's like? 
She can show you in one night 
Overwhelming with euphoric lift 
To lure you to steal your gift 
Intoxication 
Seeping down to the bone 
And there's no question 
To where you have to go 
Understand, just take his hand 
He's the medicine man 
Understand, just take his hand 
He's the medicine man 
Once proud and fearless men 
With desire in their eyes 
Lost strong and fruitful lives 
To self-indulgent ties 
Their souls were dipped in venom 
Then put into a box 
Then placed upon a crowded shelf 
Where countless souls now rot 
Have you ever wondered what hell's like? 
He can take you there 
Just one taste and you'll be back 
And by the high you'll swear 
Intoxication 
Seeping down to the bone 
And there's no question 
To where you have to go 
Understand just take his hand 
He's the medicine man
Understand just take his hand 
He's the medicine man
Understand just take his hand 
He's the medicine man
Understand just take his hand 
He's the medicine man
There's a place that I keep deep inside me 
It can trigger my mind 
All along I knew it has been with me 
Since I was just a child 
I just summon power within my soul 
It has given me life, beyond life 
I take blame for my murderous problem 
My signature always reminds 
It's a message in blood 
It's your cryptic warning 
Within the message in blood  
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life 
I'm provoked into sick confrontations, 
Brutal time after time,
Bed of nails, suffocation, life's ending, 
Slay in different designs 
One man's misery is another man's mystery 
No one cares to understand my 
Demented means 
Sticks and stones can break all your brittle bones, 
Epitaph written at your feet 
It's a message in blood 
It's your cryptic warning 
Within the message in blood 
Marks the years of pain, 
And your godforsaken ending to life
It's a message in blood 
It's your cryptic warning 
Within the message in blood 
Marks the years of pain, 
And your godforsaken ending to life
Message in blood 
Message in blood 
Message in blood 
Message in blood
Revenge, I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong, I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined
Possessed, I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength, the strength of many to crush who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined
There comes a time within everyone
To close your eyes to what's real
No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest
Let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
No one can piss on this determination
Now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Got shit on
Pissed on
Spit on
Stepped on
Fucked with
Pointed at by lesser men

New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

A new level of confidence and power

Demanding plea for unity between us all
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar
Power
Impatient
Because time is shorter

New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

A new level of confidence and power

No fucking surrender
Can't lose
Life kills
In the states 
There's a problem with race 
Because of ignorant past burned fires 
From evolution 
We've been killing each other 
I figure man should have it down to a science 
No chance 
Not for a minute 
Not for a second 
I won't be defensive 
I'm straight out in my opinion 
You'd better listen to a man who knows what he is saying 
I've seen your side 
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior 
Be superior 
And know your interior 
Race, pride, prejudice 
Black man, white man 
No stand 
Live in the past 
We make it last 
A hated mass 
No solution 
Mind pollution 
For revolution 
So low behold my eyes 
This land of fools will rise 
No good 
For no one 
You blame oppression and play the role of criminals 
To rape and burn show progress is minimal 
White hoods and militants you know it's such a pity 
Living, breathing 
Violence in your city 
If one man 
Had one home 
In one world 
Held live alone without variety 
Full of anxiety 
No one to point at, question 
Or even talk to -- in his private grave 
No matter what color 
He wouldn't be saved from hell 
He dwells 
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells 
Race, pride, prejudice 
Black man, white man 
No stand 
Live in the past 
We make it last 
A hated mass 
No solution 
Mind pollution 
For revolution 
So low behold my eyes 
This land of fools will rise 
No good 
For no one
Slaving for eternity 
Aiming for construction 
Reckless crew abandon me 
Bringing on destruction 
Primal needs
Annoying ways 
Incapacitation
A legacy of submankind 
Who seem to rule this nation 
Out of touch with your life 
Can' t you see the signs 
For me to know 
Can you find out 
Read betwen the lines 
No way out 
When the cat goes away 
Over and out 
The mice come out and play 
Unrelentless trilogy 
Asking to accept them 
Tempers flare 
Screams are heard 
To uphold the profession 
Time and time and times again 
I will not play your game 
I ask you once a billion times 
To keep your life the same 
No way out 
When the cat goes away 
Over and out 
The mice come out and play 
No way out 
The price that you must pay 
Over and out 
Every dog has its day
Half assed for most his life
Done nothing but stand
Just because he's so small so
No one will give him a hand
The kinda guy that would steal your cast
And buy a burning house
Then call you up and invite you in
And jerk you off with a sandpaper hand
I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind
Piss in the wind,
A go-getter who ain't got none
A legend in his mind
Always the one to invite himself
And then just left behind
Someone must've clipped his balls
Or wiped his ass of his life
A self centered procrastinator
Attention seeker who's got nothing at all
I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind
We sail through endless skies 
Stars shine like eyes 
The black night sighs 
The moon in silver trees 
Falls down in tears 
Light of the night 
The earth, a purple blaze 
Of sapphire haze 
In orbit always 
While down below the trees 
Bathed in cool breeze 
Silver starlight breaks down the night 
And so we pass on by the crimson eye 
Of great god Mars 
As we travel the universe
There's a double standard for the way we live 
If there's nothing to have, well then there's nothing to save 
I'll break a sweat and I don't regret 
What you'd kill to see brings out the god in me. 
Come and be with me 
Live my twisted dream 
Pro devoted pledge 
Time for primal concrete sledge 
The man of a thousand retirements 
Will always be the one to tell you when to quit 
I won't take stock in a withered man 
I'm reaching into you, I'll make you understand 
Come and be with me 
Live my twisted dream 
Pro devoted pledge 
Time for primal concrete sledge
Come and be with me 
Live my twisted dream 
Pro devoted pledge 
Time for primal concrete sledge
Come and be with me 
Live my twisted dream 
Pro devoted pledge 
Time for primal concrete sledge
Empty and sweating 
Head lying in your hands 
Shaking in the corner 
Done too much alcohol 
Gotta get away from it all 
'Cause it feels my blood is freezing 
My self insanity has taken its toll 
Frustration has taken its control 
Now I'm far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set my demons free 
Been put to the test 
My mind laid to rest 
I'm on a psycho holiday 
Shot down on sight 
You are the target of attention 
One woman here, another there 
You can't please all the people all the time 
Can't tell the strangers 
From the friends you know 
Frustration has taken it's control 
Now you're far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set your demons free 
Been put through the test 
Your mind laid to rest 
You're on a psycho holiday 
I'm strapped in for life 
Is this where I live 
Or where I die
You want my money 
You take my space 
My mind is telling me 
To leave this place 
My self insanity has taken its toll 
Frustration has taken its control 
Now I'm far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set my demons free 
Been put through the test 
My mind laid to rest 
I'm on a psycho holiday
Now I'm far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set my demons free 
Been put through the test 
My mind laid to rest 
I'm on a psycho holiday
Now I'm far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set my demons free 
Been put through the test 
My mind will never rest 
Strapped in a psycho holiday
I've trampled on that road
That you think you own
You have that 'smart ass' attitude
It's time to stop the fiction
I live it every day
While you're mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing
Hard time is coming
My time, your pain
I reign on you
You think you own
I take away
Take it with me
You think you own
I took away
Made it my own
Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
The so many times
You practice in your mirror
To be just like me
But you just can't see
You ain't got the balls, son
I fight for love of brother
Your friends fight one another
You can't see because your head's up your ass
And just in cast you think you're bad
I crush your rush
I rule you fool
I'm immovable stone in your world of weak I speak
68' I was into the world, born
And the seventies were a breath after the war (Vietnam)
Life was confusing because of my age
Should my eyes open for tomorrows gains
I can't help the way I am
There's no trust and there's no end
What is my name

It's time for a change
It can't stay the same
Forever is my name

From now on I can't look the other way
But keep in mind, and listen to what I say
Take underwing all the ones who are lost
And build up around them an infinite wall
Don't you know just who I am
Take the hand of the wisdoms friend
What is my name

It's time for a change
It can't stay the same
Forever is my name

It will never change
So here it stays
Revolution is my name
It's time to change, It can't stay the same
Forever is my name
What is my name, Forever
What is my name, Revolution

It's time for a change
It can't stay the same
Forever is my name
We've got no time to lose 
Your news is old news 
Hate this, hate me, hate this 
Right approach for the wrong 
It's time to spread the word 
Let the voice be heard 
All of us, one of us, all of us 
Dominate and take the motherfucking world 
Mass prediction, unification 
Breathing life into out lungs 
Every creed and every kind 
To give us depth for strength 
Taught when we're young to hate one another 
It's time to have a new reign of power 
Make pride universal so no one gives in 
Turn our backs on those who oppose 
Then when confronted we ask them the question 
That's wrong with their mind? 
What's wrong with your mind? 
[Chorus] 
It's time to rise 
We've lived with past mistakes 
And we've lived with our own 
Forgive, forget forgive 
Be a man, not a child 
There are to tears for peace 
Of the common sympathies 
Educate, reinstate, educate 
A thing of past 
The trouble in the states 
It's time to rise
Scrape it, grind it, peel it, hide it
The trend is over and gone forever
Shelf it, box it, save it, frame it
You won't need that anymore,
It's on sale at the dollar store
Waste of time, pantomime, circus doll, at the local mall
Exterminate, it's all fake!
Exterminate, it's all fake
Sandblast yourself
Sandblast yourself
Sandblast
Sandblast
It's getting old, old, old
It's storming broken glass, corpses left in piles 
Ungracious bludgeonment that breaks the earth for miles 
Nothing can stop it, the day has come, from below it's catastrophic 
Freezing, there's no healing 
Families are dying 
This world is shattered 
All shattered 
Life crushing turbulence, 
This wrath can't be denied 
Wishing you could help your friends, 
Standing where they died 
Echoes haunting, a hollow planet, lacerations, 
Dissected nation 
Freezing, there's no healing 
Everyone is dying 
This world is shattered
All shattered
Freezing, there's no healing 
Everyone is dying 
This world is shattered
All shattered
All shattered
All shattered
I don't want you to look at me while I'm shedding
Skin. I can't afford for you to see what's inside me.
I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me. I
Feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me.
I was betrayed, one more day of my short life. You were
Carried away. You had no shame. To suffocate my being.
I was me, but you weren't you. You were sticking to me like
a scab...so I peeled you away, and bled for days. Then
Stepped out of myself.
  
I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.
I don't think you belong in here, I feel I'm sick. Don't ask because
You know damn well where I've been. I've kept a simple
Woman through the thick and thin. But I've found the guts
to sever from my Siamese twin.
I throw you away. Everyday. A dead part of life. Strangling
back. Seething black. In between my longing for torture.
Blood on my face that came from your face. The mix
Of kissing and bleeding. I put you away. I shut you away.
I pissed you away. I threw you away.
  
I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.
You're fucking, and sucking. You're friendless. It's endless.
Your flower has soured. It's endless. You're friendless.
It's harder. And stronger. But no one's been inside you longer.
Or harder. Or deeper. To get you off, you need the fear.
It's never love. Bloody touch. Broken wrist. Needle rust.
Choking throat. Swallowed teeth. Head fuck. No peace.
I'm shedding my skin to peel you off of me.
You've got to love me.
Ornament. Shrunken head. Playtoy. Snake strike. Poisonous.
Syphillis. Drenched me. Soaked me.
I'm shedding my skin to drain you out of me.
You've got to hate me.
One's own Kingman, Christ person, Woman God.
At battle with a mass astringent. The bond
That blends the weak to the wise.
It's a safe assumption that you'd want
to save me now. But I'll never face castration.
For your sacred sow is left slaughtered.
Brainwashed by me. Myself influence I. Bird brained
World saver. A fake god rests dead inside you.
It's a safe assumption that you'd want to save me now.
But I'll never face castration. For your sacred sow is left

Slaughtered.

System destroyed. Exposed and unemployed. The fruit
Of intention cry for their dead, but turning their head to
Ignore reality's claw. Knife to your wrist, syringe in your
Arm is your ounce of prevention. Give what you made,
And under your name on your grave, is salvation. A big
Fucking joke.

Slaughter the pig, the self-righteous king for your own
Restoration. For your God is in your chest, and faith kills
What is precious, for death is unanswered.

Do sin.
There is nothing. No education. No family life to open my 
Arms to. You'd say that my job is today, yet gone tomorrow. 
I'll be broke in a gutter. 
I know the opinion. A broken record. Fuck you and your 
College dream. Fact is, we're stronger than all. 
You're working for perfect bodies, perfect minds and perfect 
Neighbors. But I'm helping to legalize dope on 
Your pristine streets and I'm making a fortune. 
You're muscle and gall. Naive at best. I'm bone, brain and 
Cock. Deep down stronger than all. 
A sad state of affairs. A crippled America. A pipe dream 
Buttfucked. Immune. Stronger than all. 
A lament for a rookie officer, punk ass weak little lamb. 
For the mob, truly, does rule at this particular time. 
We've grown into a monster. An arrogant, explosive motherfuck. 
Hard as a rock. Shut like a lock. 
Finally, the president in submission. He holds out his hand on 
Your television and draws back a stump. It's too late for some. 
Far too late. 
No more holdbacks. No more paying a cops paycheck. Let him 
Bust his own child. The son that heeds my word and smokes my dope. 
The daughter that sucks me off and snorts cheap anything. 
Hail Kings. The new Kings. Stronger than all. 
A simple process to legalize. There would not be a choice but to 
Take our side. Be there no question of certain strengths. Know 
This intention. Forever stronger than all.
Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take the pain away
Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot see inside yours and mine
When I'm hiding, when I need it, it lets me breathe 
For our handle on this life, I don't believe this time 
Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again
Forever fooling, free and using, sliding down the slide that breaks a will
Mothers angel, getting smarter, how smart are you to regress unfulfilled? 
It's a damn shame,
When I'm hiding, when I need it, it lets me breathe 
For our handle on this life, I don't believe this time 
Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again
Unity is a rare thing
Blind eyes of society bring
The category of minority
Now what are we supposed to be?
Born free to be
Powerless to change the world
With our lives in the hands of madmen

Now in times when society needs us
This is where the sin begins
We're aware they're going to free us
Rage from our hearts within
Born of this world
Which is a living hell
But we'll be closer to heaven

So now, this is the art
To shred, its only emotion
This is the art
To shred, its only emotion

Shred!

So now, this is the art
To shred, its only emotion
This is the art
To shred, its only emotion
This is the art
To shred, its only emotion

If ever words were spoken
Painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life

Was the keeping

Love was twisted and pointed at you

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, thing, child, toy
You keep this love, fist, scar, break
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

You keep this love, thing, child, toy
You keep this love, fist, scar, break
You keep this love

No more head trips
This is feeding what I am. 
It's like salt poured into a deep, infected wound. It's the 
type of pain you really dig and long for. I've always been 
Insecure to open up and show love. Some pretty girl with 
Long hair, some bald guy writhing. 
rejection
The kind that's self induced. The tongue that's 
Bitten through. The nauseating stab. Is feeding what 
I am. A short fuse. 
If there really is a god, then it's punishing me constantly. 
She let me taste that sugarhole and of course, I wanted 
More. 
But no. I'm reduced to a Rottypanol snort and a lot of drinks. 
This shit goes on and on. Just look down my pants. 
Rejection
It ain't a fucking game. My human dick to 
blame. A sociopathic plan. Is feeding what I am. 
Rejection
Takes life away from eyes. Will give you to 
The skies. It makes me more than a man. Is drowning 
What I am.

Enlight your sense of thought, of touch, of real, a shield, 
An underground for this coward. 
Building a blood in water scent. It's like some raping, 
without judgement. 
Boy in a pocket. Balls in a bag. Serve and 
Protect you. His dick his gun, his brain his badge.

Absorb through pores the great escape. Kill that fuck

Ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for.

Arm yourself. A branch. A third arm. Extend your health, 
Crawl inside euphoria. Building a blood in water scent. It's 
Like a scraping. It's entrapment. Boy in a pocket. Balls in

A faster way to exterminate them takes too fucking 
long. Absorb through pores the great escape. 
Kill that fuck to show him up. Equal his displeasure now. 
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for. 
Ourselves. 
Half assed for most his life. Piss poor little ham. NARO

And the world. We need a fucking cold war.
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence
One step from lashing out at you

What do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been
Belong

Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk

Run your mouth when I'm not around

Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word

Truly, fuck the world, for all it's worth, every inch of Planet 
Earth, fuck myself, don't leave me out, but don't get 
involved, don't corner me 
Inside, ulcer, unjust bastards, file out face first 
Meet the lies and see what you are 
It's forcing you down, and it's grinding against you 
Let the war nerve break 
 
For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and 
judges what I am in one paragraph - Look here - Fuck you all 
Expect the worse, you bleeding heart, but kill me first 
before it starts, yes my cock is getting hard, we are 
born different after all 
Invite mayhem, produce weapons, shoot out, burn down

Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost 
Apologies unacceptable now

Hate 
Hate mail is not read, in jail instead 
Hate 
The Lord knows, there's worse 
Ignore, this curse 
Hate
Wear 10 crowns, dragons heads 
Southern are the sons, the lords unmatched 
Their eyes down don't look right, should they be trusted now 
Trash mouthed Gods, avoiding kings 
With the spirit of revolt, the ghost of the youth 
Every fucking year it stays the same 
Everybody changes to suit the day 
Out of pride I'll isolate my fears 
Never turned our backs on why we're here 
We'll grind that axe for a long time 
Follow close the train of fools 
Just like them (could be) just like you 
Their eyes don't seem right 
Easily impressed plague, for dressed up fakes 
(I have) no respect 
Every fucking year remains the same 
Everybody sucks up to suit the day 
Out of hate I'll isolate myself 
Through the worst we still march into hell 
[Repeat: x2]
We'll grind that axe for a long time
The smell in the air is chicken shit 
Every fucking song remains the same 
To everyone who sucks up for the fame 
Out of strength you know we speak the truth 
Every trend that dies is living proof 
We'll grind that axe for a long time
When the world pronounced me dead
put me in the grave
the cut off my legs
it was not long
I couldn't hold my mouth
I ran my head
I ran my head
It's strange to be around again
things might have killed me 
but not the bastard in the skies
I was fucking with the plan
asking for it all, 
call it karma or guilt
being dragged down the road
call it wisdom or ignorance
But it's still alive 
and it's in me now
and it lives and breathes
but, I can't give a fuck
I've got a big mouth
and there's a lot to learn
from a bottle of whiskey
it's where you come from

A remedy to the curse
cold turkey, drop the bomb
on harder wares control
suspend above, become one

It may piss you off
It might be shit
But I just can't lie around
Feeling sorry for myself
I could care less 
(from weed and whiskey) 
I fell in front of my friends
I dropped out in front of the world
you call that supernatural?
I ain't
Black wings will weather your flight
for some there's no second time
following paths of your life
I stepped off the mountain to the sky
watch your ass no
it's where you come from
it's where you come from
There's nothing special about it 
It's either there when your born or not 
Gifted with talent are no big deal 
Welcome to the death of a century 
'Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow is the day you will have to face 
There's no rewinding time 
Because yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Reliving old reviews is a useless tool of confusion 
Don't hold your breath for the turn around 
Come into the world of endless odds 
'Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow is the day you will have to face 
There's no rewinding time 
Because yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
They will tell you all about guilt 
And in time you'll face the darkness 
But darkness is a friend to you 
Embrace and fly through the madness 
Flying past God and wars and conflict 
The oppressor is in you 
The oppressor is in you 
Plowing through minds and paranoia 
The oppressor is in you
The oppressor is in you 
'Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow is the day you will have to face 
There's no rewinding time 
Because yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
You protect you and I'll keep you to myself 
It can only be that way
Build an inner door, drop and then explore 
You smoke your head on straight, then drink 
Your woes away 
Some might not understand possession that's beyond your head 
You recognize it, while some ignore it 
Avoid the masses, you got to belong to it 
So the music is your friend 
Well it's the roof above my head 
So seriously I take the will that never breaks 
Some might not understand, the possession that controls your hands 
You recognize it, while some ignore it 
Avoid the masses, you got to belong to it 
You recognize it, while some ignore it 
Avoid the masses, you got to belong to it 
It's power and sin 
And then you've got whisky and smoke 
And it's all a man could need, to plant the perfect seed 
To disembody me 
Making more like you and me 
You recognize it, while some ignore it 
Avoid the masses, you got to belong to it
My skin is cold, transfusion with somebody morose and 
old, drop into fruitless dying 
It was tempting and bared, the whoring angel rising 
Now burning prayers, my silent time of losing 
My foes, they can't destroy my body 
Colliding slow, like life itself 
Long for the blur, we cannot dry much longer 
Cement to dirt, disgusted with my cheapness 
My foes, they can't destroy my body 
Colliding slow, like life itself 
My foes, they can't destroy my body 
Colliding slow, like life itself 
Reaching down, staring up (at the forgiver)
Whores 
Your windows boarded up, your private lives exposed 
The talk shows pump it up, lab rats diseased for show 
We're doomed to use the slang, outbreak of drug roulette 
A church burned to the ground, not even noticed yet 
13 Steps (To Nowhere) 
Whores 
A backwards swastika, the black skin riddled in lead 
A Nazi Gangster Jew, it beats a dog that's dead 
It's in to use the slang, outbreak of gun roulette 
The cross slants to the side, will prove the damnedest yet 
13 Steps - Leads to nowhere 
The backlash dislocates, an untimely reign of death 
The wolf poked with the stick, awaits with cancerous breath 
(Leads to nowhere) 
Outsiders still suppose, there's Holy streets to roam 
The truth should not surprise, your homes were built on lies
I vent my frustration at you old man
After years your ears will hear
You screamed you tried 
It's words of a weakling
And promises made by a liar
(drunken liar)
Now you pick up that splintered chair
That was aiming for your head
A head that should have been long ago
Kicked in by me...Alone
(I won't lose a second of sleep for this)
Don't touch me 
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
No
Ever again
Don't touch me 
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Orphaned to the dope and drinks
I learned my lesson well somehow from you
No tears. Can't clutch my regrets
But these years of detachment
Have left me with demons now surfacing
(I'm becoming more than you'll be)
You never knew the answers to
Any of my questions, did you?
You made up all the answers to
My unimportant existence
(You don't have to dump me off, not again)
Don't touch me 
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck no, never again
Don't touch me 
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck no, never again
Don't touch me 
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
I vow, lest I die tomorrow
You'll never be the father I am
The bastard father to the thousands
Of the ugly, criticized, unwanted.
The ones with fathers just like you
We're fucking you back
Fucking you back
I'm shoving my life right down your throat.
Can I
Find the guts? Can I feel the heart?
Look at the ground as you choke me up,
Does it taste like tequila?
Or failure?
We're fucking you back
I see you had your mind all made up you group of pitiful liars.
Before I woke to face the day, your master plan transpired.
Something told me, this job had more to meet the eye.
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole.

You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom

Can't be what your idols are.
Can't leave the scar.
You cry for compensation.
I ask you please just give us

5 minutes alone

I read your eyes, your mind was made up.
You took me for
A fool.
You used complexion of my skin for a counter
Rascist tool.
You can't burn me, I've spilled my guts out
In the past.
Taken advantage of because you know where

I've come (from) my past.
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom

Can't be what your idols are.
Can't leave the scar.
You cry for compensation.
I ask you please just give us

5 minutes alone
Modern day plague 
Stronger than any and every virus, disease or sickness 
Full eclipse of ideality 
Anti-christian, and nocturnally alive (undead) 
Buried underneath two thousand years (of histories) 
Yet able to rise 
Instinctively arise

My fledglings dropping, weeping

True and purely hollow 
Man's ultimate enemy and predator 
Wrapped into one

A long time ago I never knew myself. Then the memory
Of shame birthed its gift.
No more. The small one, the weak one, the frightened one.
Running from beatings, deflating. I'm becoming more
Than a man. More than you ever were. Driven and burning
To rise beyond Jesus.

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

I found my life was slipping through my hands. Perhaps
Through death my life won't be so bad.
I can see you, can fuck you, inside of you. Staring through
Your eyes. Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me,
To realize my saving grasp. I of suicide. I the unlord.

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize
Babe 
I need you again 
It's getting late 
I'm getting high 
Please let me in 
Love 
I give you all my love 
I just need someone to hold on to 
Won't you let me in 
Girl 
You're the biggest part of me 
I need you back in my arms 
Girl 
You're the biggest part of me 
How long will you leave me out here 
In the dark? 
Another lonely night 
Back in silent town 
Thinkin' of ways to get you back 
In my arms 
Lovin' me all the love you can give 
But you've got to go 
I just can't live 
Another day 
There's no other way

You're the biggest part of me 
I need you back in my arms

How long will you leave me out here 
In the dark? 
It's a lonely night 
Feels like I'm dying inside 
All I need is one more chance before I 
Lose my mind

Serving the faith 
Abduction the oath 
It lie in wait for the offering 
Religion is old 
For drawing the young 
Purity withers and dies 
Never return to the ones that provided 
Children draining parents of will 
I hold out my hand to bloodless child 
I'm taken by the one I was saving 
From death 
By demons be driven 
Beckon the call 
With decline in mind 
End not far 
We're left hanging alone here 
He pulls us from nails 
Shatters our bones 
Leaving us crippled and strewn 
Boiling my corpse in the blood of his children 
Praying for his god to prevail 
Burying us with loved ones 
To sleep with shelled children of the sixth dimension 
By demons be driven 
Beckon the call
Reverend, reverend,
Is this a conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
No revenge beneath me
Lost within my plans for life,
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world,
Left in my misery
Reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see,
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see now is your 
Well I guess you took my youth
And gave it all away
Like the birth of a new found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories now unfold
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates
Sometimes when I'm alone,
I wonder aloud,
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free,
Belong to me at last
Through all those complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete,
All alone as the memories still remain
The way we were,
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word,
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates
The way we were,
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain.
Believe the word,
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery
Gates
Gates
Gates
Sometimes I know 
I feel untouchable 
Drowning in life 
Caught up in the accessible 
Back down the ground 
I hear the sound 
There's no escape 
The concrete cloud 
Spilling on me 
Drenching me with 
Layman's sins 
I hear the sirens 
From the back of me 
I'm crashing face first 
Into the glass eye 
Clash with reality 
It rears it's ugly head 
Clash with reality 
The indescribable 
Let the dogs lie 
Where we sleep 
Irrelevant theme 
A situation and there's 
Nothing but right 
In kicks the door 
Nobody moves 
'Cause in walks the problem 
Dictates your fate 
Evicts, convicts 
Who'll sign the write of life? 
This now becomes 
Their morbid game 
Who's piss poor excuse 
Is this for a world? 
It swells my hatred 
Day by day

Under the lights where we stand tall 
Nobody touches us at all 
Showdown, shootout, spread fear within, without 
We're gonna take what's ours to have 
Spread the word throughout the land 
They say the bad guys wear black 
We're tagged and can't turn back
You see us comin' 
And you all together run for cover 
We're takin over this town
Here we come reach for your gun 
And you better listen my friend, you see

Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell 
Deed is done again, we've won 
Ain't talking no tall tales friend 
'Cause high noon, your doom 
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell
Pillage the village, trash the scene 
But better not take it out on me 
'Cause a ghost town is found 
Where your city used to be 
So out of the darkness and into the light 
Sparks fly everywhere in sight 
From my double barrel, twelve gauge
Can't lock me in your cage
You see us comin' 
And you all together run for cover

Numbing rumble, countless medicine, 
Depleted from years of abuse 
Death rattle shaking 
And there's no faking, undertaking 
Pressure point, rigor mortis 
Induce, grasp of poison hands 
Death rattle shaking 
From years of compulsive mistaking 
Death rattle shakes 
Death rattle shakes 
Disease of eyes, the addict blindfold, reduced to 
The realms of death 
Death rattle shaking 
Accumulating life it's taking

I've seen the end, and there is no light. 
Like deadly snakes, death rattle shakes

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again
So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate, if I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
My smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint
My own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
My love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know
Agony is the price
That you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you
Then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel
And manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget
When there's nothing else
Left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall
It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination

A now blacked heart
Is reaching out in divinity
Body's suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of you life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination
A smack on the wrists is the words from the mouth 
of the outsiders, lawyers, police 
A small price to pay for the dope and the guns 
And the rape, it should all be O.K. 
Your father is rich, he's the judge, he's the man, 
he's the God that got your sentence reduced 
But in the back of his mind, he well knows what

Drag the waters some more 
Like never before 
Sweet is the slice and the lips, you're gonna have 
that woman - she is your favorite lay 
Promised you (swore) that no one had been there,

Let it move in, you got thin, and got high, and 
your money went and so did your friends 
But she's by your side, and her smile cannot hide 
the premonition of the beckoning end, the end
Drag the waters some more 
Like never before 
Drag the waters some more 
Like never before 
In with it, out with it
I see you had your mind all made up you group of
Pitiful liars, before I woke to face the day, your master
Plan transpired, something told me this job had more to
Meet the eye, my song is not believed? my words some
What deceiving? now I'm unwhole
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are, can't leave the scar
You cry for compensation, I ask you please just give us
5 minutes alone
I read your eyes, your mind was made up, you took me for
A fool, you used complexion of my skin for a counter
Racist tool, you can't burn me I've spilled my guts out
In the past taken advantage of because you know where
I've come from my past
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are, can't leave the scar

How many more will cross my path
How many more must die

I never wonder why

You wake up every morning thinking everything's okay

Sinners falling at his knees

They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and you're classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

You choose your enemies

Everything that I say and do

Tell me where do I belong
In a sick society

You're no different to me
You're no different
No different to me

Grandeur of lies

If you think you're without sin
The first to cast the stone

Living my life in a way
That I choose
You say I should apologize

Reflecting jealousy

Tell me the truth and I'll admit
To my guilt
If you'll try to understand
But is that blood that's on your hand
From your democracy
I don't need no doctor
But I need something to kill the pain

Searching for a different ride

Why can't they just let me be
Alone without the misery
Hey, hey, do the zombie, zombie stomp
Flirting with disaster
Morning after killing me again
Hiding from the laughter
And the demons dancing round my brain
Always dancing on thin ice
I guess I'll have to pay the price
Hey, hey, do the zombie stomp
Thinking how it could have been
If I had never let them in
Hey, hey, do the zombie, zombie stomp
Take me to the doctor
'cause I feel it coming on again
Don't know where I'm going
'cause I guess I don't know where I've been

Always dancing on thin ice

Hey, hey, do the zombie, zombie stomp
Your words they go like no mare
They sale the world high headed, yeah
I can't believe I'm still here
I know I should be dead, yeah

This desperation makes me feel so filthy
But I know if I don't stop I won't feel guilty
Take me higher
Pray me faster
Help me get her
Who I'm after

One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One time to keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away

There is no future waiting
There is no morning ever
I can't stop the place is spinning

My anti drugs get trashed, yeah
This paranoia stops my mind from sinking
I don't know if I'm awake or if I'm dreaming

Take me in you, won't be nice
Spit me out or wait and shine me

One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One time to keep me high all day

A child of a broken mind
The fear that I hide behind
I hate rejection it's the worst
It gravely hurts me
Living inside my head
I feel like the living dead
I need your affection
It's the best
It greatly helps me
With my back against the wall
Trying so hard not to fall
I'm so tired of sleeping around
Hopeless, in despair
Don't know if I'm here or there
Feeling like I'm up and I'm down
But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere I don't want to die
A head full of tragic schemes
What keeps me alive is dreams
I dream that someday I'll find the key that sets my mind free
You may think I've lost control
The man with the broken soul
I'm not here to try and make excuses
Just believe me
With my back against the wall
Trying so hard not to fall
I'm so tired of sleeping around
Hopeless, in despair
Don't know if I'm here or there
Feeling like I'm up and I'm down
But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere, you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere I don't want to die, yeah
But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere, you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere, you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here I don't want to die, yeah

I have fallen from grace, and my ashes are scattered
No longer a passion and flesh
My flame is alive, though my wings have been shattered
They laid my body to rest.
My spirit is breathing, my senses are pure
Like reincarnation my soul will endure
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Back on earth
Back on earth
Back on earth
The spirit it never lets go
Like fountains of sorrow, the faces are crying
I'm witnessing all of their pain
Death is so final for only the living
The spirit will always remain
Bury me deep just to cover my sins
My soul is redeemed as the journey begins
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Back on earth

Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon
Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon
Hey, bark at the moon
They cursed and buried him Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning Hell-unholy one
But now he's returned to prove them wrong
So wrong, uh yeah baby
Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell
And when he finds who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon
Yeah bark at the moon
Yeah bark at the moon
Bark at the moon
Watching the time go and feeling belief grow
Rise above the obstacles
People beseech me but they'll never teach me
Things that I already know (I know)
Dreams that have shattered may not have mattered
Take another point of view
Doubts will arise though like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two (that's true)
You've got to believe in yourself 
or no one Will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying, free for you to use (okay baby)
I can't believe they stop and stare
And point their fingers doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind it's just that they won't see
I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise
You load the dice and paint the smile upon your face
With fingers crossed you switch the perfume with the mace
What kind of dreams to you enjoy inside your bed
I'll face the lies and shake the evil from your head
Black Illusion
Is all I ever see
Black Illusion
I bring you misery
Oh yeah
Yeah
You always seem to know the answer to it all
You seem to cheat the truth and never take the fall
Your life is hollow and you simply the rules
The time will come when you will join the other fools
Black Illusion
Is all I ever see
Black Illusion
I bring you misery
Oh yeah
Yeah
I load the dice and fake a smile upon my face
With fingers crossed I switch the perfume with the mace
What kind of dreams do I enjoy inside my bed
You'll face the lies and shake the evil from my head

Your comin' home - there's blood on the walls and charlie
And the family made house calls. If you're alone then watch

Madness, yeah, bloodbath in paradise, but there's no where

Bloodbath in paradise, but there's no where you break out baby,
Bloodbath in paradise, forever sleep in paradise.

Well I know I could be just another stranger, but to you I
Guess I'm just another fool. And you swear you like to live
Your life in danger, then you hide behind a wall of silly lies.

Nobody think the way I do, I guess that nobody cares. Your
Head's so full of things, so set your mind free of them, I'm
Breaking the rules.

Did you know that in the truth, there's nothing stranger. I
Suppose you think I think I know it all.

Nobody hears the things I say, I guess nobody cares. My
Head's so full of things I set my mind free. I'm
Breaking the rules, breaking all the rules, can't you see they're
Nothing without you, empty heads full of fools. Now you see
I'm breaking all the rules, breakin' all the rules.

Well I know that you would love to go to heaven but you
Know that you're just too afraid to die. And I know that you
Would love to know the answers but to you the truth is just
Another lie.

Nobody hears the things I say, I guess nobody cares. My
Head's so full of things I set my mind free of them. I'm
Breaking the rules, breaking all the rules, can't you see they're
Nothing without you, empty heads full of fools, now you see
I'm breaking all the rules, breaking all the rules.
Breaking all the rules, why don't you tell them, breaking all
The rules, now come on, breaking all the rules,
Why don't you get it on, breaking all the rules.
There's no present there's no future
I don't even know about the past
It's all timeless and never ending
To take it in it's all too vast
It goes, forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tomorrow
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
The time is coming but also going
And it's leaving never to return
Maybe forever it could be heaven
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn
It goes, forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tomorrow
I got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavor
But forever is a long long time
There's no secrets and no corruption
In the center of infinity
There's no limits in non-existence
And no beginning to my destiny
It goes, forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tomorrow
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
I feel unhappy
I am so sad
I've lost the best friend
That I ever had
She is my baby
I love her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go
We're going through changes (ooh) 
We're going through changes (ah, ah, ah) 
We've shared the years 
We've shared each day 
I love you daddy 
But I found my way 
You know the world 
Is an evil place?
My baby is grown now 
She's found her way 
(Ah ah ah, ooh) 
We're going through changes (ah ah, ooh) 
We're going through changes
(Ah, ah, ah) 
It took so long 
To realize 
And I can still hear 
His last goodbyes (bye bye)
Now all my days (ooh)
I'm filled with fears 
Wish I could go back (come back)
And change the years (change the years)
We're going through changes (changes) 
We're going through changes (changes) 
We're going through
Changes 
Changes 
Changes
Changes
Revolution in their minds - the children start to march 
Against the world in which they have to live 
And all the hate that's in their hearts 
They're tired of being pushed around 
And told just what to do 
They'll fight the world until they've won 
And love comes flowing through 
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today 
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way? 
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear? 
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? 
So you children of the world, 
Listen to what I say 
If you want a better place to live in 
Spread the words today 
Show the world that love is still alive 
You must be brave 
Or you children of today are 
Children of the grave, yeah!
Found exploding, and tears are growing
Chasing rockets and grasping my head
They can call it justice, a retribution
But the reasons are never clear
Freedom is just mans' invention
And a soldier is just a slave
Self inflicted
So addicted
Our habits are hard to break
[Chorus:]
I'm alive
Watching better turn to worse
(Watching better turn to worse)
One more time
Try to civilize the universe
(Civilize the universe)
Without the righteous
Without the faithful
We would never accept the obscene
A false confession, and priest's obsession
Is the demon the light to be seen
Burn the witch and hang his head as
There's only one choice to be made
With thought restricted
And heart afflicted
The truth be so hard to take
[Chorus]
The righteous and the faithful
Give the good man to the blind
The world full of confusion
From every disease confined
[Chorus x2]
Try to civilize the universe
(Civilize the universe)
Baby, I get so scared inside and I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind or is it fantasy?
Heaven is in the palm of my hand and it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Sometimes it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger, and stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in your warm and darkend grave?

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?  No I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?  No I'll never feel the same

I know I've been so hard on you; I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish, I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?
Watching blood stain windows
He must just love the blame
See the children crying
His mother's died again
Dig her grave much deeper
The fatal price you pay
I hope I'm there to hold her
When she comes back again
I see the death and the disaster
There is no happy ever after
The time has come
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Is the Armageddon
Finally here at last
You may see the mushroom
But you won't hear the blast
Don't need a self made prophet
Don't need a holy war
Don't need another D-day
To even up the score
I'm cursed with living on a goldmine
The doomsday clock was built by mankind
No place to run
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
I see the death and the disaster
There is no happy ever after
The time has come
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun

I will tell you I'm OK, but deep inside I'm afraid
I don't drink holy water, I'm not a son of Christ
I ain't no black messiah, and I don't load my dice
You can tell me you're all right, but why you so afraid?
You're in denial, you never will believe it's you
Denial, you always hide behind the truth
You'll never believe it, you never believe it's you
I don't think I'm amazing, in fact I'm quite insane
To live inside my bucket, with all my plastic chains

Devil's daughter
The time has come at last
Your future days have past
No use in fighting battles you can't win

There's no guarantee what you get is what you see, 
Don't try to find it,just don't try, 
Don't try living in the past,if you want your dreams to last, 
Don't hide behind the mask of lies, 
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby, 
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere 
It's a vision,not religion, 
And the truth is plain to see, 
It's a feeling,it's revealing, 
So don't blame me [Repeat x4] 
Deep inside of me,lives a hunger to be free, 
I know I'll have to pay the prize, 
I may never know when it comes or when it goes, 
I guess it's just a part of life? 
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby, 
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere, 
It's a vision,it's religion, 
And the truth is plain to see, 
It's a feeling,it's revealing, 
Nowhere you can hide,

Gazing through the window at the world outside
Wondering will Mother Earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her, sometime
After all there's only just the two of us
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself, time after time
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days
I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those who will come after us, this time
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days
Your higher power maybe God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really matter much to me
Without each others help there ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah yeah yeah!
If only we could all just find serenity
It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away (today)
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days (okay)
I'm just a dreamer, who's searching for the way (today)
I'm just a dreamer, dreaming my life away (oh yeah yeah yeah)
You make promise of protection
To a future after life
To the final resurrection
And to eternal paradise
But then I'm blinded with temptation
And to every mortal sin
Is it god that sits there waiting? 
Or will the darkness suck me in
Let's wake up the dead oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell
Oh the children sit and listen
The belief was in their eyes
In a land without tomorrows
Through the night you hear their cries
But then your eyes just skip the pages
Of a book that never ends
Is it god that sits there waiting? 
Do you hear the call again? 
Let's wake up the dead oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell
It's just crazy world we live in and I'm out of my mind
You pray tomorrow but your leaving today
Evil one is coming and he's knocking your door
'Cause today's the day you'll pay
Let's wake up the dead oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
Let's wake up the dead oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know

Goin' home, late last night 
Suddenly I got a fright 
Yeah I looked thought the window and surprised what I saw 
Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now! 
Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me 
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies 
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me 
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now! 
So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me 
He said "Son, son, you've gone too far. 
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."
No prayers left for heroes,
The dead won't see the ending,
War started by rich men
Won't stop the poor from dying

I'll grant you, your death wish,
It's not just time I'm killing,
Blood's thicker than water,
It's too late to surrender

This will be your last stand,
I wash the blood from my hands

I am warrior,
I'm fearless
No pain,
No mercy,
No weakness,
I, I, I'm fearless

I answer no questions,
You will obey my order,
I'll punish all sinners,
This battle has no borders

No saving salvation,
Your soul is stained and rusted,
I follow no leader,
My vigilante justice

I'd rather die on my feet
Than live a life on my knees

I am warrior,
I'm fearless
No pain,
No mercy,
No weakness,
I, I, I'm fearless

My skin and bones drip off of me,
I'm more than man, more than machine

This will be your last stand,
I wash the blood from my hands

I am warrior,
I'm fearless
No pain,
No mercy,
No weakness,

The introduction to his heartache began as a child 
So it's no wonder that he grew up to be so wild. 
So he protected his feelings in walls he imagined 
But castles crumble exposing the frightened child.
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.
In solitude he couldn't deal with his own existence, 
The burning questions in the castles have still remained. 
God only knows how he searched in vain for the answers, 
Now castles crumble exposing his naked flames, yeah.
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.

I hear you breathing though
You're so far away
Can you just go where you're
Going to
I couldn't give a damn or two
About a fool like you
That's true
Are you just too cool no
You're just perfectly cold
And what goes around still
Comes around
I think it's all summed up and
Down in a fool like you
That's true
Today is just another day
You hold your ticket into
Nowhere
It's up to you if you will stay
And turn your day into a
Nightmare

You think you know it you think
You know it all
But you don't even have a clue
And control is still in view for
A fool like you
That's true
Is there a reason for the way
That you are
Or does it just come naturally
To have an idiosyncrasy and be
A fool like you
That's true

You're hearing what you want
To hear
Misunderstanding all you see
An attitude in all of us
Is it really you and me

He's hiding residing deep within
The crowd
A hand out he'll pull you down

You've been found guilty
Committed every crime
But still they say you must go
Free

There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everyone's wrong
People speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind
Yeah, stop children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
What a field-day for the heat
Ten thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away
Stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

You better stop!

But I still love the feeling I get from you,
I hope you'll never stop 'cause' it gets me through yeah

Sometimes reality's unkind
The nightmares stalk for me at night

There is person living in my head
She comes to visit every night in bed
I fight the demon, but it just won't fall
The voices in my dungeon starting to call
The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you, you are the ghost behind my eyes
The ghost that tells me lies
The princess of the dark has made my mind home
My haunted head and her won't leave me alone
She dances on my heart with fire in my soul
I hate that feeling when I'm loosing control
The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you, you are the ghost behind my eyes
The ghost that tells me lies
I wish to god that I could sleep again, oh peace again
And wake up from this nightmare   
Free again
Free again, oh me again
There is a woman in my head
She comes to visit every night in bed
The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you, you are the ghost behind my eyes

Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough

When I was young I was the nicest guy I knew
I thought I was the chosen one
But time went by and I found out a thing or two
My shine wore off as time wore on
I thought that I was living out the perfect life
But in the lonely hours when the truth begins to bite
I thought about the times when I turned my back & stalled
I ain't no nice guy after all
When I was young I was the only game in town
I thought I had it down for sure,
But time went by and I was lost in what I found
The reasons blurred, the way unsure
I thought that I was living life the only way
But as I saw that life was more than day to day
I turned around, I read the writing on the wall
I ain't no nice guy after all
I ain't no nice guy after all
In all the years you spend between your birth and death
You find there's lots of times you should have saved your breath
It comes as quite a shock when that trip leads to fall
People look to me and say
Is the end near, when is the final day
What's the future of mankind
How do I know, I got left behind
Everyone goes through changes
Looking to find the truth
Don't look at me for answers
Don't ask me - I don't know
How am I supposed to know
Hidden meanings that will never show
Fools and prophets from the past

Ya gotta believe in someone asking me who is right,
Asking me who to follow, don't ask me, I don't know,
I don't know - I don't know - I don't know
Nobody ever told me I found out for myself
Ya gotta believe in foolish miracles
It's not how you play the game
It's if you win or lose you can choose
Don't confuse win or lose, it's up to you
It's up to you - it's up to you - it's up to you

What is the purpose
Demonoid phenomenon
Regulate the flux and reflux
So bring it on
Loose upon the world
Destruct a juggernaut

Suddenly the rats are high
Bleed the masses and watch'em cry
Slumber like Houdini's dog
Die alone out in the fog

Iron head- regenerate
Iron head-exterminate
Iron head-liberate and crucify you

What is my name
Demonoid phenomenon
Laugh in your face and
Break because you don't belong
Vent upon the brink
Appear another demi-god

Suddenly forever knows
What it takes and where it goes
Paint it black inside your head
I defy what you have said
I am Iron Man
Come on let's go fuck you up
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all?
Or if he moves will he fall?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
Come on you fuckers
God bless you all
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
They just turn their head
Nobody helps him
Now he waits in regret
I wanna hear everybody now, come on
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their head
Nobody helps him
So he waits in regret
Alright let's see a fucking wild call
Come on
Come on
Go fucking crazy
A Monday morning earthquake
Another week to back break
Keep him alive all the day
High and dry I wonder will he survive
I broke a mirror and it started us out
It was an all night shelter of love
He swallowed down another fantasy pill
To give himself a push and a shove
Tonight's the night he's going to jump the moon
I hope it'll never crush a man to soon
He's just an image of a lie tonight
He's just a press we follow
Live today like he'll be gone tomorrow
Another daylight foreigner
He's just a weekend warrior
Come Monday play like anyone
Not around and turned around
He only listens to the voice in his head
That separate the truths from the lies
A wounded creature that just won't fall down
You can tell by the look in his eyes
Tonight's the night he's going to jump the moon
I hope it'll never crush a man to soon
He's just an image of a lie tonight
He's just a press we follow
Live today like he'll be gone tomorrow
Whoa
He's flying high with his silver spoon
Oh
He's here to try to jump the, jump the
Yeah jump the moon
Tonight's the night he's going to jump the moon
I hope it'll never crush a man to soon
He's just an image of a lie tonight
He's just a press we follow
Live today like he'll be gone tomorrow
Oh!
Tonight's the night he's going to jump the moon
He's just an image of a lie tonight
He's just a press we follow
Live today like he'll be gone tomorrow
You're coming down badly
You're crippled inside
A rat in your sewer
You've no place to hide
A gut wrenching fever
Addicted to death
You don't give a fuck
If it means your last breath
You try so hard to quit
But you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why
'Cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie
You crave for the needle to stick in your vein
Can't for the poison to kill all the pain
You buy your cheap ticket to take a short ride
That beautiful flower is eating your mind
You try so hard to quit
But you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why
'Cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie
Your name means nothing
You don't know the score
Body is aching you still crave for more
Sometimes you wish that you'd never been born
Tormenting came with a crown full of thorns
You're chasing the dragon you're chasing the high
A bird with one wing
Who's still trying to fly
You're all out of spirit
A dead man alive
A born again junkie
You'll never survive
You try so hard to quit
But you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why
'Cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie
Junkie
Junkie
Junkie
Junkie
If none of us believe in war
Then can you tell me what the weapon's for
Listen to me everyone
If the button is pushed
There'll be nowhere to run

Giants sleeping giants winning wars
Within their dreams
Till they wake when it's too late
And in god's name blaspheme

Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Marches of protest not stopping the war
Or the killer of giants
The killer of giants

Mother nature people state
Your case without its worth
Your seas run dry
Your sleepless eyes are turning red alert

Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Rising so proudly it has nowhere to fall
This killer of giants
This killer of giants

Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Marches of protest not stopping the war
Oh the killer of giants
Oh the killer of giants
Killer of giants
Killer of giants
Another day and another full seizure
Another pill, you spiral down deeper
Another cut by a surgical butcher
It's just a way of prolonging the torture
I won't say I don't know what I'm doing
I won't say that I'm sorry
I can't bring you back but I can't leave you helpless
I'll make the pain rest in peace
I'll turn off the light and
Swallow your last breath
So close your eyes, fall asleep
I'll never hurt you
I'll never hurt you
The sun shines on this deadly new morning
The church bells ring an early warning
Your eyes shine as I turn on the motor
The tears fall as the mercy gets closer
I won't say I don't know what I'm doing
I won't say that I'm sorry
I can't bring you back but I can't leave you helpless
I'll make the pain rest in peace

Swallow your last breath
So close your eyes, fall asleep
I'll never hurt you
I can't bring you back but I can't leave you helpless
I'll make the pain rest in peace
I'll turn off the light and
Swallow your last breath
So close your eyes, fall asleep
I'll never hurt you
I know you think you're all alone
I haven't been there when you needed me
I didn't deserve the love you gave
But now I'm telling you "I'm here, if you need a friend"
Give me your pain
Give me your anger
Let me be your rock
I can be the pillar of strength that you need
I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never
Lay your world on me
I can take the weight
Don't let it twist you up inside
Time never fails to make the heartache stop
You've gotta let those feelings go
I'll give you everything I can
If you say the word
Give me your pain
Give me your anger
Let me be your rock
I can be the pillar of strength that you need
I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never
Lay your world on me
I can take the weight
We all live and we all cry
We all hurt the same inside
We all fall down
Then we lose faith and who we really are
But if we bend instead of break
The choice for us is to make it together
Lay your world on me
I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never
Lay your world on me
Lay your world on me
Lay your world on me
I can take the weight

I watch it all change,
Take the news of the day
And throw it away
Time will kill all the pain,
Fate will cure the decay of all this blind ambition,
The greed brings us together
Stand strong,
Stay true,
Be brave,
It all comes down to you
Try to just let it go,
Know that just is too slow,
But it comes in the end
Rise, the guilty will fall,
Stay, they can't take it all; they want the unimportant,
It's love they leave behind
Stand up,
Aim true,
Keep heart,
The future looks to you
Every second you throw away,
Every minute of every day,
Don't get caught in a memory,
Cause life won't wait for you,
No, life won't wait for you, my friend
I'm watching a change,
Who will carry the flame?
It all feels very strange
Dreams that men can be good,
Faith to live as we should and know we're all connected,
We give ourselves the power
Stay strong,
Stay true,
Be brave,
It all comes down to you
Every day that you wait, you're falling faster,
No slide of hand,
No twist of fate,
No ever after
When it's gone, it's gone,
A fight 'til the bitter end,
Life won't wait for you,
No, life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
Won't you listen 'cos I'm at it

Lightning striking and on that
You can depend
They say that lightning never
Strikes the same place twice
Gods of thunder sit and watch
The event
You know I take no prisoners
My back's to the wall
You know I must be going
When destiny calls
Until I feel that thunder
Shattering my brain

Times gone by seems to be
You could have been a better friend to me
Mama, I'm coming home

I'm looking for a miracle man that tells me no lies
I'm looking for a miracle man who's not in disguise
I don't know where he'll come from and I don't know where he's been
But he's not our Jimmy sinner because he's so obscene
Miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted
Today i saw a miracle man, on TV cryin'
Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying
He don't know where he's goin' but we know where he's been
It was out little Jimmy sinner 
Our eyes are on the screen
Miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted, miracle
man got busted, miracle man
A devil with a crucifix
Brimstone and fire
He needs another carnal fix
To take him higher and higher
Now Jimmy, he got busted with his pants down
Repent ye wretched sinners, self righteous clown
Miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted, miracle
man got busted, miracle man got busted, miracle man got
busted, miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted

Manmade and a bit obscene

Condemned to violence
Arrested by pain
Inside the soul lies a man insane
Conceived in anger
Addicted to hate
The mutant child of a twisted state
Beware the contradiction
Beneath the crimson void
'Cause in the world of fiction
My Jekyll doesn't hide
A killer's smile with
A psycho star dream
Behind the mask things aren't what they seem
Unholy soldier
Disciple of sin
What kind of mind are you living in
You're preaching revolution
Don't you mean genocide?
Behind this resolution
My Jekyll doesn't hide
Waiting to die for the every first time
All right, that's right
Waiting to die for the every first time
I don't give a damn, 'cause I think it's my time, my time
The symbiosis
Of murder and lies
What do I see looking through your disguise?
Fourth Reich dementia
Subversion ideals
God only knows what your secret conceals
Who'll be the first offender?
Who will be victimized?
In your perverse agenda
My Jekyll doesn't hide
Don't you know I love you more than life itself,
Don't you know that you're my pride
And I would not have you walking through this world.
Without me by your side
Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man
I'd like to keep you with me all your life,
But I know I can't do that
So I must try to teach you wrong from right,
To keep the vulture from your back
Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man
And when you're dreaming you can talk to angels,
So wipe the tears from your eyes
And if there's demons that try to steal you breath away.
You can't believe that, know my spirit will be standing by your side
You saved me, you gave me, the greatest gift of all
Believe me, believe, there ain't no mountain that's too tall
I will gladly carry your cross for you,
To take your pain away
But what I can't carry is my love for you,
Beyond my dying day
So be strong my little man
When I'm gone my little man
You got to be my little man
So don't you weep my little man
Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man
You got to be my little man
So don't you weep my little man
Oh yeah
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal
Oh yeah
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'till the end of time
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand
Is it the voice of your laughter
That echoes in vain
In the vessel of your sorrow
And pain
It is the beat of a heart that
You hear in your mind
Something's missing but you
Cannot explain

You've searched your soul for
Feeling
Over and over now over and
Over now
There is no use in dreaming
Over and over now over and
Over now

It is the chain that you're
Dragging
That was once your relief
That's like everything that's
Born to die
And the birth of a doubt that
Was once your belief
Is drowning in the tears that
You cry

It all remains a mystery
For ever and ever now
Ever and ever now
The things that were are
History
Forever and ever now
Ever and never now

It's never too later to cry
It's never too late for
Goodbyes
It's never too later to cry
You know you were born to die

If the messiah is coming
Will he be too late
To reconcile our tears with
Our hate
And the memory of freedom
That imprisons our heart
And we're greeted by the cold
Hand of fate

It's never too later to cry
It's never too late for
Goodbyes
It's never too later to cry
You know you were born to die
If we're offensive and pose a
Threat
You fear what we represent is
A mess
You've missed the message
That says it all
And you'll never know hy
Oh no you'll never know why

We rock

It's just a feeling how we
Excite
You cannot rule everybody in
Sight
But you condemn don't
Understand

Oh no you'll never know hwy

We rock rock rock
We rock rock rock
We rock rock rock
You'll never know why

I leave you cold and in disgust
Don't try to tame me you'll eat

One, two, one, two, three
Silver screen such a disgrace
I couldn't look her straight in the face
A blue addiction I live in disgust
Degradation I'm being eaten by lust
No bone movies

Inspiration that's blue and uncut
Can't kick the habit obsession of smut
Voyeur straining in love with his hand
A poison passion a pulsating gland

Looking to the mirror
From the other side
Seeing her reflection
And it blows my mind
Trying to deny it 
But damage is done
I'll just run as always
But the race is run
You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out
Read the daily fiction, Superman is dead
Crushing coins of silver, imitating lead 
Then if you will fix the children of the past 
I guess their's isn't welcome, doesn't time move fast 
You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out
Night in the shadow of man 
This is the dawn of the dead
Don't let it live in your head
And then now as the sabbath begins
It wakes your nightmare again
So run away if you can
So just run
Run as fast as you can
You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
Too late too tell me it's over now
Falling apart at the seams
No angel sits on my shoulders now
I hold my head and it screams
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out
The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Your mamma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror and tell me do you think your life's in danger here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, these were our first
Its just a hand in the bush
A hand in the bush

So now that it's over can't we just say good-bye? (bye-bye, bye-bye)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say

I never wanted it to end this way my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love I think
I'm falling here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

It's just a hand in the bush
(In the bush, in the bush, in the bush)
Don`t tell me I'm wrong
Don't tell that you knew all along
I won't roll over dead
Only I know whats goes on my head
I've nothing to hide
I'm not guilty inside
I won't give up
After all I'm still crazy
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Try so hard to break me
But all your diamonds turn to sand
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Say goodbye forever
I'll wait for you in no man's land
Get out of my way
There's nothing you can do to change what I say
I won't ever let go
I got the answer but you'll never know
I got my eyes open wide
Ain't gonna slip up or slide
Can't take me down
After all I'm still crazy
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Try so hard to break me
But all your diamonds turn to sand
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Say goodbye forever
I'll wait for you in no man's land
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Try so hard to break me
But all your diamonds turn to sand
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Say goodbye forever
I'll wait for you in no man's land
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going away
I'm not going
Say goodbye forever
I'll wait for you in no man's land
Overbearing woman makin' it so hard for me
Now you've laid it down for all to see
Can I ask a question, d'ya think you can take a
Blow
This is why I always come and go.

Now you see it, now you don't
Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music. Take it like a man
Givin' it to me anyway you can

Everybody's feeling everything you've got to
Feel
I've got something that you can conceal

Now you see it
Now you don't
Now you see it
Now you don't

Give me central heating hope that I can pay the
Bill

Makin me forget my fear of hell
Myst be luck in odd numbers now you face me
Upside down
I'm so far up I'm afraid to come back down
I don't walk, I stalk, living foul like pork
Shutting down underground streets of New York
Hawk is what the niggas call me, 'cause they all be
Sucking my dick and my mother fucking balls, G
I know the half, so I laugh with 'em
Blood bath when I let the fucking rap hit 'em
Full clip, but only half did 'em,
That's all it took, another crook taken out over a dirty look
I bag game with niggas I leave shot dead
You're not taking a fucking thing from me but hot lead
You know my style, fagot, 'cause I'm always scheming
In Jail, niggas holdin' a sink, screaming
Police! But you got no peace
Yo, was that you, big man, and a lot more grease?
All I gets is pounds, you ain't want none of this
Back streets are like track meets 'cause I be running this
Ain't nowhere to run, ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go, Reaper's saved your soul
Surrounded by the colors, I see crimson, black, and blue
Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you
Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do?
Sister of the universe, selecting me in time
I'm falling down upon the Earth and singing truth in rhyme
If I was a rolling stone, I'd roll until I'm through,
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you!
Ain't nowhere to run, ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go, Reaper's saved your soul
Argh, yargh, yargh, yargh
Ain't nowhere to run, ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go, Reaper's saved your soul
What you motherfuckers invented
Is the craziest nigga that ever been invented
Most know, don't front on Ol' Dity Bastard
I call on Jesus
There's no obstacles that you have to jump
There's no walls that you have to climb
This is real, this is elementary, dear, elementary, Watson
Elementary, argh!
I ain't no picture on your fucking wall, necklace-wearing bitch
You don't want this money till it's rich
Buy my album, coded by Dirty, set you free
Go against the grain, I got the P
I know you don't recognize me now, I done cocooned
How many lightning bolts do it take to light up a fucking moon?
Brothers, people, you'd better get the fuck off of me
We don't need it, it gets more ugly
Fools tryin' to bust their ass,
Tryin' to get away from me when I said my real name
I call myself in the bitch butthole
All the same, all the same, all the same
Ain't nowhere to run, ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go, Reaper's saved your soul
Look into the future
Look into my eyes and tell me everything's all right
Tell me where we're going
I'm so afraid 'cause I don't know what's going on with my life
But it'll be all right tonight
Will it be all right tonight?
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?
Sitting by the ocean
Mapping out my plans of action, baby they include you
I wish you'd send a message
Maybe I'm just better off not knowing who knew
But it'll be all right tonight
I'm gonna be all right tonight
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
Who could you imagine such a thing could happen to you?
It's gonna be all right in old L.A.
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces
It's gonna be all right in old L.A. tonight
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain? Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
Into the night I've gotta go
That's when the juices start to flow
Everything will be alright
I might be blind but I can see
I got the power inside of me
Everything will be alright
I'm never gonna crack under a witch's spell
Never put her chain's on me
I'm never gonna break it
No I'll never tell
I know she'll never let me be
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed no more
I like it fast, I like it slow
There's no direction I couldn't go
Everything will be alright
I like it loud, I like it mean
I got the thunder in my machine
Everything will be alright
Dancing with disaster is a part of me
I'm never gonna let it go
Don't know what I'm after I'm deserting me
The secret that I'll never know
On his way to dinner when it took him by surprise
And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight
Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life
Then a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife
I don't mind, single file down the runway
Feelin' fine and I see you, my friend
Over and over again
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Again
Riding painted horses, oh the kids they love it so
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
Minding my own business like my mama always said
But if I don't try to help 'em they could wind up on the front page
I don't mind, draw the line, then draw me an arrow
Feelin' fine, then I'll see you, my friend
Over and over again
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Again
Wake me when it's over, tell me it's all right
Just keep on talking, baby, I've been doing this all night
How much did you give me, tell me it'll be all right
Then I'll see you, my friend
Over and over again
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Again, again, again
Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah
When I look up to the sky
I see your eyes in a funny kind of yellow
I rush to bed I soak my head
I see your face underneath my pillow
I wake next morning tossed and yawning
I see your face come peeping through my window
Oh no
Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah
Pictures of matchstick men and you
Images of matchstick men and you
All I ever see is them and... you
Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah
Windows echo your reflection
When I look in their direction
Gone
Yeah they're gone
When will this haunting stop
Your face just won't leave me alone
Oh no
Pictures of matchstick men and you
Images of matchstick men and you
All I ever see is them and you
Oh you're in the sky
You're with this guy
You make men cry, you lie
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
I can see those matchstick men
I can see those matchstick men
I can see those matchstick men
I can see those matchstick men
I can see those matchstick men
I can see those matchstick men

The only time he's feeling good is when he'd killed and killed again
When he's killed again

I was looking back on my life
And all the things I've done to me
I'm still looking for the answers
And I'm still searching for the key
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
It just won't leave me alone
I still find it all a mystery
Could it be a dream?
The road to nowhere leads to me
Through all the happiness and sorrow
I guess I'd do it all again
Live for today and not tomorrow
It's still the road that never ends
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
It just won't leave me alone
I still find it all a mystery
Could it be a dream?
The road to nowhere leads to me
Ah ah, the road to nowhere's gonna pass me by
Ah ah, I hope we never have to say goodbye
I never want to live without you (oh yeah)
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
It just won't leave me alone
I still find it all a mystery
Could it be a dream?
The road to nowhere leads to me
The road to nowhere leads to me
The road to nowhere leads to me
You got to, got to, got to lead to me
The road to nowhere leads to me
You got to, got to, got to lead to me
You got to, got to, got to lead to me
Ah, the road to nowhere
They couldn't see what i thought would be so
Obvious
They hide behind the laws they make for all of
Us.
The ministry of truth at deals with pretense
The ministry of peace that sits on defense
I'm washing my hands of what they're tryin' to
Do
I'm breaking the rules and its for me and for you.

I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They think i workship the devil
They only see through his eyes
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel.

They live their lives in fear and insecurity
And all you do is pay for their prosperity
The ministry of fear that won't let you live
The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive
Do what you will to try and make me conform
But i'll make you wish that you had never been
Born
Cause i'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll do as i please
I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'm a free as the breeze
I'm a just rock 'n' roll rebel

They'll try playin with your heart
They know it rules your head
They only feel what bigotry feels
They won't fool me again (oh no)

God only knows why they couldn't see that
Obvious
Is it because they manifest the incubus
The ministry of war that got caught in the draught
The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed
When its all boild down and the days at the end
I'll give you no bullshit and i'll never pretend
Cause i'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say i workship the devil
Why don't they open their eyes
Spent the last year
Rocky mountain way
Couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture
I think it's safe to say
Time to open fire
And we don't need the ladies
Crying 'cause the story's sad, oh yeah
'cause the rocky mountain way
Is better than the way we had
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Rocky mountain way, oh

Well he's tellin' us this,
He's tellin' us that,
Changin' it everyday
Say's it doesn't matter
Bases are loaded and casey's at bat
Playin' it play by play
It's time to change the batter

And we don't need the ladies
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad
'Cause the rocky mountain way
Is better than the way we had
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Rocky mountain way

And we don't need the ladies
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad
'Cause the rocky mountain way
Is better than the way we had
It's better than the way we had
It's better than the way we had
So much better
So much better
It's so much better
It's so much better

Rocky mountain way
Been around this world so many times
If you could only see my mind
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell
Faith alone has guided me
The ghost of my own destiny
I haven't even got a soul to sell
All the thing I put me through
I wouldn't wish my hell on you
You'll never know what's going on inside
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
Trouble always seems find
A way to live inside my mind
My haunted head and me remain alone
Underneath my masquerade
A simple man who's so afraid
I try to find a light to guide me home
Momma please just hold me tight
Feeling so afraid tonight
'Cause your the only one that really knows
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
Fighting for my sanity
Many nights of tragedy
Got to leave my Wretched ways behind
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of fate and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
Underneath my masquerade a simple who's still afraid
You've seen life through distorted eyes
You know you had to learn
The execution of your mind
You really had to turn
The race is run the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
And now there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom
Could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again
The light of day

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

Where can you run to
What more can you do
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion
Nothing more to tell

Everything around you
What's it coming to
God knows as your dog knows
Bog blast all of you
Sabbath Bloody Sabbath
Nothing more to do
Living just for dying
Dying just for you
Trapped in a lonely body I'm
Losin' control
Can't show my emotions and I'm
Losing my soul
Could it be that I'm obsessed
With feeding my disease
I couldn't make it know that
Hidden things that no one
Sees
Yeah loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Fighting a losing battle
Pretending to win
Repenting to holy unknowns
Pretending to sin
All i do is hide the wounds
Where blood just
Won't congeal
Couldn't ever take my soul
'Cause isn't there to steal
Yeah loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Though I'm the loser there is
No winner
There's nothing left to win
The hidden reasons now in
Deletion
Are lost in sin
So heed my warning the time is
Dawning
I'll tell you here's the twist
The truth is lying
Below the surface i don't exist
Loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Seeing is not believing it don't
Mean a thing
Although it appears to be that
The loser is king
I can understand that what
You see you think is real
But underneath the surface is
A wound that cannot heal
Yeah loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Voices, a thousand, thousand voices
Whispering, the time has passed for choices
Golden days are passing over, yeah

I can't seem to see you baby
Although my eyes are open wide
But I know I'll see you once more
When I see you, I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side

Leaving, I hate to see you cry
Grieving, I hate to say goodbye
Dust and ash forever, yeah

Though I know we must be parted
As sure as stars are in the sky
I'm gonna see when it comes to glory
And I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side
Yes I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side

Never thought I'd feel like this
Strange to be alone, yeah
But we'll be together
Carved in stone, carved in stone, carved in stone

Hold me, hold me tight, I'm falling
Far away. Distant voices calling
I'm so cold. I need you darling, yeah

I was down, but now I'm flying
Straight across the great divide
I know you're crying, but I'll stop you crying
When I see you, I see you on the other side
Yes. I'll see you. See you on the other side
I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah

I'll see you. See you on the other side
I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah

Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents  on the verge of drastic
Ways, can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes  I think I'm slowly dying

Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me please  all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe  and I can hardly take it

Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out

Lost, ran at my own cost, hearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak, all around me, weak, listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one your dogging

I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying

You all stare, but you'll never see
There is something inside me
There is something in you I despise

Cut me, show me, enter, I am
Willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way
I can't die

You will see
Purity
I play doctor for five minutes flat
Before I cut my heart open, and let the air out
Three bugs, a pound of dust
Some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had
Broke away my tear spout
As I lie there
With my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me
A sweetheart tube
As I injected
The candied heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate
Just do what you have to do to me!
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red cause I can't feel!
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time,
It's time 
It's time
It's time
Biding (my time)
Biding (my time)
Biding (my time)
Biding
I play doctor for five minutes flat
Before I cut my heart open
And let the air out
Three bugs, a pound of dust
Some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had
Broke away my tear spout!

As I lie here
With my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me
A sweetheart tube
As I injected
The candid heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate
Just do what you like to do to me!

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin.
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel.
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway.
Just let the blood run red, 'cause I can't feel!

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin.
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel.
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway.
Just let the blood run red, 'cause I can't feel!

Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time
It's time!

Biding my time until the time is right!
Biding my time until the time is right!
Biding my time until the time is right!
Biding my time
It's time!

Biding my time until the time is right!
Biding my time until the time is right!

Someone inside me
Everyone against me

Everyone beside me
Clawing away

The pieces
Scratching away
The absence

One more
Two more
Everyone, once more

One more
Two more
Everyone, once more

Inside the places that I hide from you
I want to see you spread before me
You, are, the only one, that I would rather see
Before me!

Scream!
Fell forth, destroy the source,
can't see and my voice is horse,
Trying to wash your hands off,
You should know better than to leave us in disgust,
Let me take you right to the point,
All you ever do is encage in disjoint,
That does it the time has arrived,
Take it or leave it you better not side!
You did it again,
All you ever did was doubt,
What do you want?
Let me tell you what it's all about,
One life
Nine Hearts
And Eighteen Hands that'll rip you all apart
We're here to decimate,
To show you all we will never fall,
Its gonna get serious, and critical,
Don't Stop because the feeling is terminal,
[Chorus]
Scream!
Scream like you never have before,
Scream!
Scream till you can't scream anymore,
Scream !
Scream like your throat is bleeding,
Scream!
Scream till your heart stops beating,
Scream for me!
Get off of me, and get away,
Show the whole damn world this will never die,
No matter how the energies scatter,
Got to know nothing exists but the dream,
Give it all,
Till There's nothing left to give,
Save it all,
Quit saving you,
If you're going to let the pain inside,
Never under estimate the way you live your life,
[Chorus]
All our lives,
All we ever sacrificed has paid,
Everything,
Everything is possible to me,
Why no fate,
Found everything that I had to take away,
Save your life,
Save it all that mean something to me,
All our lives
All we ever sacrificed has paid,
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fight!
Found everything that I had to take away,
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way,
This stress, is a feeling that you can't compress,
Everything your going through is total stress,
Are you going to be a momentary run around,
How will you handle their ? of stress,
All our lives,
All we ever sacrificed has paid,
Everything,
Everything is possible to me,
Why no fight,
Found everything that I had to take away,
Save your life,
Save it all and make a better way,
All our lives,
All we ever sacrificed has paid,
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fight!
Found everything that I had to take away,
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way,
Scream!
Zero and zero is nothing but zero
Cancer and people conspire together
Running and running and going forever
Collected and sampled, starving for zero

Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain

Minus the inside and minus the circle
Inhabit the riddle and fill in the hovel
Wherein and herein, between us and near us
Zero and zero is nothing but zero

Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain

Keeping myself alive
Through your empathy
Keeping myself alive
Through your empathy
Keeping myself alive
Through your empathy
Keeping myself alive
Through your empathy

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again
So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate, if I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
My smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint
My own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
My love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again
So if you love me let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh, my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your lights
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight
So save your breath, I will not care

You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend

And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh, my love was punished long ago
If you still care don't ever let me know
If you still care don't ever let me know
Did you never give a damn in the first place
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty
Man nearly killed me
Steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll you were dead from the get-go!
Big mouth fucker stupid cocksucker
Are you scared of me now?
Then you're dumber than I thought
Always is and never was
Foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya think I fear ya? bullshit!
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this shit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
Gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, literal profanity, hit me!

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lotta rumor fodder
Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realize
Step up, fairy
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome straight to the dome
You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
And if you know what's good just shut up and beg, brother
Back stab don't you know who you're dissin'?
Side swipe we know the ass that you're kissin'!
Biggity-biggidy bitch boy, halfway hauser
Don't hear shit 'cause it keeps gettin' louder
Come up and get a face full o'tactic
Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no nothin'
Now you start shit? Well ain't that somethin'?
Payoffs don't protect and you can hide if you want
But I'll find you comin' up behind you!

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

'Bout time I set this record straight
'Cause' all the needlenose punchin' is makin' me irate
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
Where you gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools and all the politics
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got dick when they passed out the good stuff
Bam are you sick of me?, good enough had enough

Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is spit you out
Spit, spit
Spit, spit
Spit it out
My guilt and my shame always sell me short,
Always feel the same
And my face and my soul always wear me thin,
Always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on

So let me get this straight, the only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it, or die

Stay, you don't always know where you stand
Till you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur

My life is undone, and I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my gods are untrue, I'm probably wrong, but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe, but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive

Stay, you don't always know where you stand
Till you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur

Like breathing in sulfur
Stay, you don't always know where you stand
Till you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur
Stay, you don't always know where you stand
Till you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Fuck you all!
Running out of ways to run

Fuck it all! fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! don't exist!

Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this cause you're never gonna get me

Tattered and torn
Something aches
Tattered and torn
Bad things slither
Tattered and torn

Tattered and torn

Tattered and torn
In the space of a second
Tattered and torn
Open my wrists
Tattered and torn
Give me my lessons
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me hurt!
One, two, three!
Yeah!
Drop it!
Bones in the water and dust in my lungs
Absorbing archaic like a sponge
The ultimate way is the way you control
But you can stay if you detach your soul
Bury the present and squeeze out the past
The ones you endear to never last
Chemical burns and the animalistic
I'm just another harline psuedo-statistic

Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?

Blood on the paper and skin on my teeth
Trying to commit to what's beneath
To find the time is to lose the momentum
You learn the lessons and immediately forget them
Automatic and out of my reach
Consult all the waste to find the key
Minimal life and the polysyllabic
I'm just another blank page, push the button, pull the rage

Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?
I am all, but what am I?
Another number that isn't equal to any of you
I control, but I comply
Pick me apart, then pick up the pieces
I'm uneven
I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done
I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done
I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done
I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done

I am all, but what am I?
Another number that isn't equal to any of you
I control, but I comply
Pick me apart, then pick up the pieces
I'm uneven
(There's God) There's God
Can I feed you again?
Will I have to stay dumb?
You can feel and it begins
But I know inside this heart attack
I can see through your eyes
I'm terrified of everything
But it's no real surprise
Because the parasites are dancing closer
All this sacrilegious warns in posters
Can you handle it?

In the dark
Why I think I'm alone
I swept through my visions
I'm going too cold
Today is a tragedy
In the mouth of the mad
But that doesn't matter now
I've come relaxed
I'm curled up in a ball, and shaking
I'm hiding from the hell I'm making
I can't believe the chance I'm taking
Is there any other way?
Is there any other way?

The burden
The burden

(You can't save me)
There is nothing more to give
(I am changing)
Almost like I never lived
(Be me witness)
Just don't leave me in suspense
(Keep this, prove it)
Tell them all the consequences

The burden
(Have you ever been burdened before?)
The burden
(Was there anything you wanted more?)

(You can't save me)
There is nothing more to give
(I am changing)
Almost like I never lived
(Be my witness)
Just don't leave me in suspense
(Keep this, prove it)
Tell them all the consequences

Our same plea
By now you know that looks are deceiving
I'm covered in a rash and receding
Is there any other way?
Is there any other way?

For gods' sakes we've suffered
His pain is now our lives
For gods' sakes we've suffered enough

For gods' sakes we've suffered
His pain is now our lives
For gods' sakes we've suffered enough

For gods' sakes we've suffered
His pain is now our lives
For gods' sakes we've suffered enough

His pain is now our lives
For gods' sakes we've suffered enough

Enough
Enough

Be grateful now be honest now be precious now
Be mine just love me

Possession, feed my only vice
Confession, I won't tell you twice
Decide, either die for me
Or give up, any chance you had of being free

(don't go) I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved
Was hurting you
(don't go) I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved
Was hate

Stay inside the hole, let me take control
Dominate
You are nothing more, you are something less
Innocent
Something has to give, something has to break
Omnipresent
Fingers in your skin, let me savage in
You deserve it

(don't go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hurting you
(don't go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hate

You're mine (I know who you are)
Fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I'm on a burn, so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind 'cause you're never gonna give in
If acquired and that's how you like it
The same trouble in a different disguise
Bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me

Svengali, wail with the enemies
I never follow and I never make apologies
Your divisions, are gonna get ya
Because you won't disappoint each other
Center for the cynical, you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
Until we learn from our time we can never die

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

I hope you live
To see the day
When your world comes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame, yeah
Fuck

The Prescient, the Nascent
The quotient (They all will fall)
The Cystic, symbolic, condition (Systemic)
Egregious, replete with
These lesions (Contaminate)
Succumb to the selfish
Creation (Your failure)

Know I got ability, divisibility
I point a finger but it's always looking back at me
The centerpiece pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing skies of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe, doesn't matter now
Turn away, the killer is that of now

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me

I hope you live
To see the day
When your world comes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
Too tragic to stay with you
Too static to try for you
These scars, they swallow hard
The part of the past that's hollow and dark
Too horrid to kill for you
Too sordid to die with you
Unstable as always, come down
Everything else is just dust and sound

Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
See the shape (broken and thrown away)

I'd give it all away, come take it all away
You can't resent the fear
Somebody tell me how I got here
I'd give it all to you, come take it, it's all for you
The noise is so damn loud, but
Everything else is just dust and sound

Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
See the shape (broken and thrown away)

I don't want to do this anymore
Everything's shit, everything's been taken
Forsaken, gotta start it over 'cause I'm hearing it
Backwards, don't make sense, don't feel better
Who's better? It's not that simple
You gotta figure it out before you make things difficult
It's not a word, it's a problem, the problem was easy
Draw your conclusions, solutions?
Anybody else want to run?
Contorting, distorting, I am undone
One less propaganda nightmare fixture
Are you getting the picture?

Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
See the shape (broken and thrown away)

Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)

See the shape (broken and thrown away)
Broken and thrown away
(Yeah)
I can see you but you can't see me
I could touch you and you wouldn't even feel me
Wait a second and you'll settle down
I'm just waiting, 'til you really let your guard down
You're relaxed, you're sublime, you're amazing
You don't even know the danger you're facing
If I'm quiet, I'll slide up behind you
And if you hear me I'll enjoy trying to find you
I've been with you all day
I'm trying to stay calm
I'm impatient and it's really hard to breathe
I'm going to empty you and fill you in with me
Just keep the violence down
Not yet, don't make a sound
Oh god I'm feeling it
It's reaching fever pitch
My skin is caving in
My heart is driving out
No mercy, no remorse
Let nature take it's course
Watching, bring me to my knees
Waiting, I am your disease
Lover, set my symptom free
Covered, you won't feel a thing
You can't feel a thing
(Shh, wait, shh, no, wait, wait, no, shh, wait, wait, not yet, no, wait, wait)
I'm sweating through my veins
I'm trying to hold on
It's unbearable, it's almost worse for me
I'm gonna tear you apart and make you see
Make you see!
Watching, bring me to my knees
Waiting, I am your disease
Lover, set my symptom free
Covered, you won't feel a thing
This is the virus
The virus of life
This is inside us
The crisis, the knife
This is the virus
The virus of life
This is inside us
The crisis, the knife
It's almost time to play
It's time to be afraid
I can't control the pain
I can't control in vain
Oh god I'm ready now
You're almost ready now
I'm gonna love you now
I'm gonna break put you down
I see you in the dark
I see you all the way
I see you in the light
I see you plain as day
I wanna touch your face
I wanna touch your soul
I wanna wear your face
I wanna burn your soul
Watching, bring me to my knees
Waiting, I am your disease
Lover, set my symptom free
Covered, you can't love me
This is the virus, the virus of life
This is the virus, the virus of life
This is the virus, the virus of life

This is the virus, the virus of life!

Mother nature is a coward (mother nature is a whore)
No more presence, no more power (I pray for death, by the hour)
Cut another smile into me (into me is all you are)
My artifice won't recognize me (you won't find me) anymore

Post-traumatic war machines, the pessimists still won't believe
Throw away my past mistakes, it's all I can to feel
Let my weapons be your children, let my armies be your damned
Try to suffer on in silence, try to stop me if you can

Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, one day, we'll live our lives again

My ghosts have found their way back home
I have every right to kill my own
I am something now that never could exist
My anguish conquers all, pay the price and watch me fall
My only key is broken, my broken key is only? Me

Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, one day, we'll live our lives again

You utter waste of tired flesh,
It doesn't matter if you can't progress
Even now they still create me, give me your ignorance, irritate me
I am made of the same debris, you want it all but you didn't want me
Hypocrite with no real use, I'm alive, what's your excuse?

Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, one day, we'll live our lives again
Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, one day, we'll live our lives again

We'll live our lives again
Chaos, is just the beginning
Every promise I made I'm ascending
Stab the knives in the middle of the monster
I'm getting tired of drowning in concern

Crying for help
Isn't paid in full
The only reason that you love me is
I'm hated by all

Come on!
Come see destruction
I guess we're gonna leave it
Open for discussion

Who am I?
Where am I going?

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction
Maybe I'm looking for any direction

This is not my world
This is not my fate
This is something more
This is not my life
This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my expectation
This is not my desperation

(yeah!)

Rolled up thoughts and dig for the hell of it
Look at me, I am the glorified mahlcotect
Save me, save this
All I got to do is give up
And I always fuck giving up
Sic!

I've been the plot of a cosmic joke
And I don't get the punchline
A million people lined up for miles
To see the great big nil

Shut up and apologize!

This is not my world
This is not my fate
This is something more
This is not my life

This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my only reason to question why

Yes!
I know my uses
I have my pride
But my heart is still untamed
I learned my lessons
I've conquered death
I go on and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes
They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices
They tell me to believe

Another fucking accident out of control
All the attitudes will never change
My imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange

In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The agony of coming home has gone away
It's everywhere
It's everyone
It's every day

Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life

I beg your pardon
I'm out of the way
A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over, I smell the decay
Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same

In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy, I'm feeling fine
The agony of cynicism beckons me
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's everything

Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life

She seems dressed in all the rings
Of past fatalaties
So fragile yet so devious
She continues to see it
Climatic hands that press
Her temples and my chest
Enter the night that she came home
Forever
Oh (she's the only one that makes me sad)
She is everything and more
The solemn hypnotic
My dahlia, bathed in possession
She is home to me
I get neverous, perversed when I see her it's worse
But the stress is astounding
It's now or never she's coming home
Forever
Oh (she's the only one that makes me sad)(she's coming alive, she's coming alive)
Hard to say what caught my attention
Vixen crazy, aphid attraction
Carve my name in my face, to recognize
Such a pheromone cult to terrorize
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
(Yeah)
I'm a slave, and I am a master
No restraints and, unchecked collectors
I exist through my need, to self-oblige
She is something in me, that I despise
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wonder out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wonder out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye!

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes
How the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wonder over where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this
Why I didn't I see this?
I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate
I have sinned by just
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander over where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wonder out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye!

You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

I am a product, of your context
The uncontrollable urges that made me a menace
I'm all your problem, do you even care?
Pretend it's all a lie, that's how we made it here

Can't abate the truth with your secrets,
But you were far too impressed with your pretense
Now as far as I know, I don't know anything
'Cause you made damn sure, I wasn't anything

Distractions, Reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me

Crawl away from human clay
We our the broken shards beyond disarray
Before you cut them, you rape them
(Feed us by going on!)
Gonna go from my souls to my throat
You shouldn't wall us up with your apathy
But you did and now you're only growing enemies
This is the catalyst, the alpha, the first breed
'Cause you made damn sure, now we're everything

Distractions, Reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me

Maximize our prize of a record
It's all on the path and the words are of murder
This time I won't give in
I will save you from my sins

(What is wrong with this
Manipulation
Violence and Chaotic)

Destroy my taste and all that's right
I slam you shut, I can only take so much
How many times do I have to mistreat you?
'Cause you leap out of my hand as I feed you
Maybe now you'll understand severity
I sum it up with offense no matter poverty

Welcome to the transformation
Welcome to annihilation
Welcome to the man that wanted
Everything, but couldn't have it

Distractions, Reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me

Maximize our prize of a record

Save you from my sins
Save you from my sins
Thou shalt not
Kill your fathers, destroy another life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live forever, design a better death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear
Create a myth and separate the chosen ones
Adolescent independence, dominion
I only wanna believe in fuckin' anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything

The ending's the same, the world will not change
The answer is clear

Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
Blame yourselves because your children are mine
We are orphans, but we are not forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass till we die
We only wanna believe in fuckin' everything
But we're alive and we're not accepting anything

The ending's the same, the world will not change
The answer is clear? annihilation

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger then I was
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger better more

We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves

I will never become another piece
Inside the paralytic construct I hate
Live forever? well, I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fuckin' anything
But my solace is I can handle everything

The ending's the same, the world will not change
The answer is clear, obliteration

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger then I
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger better

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger then I
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had

We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
This song is not for the living
This song is for the dead

With my face against the floor
I can't see who knocked me out of the way
I don't want to get back up
But I have to, so it might as well be today
Nothing appeals to me, no one feels like me
I'm too busy being calm to disappear
I'm in no shape to be alone
Contrary to the shit that you might hear

So walk with me, walk with me
Don't let this symbolism kill your heart
Walk with me, walk with me
Just like we should have done right from the start
Walk with me, walk with me
Don't let this fucking world tear you apart
Our friends are all hurting from moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
Still we keep hoping, to fix all the defects and strengthen these seminal times
We go on together for better or worse, our history is to real to hate
Now and forever we stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fate
'Til we die
'Til we die
The start of a journey is every bit worth it, I cant let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid and the consciences opens the door
I never stopped trying, I never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent compliments each and everyone
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
'Til we die
'Til we die
My last true confession will open your eyes
I've never known trust like the night
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on

You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you

Sic, sic, sic, sic
It appears that we have reached the edge
That zenith where stimuli and comatose collide
Forty years ago the man proclaimed
The age of the gross to be upon us
And even though the man was destroying our heritage
And insulting our intelligence
That era has become very real
We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure
My generation will go down as the architects
Of contemporary disgust
Some have fought and died
Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price
They themselves don't care about and will never understand
I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face
Of a kind of man that is not mankind
Distrust in information
Fundamentalism of opinion
Catastrophic boredom and a fanatical devotion
To that which does not matter
Where is your glory now, people?
Where are your Gods and politicians?
Where is your shame and salvation?
You rage for no reason because you have no reason
What have you ever fought for?
What have you ever bled for?
The face of the earth is scarred with the walking dead
The age of the gross is a living virus
This is the future you have created
This is the world you have set ablaze
All your lies are coming true
All freedom is lost, all hope is gone
The whole thing, I think is sick
The state of the nation, violation!
A broken promise is as good as a lie
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
And we will burn because we won't unite!
We won't witness anymore freedom.
Where is anybody? do we need 'em?
I would rather fight,
Than let another die.
We're the problem,
But we're also the solution
All hope is gone!
If you want you cannot take it from me
If you think you can, you still don't know me
Let me tell you, when I said it, I meant it
And I will always have the right to defend it
Fifty seconds, a hundred murders
The bill of rights is a bill of sale.
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your systems fail!?
We have made the present obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!
We've seen the fall of the elite.
Bury your life,
Take your disease.
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone!
We have made the present obsolete
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life
Take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone
The wretched are the wounded
The hungry starved to death
At a place where no-one goes
The air itself is a final breathe
So discontinue
The antiseptic cash charade
As the cry of justice comes
Our malignant fire fades
I am the reason your future suffers
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure distinction
I am the remedy, spit in my face
All your lies and wars are out-dated
All your subjects are dulling mind games
I can rattle off a million other reasons why
But doesn't matter when the only thing we love will die
We have made the present obsolete
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life,
Take your disease
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone
We have made the present obsolete
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life,
Take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone
I can't get out or I'll die
Just let me be
I'll never be never

Be prepared for Hell and I say oh well
Just tell me when I can open my eyes and realize I've died

Be prepared for Hell
Go!
Stapled shut, inside an outside world and I'm
Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm
Catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page, and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me upon all your sordid little insurrections,
I've got no time to lose, and I'm just caught up in all the cattle
Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
And listen!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I'm ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt and I'm
I wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up all the battles
Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
And listen!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
My end
It justifies my means
All I have to do is delay
I'm given time to evade
The end of the road is my end
It justifies my means
All I have to do is delay
I'm haven't time to evade
The end of the road!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh!
Contrite, commercial, arrogance, leprosy
Consume the bitch, the fucker, mindless, like a child
For pity's sake, I've had all that I can take
We try, but in the end we'll see
There are no more codes
Only who is shit and who's still free
I was gonna change the world with honor and aggression
No one listened no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?

I don't want you anymore (I don't want you anymore)
I don't need you anymore (I don't need you anymore)
Fingerprint of God, your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever, you'll never have to say surrender
Because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I can't follow

Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?

You'll never censor me, you'd better cherish me
My reason has a voice, freedom's gone but we'll always have a choice
My present future tense, it doesn't make much sense
I'm coming after you, fuck you all I'm the only point of view

Violence and dollar signs, another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in diamonds and give away the only
Cost, you can't delay the inevitable
Lost, don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground, but I won't care when I go down

Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
Go ahead and disagree, I'm giving up again?
I'm giving up again?
My only consolation is all lies
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter has returned and it always looks like rain
I can't remember anything, anything
Inside the absolution is to come
And appetites are bittersweet I think I'm coming home
A chance to give up Avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time has gone, he hasn't come back
He hasn't come back yet
Before I tell my story please consider who I am
I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away
A skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame
And I cut my need into my heart, I tear it all apart
I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero
Just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today
I burn away
I burn away
I burn away
I burn away
My isolation is my course
The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
Until this war is over I won't ever lose my rage
And I cut my need into my soul, I guess I'll never know
I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero
Just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today
Burn me away, I wont become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all today
Give me the dust of my father
Stand on the face of the ancients
Bare the secret flesh of time itself

Follow me (follow me)
I've come so far behind again
Follow me (follow me)
Wish so hard I'm there again
Follow me (follow me)
Follow me (follow me)

All that I wanted the dreams I had before
All that I needed I've never needed more
All of my questions are answers to my sins
All of my endings waiting to begin

I know the way that I faulter
Can't be afraid of my patience
There's a sacred place where Razel keeps safe

Follow me (follow me)
I've seen so much I'm behind again
Follow me (follow me)
I feel so bad I'm in love again
Follow me (follow me)

All that I wanted the dreams I had before
All that I needed I've never needed more
All of my questions are answers to my sins
All of my endings waiting to begin
I know you don't want to see. I know you're not part of me
But you wonder just the same. So I'll let you in on this game
What's on the top is just the beginning 
Of the protectorate that keeps Gaia spinning
It never ends, and with the gifts Luna sends, to the apocalypse
On we defend for the right to live in a perfect world
For our past mistakes, extinction we are hurled
Trying to make amends for the Impergium, 
As Weaver and the Wyld and a bitch called the Wyrm
(You don't want to know)
All the power of the Wyld that runs through me, 
Yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me
(You don't want to see)
Our viewpoint on what mankind is doing, 
That black inside when frenzy is brewing
(You don't want to feel)
The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing 
Just where my hopes and dreams are going
(I won't let you be)
Caught up in a war that you are not part of. 
I sign this letter Your Father, With Love.
I'm trying to set my mind free. 
I'm sorry you never knew me.
My soul is in recession. 
Painful to make this confession.
We too feel alone
That place in my mind 
Is that space that you call mine 
That place in my mind 
Is that space that you call mine 
Therever been all the time 
Lost enslaved fatal decline 
I've been waiting for this too fool (Good) 
The pieces are only as good as the whole 
Severed with self from my all a lie 
Cut out the only thing that was right 
What If I never saw you again 
I'd die right next to you in the end 
That place in my mind 
Is that space that you call mine 
That place in my mind 
Is that space that you call mine 
I wouldn't let you walk away 
Without hearing what I have to say 
Without hearing what I have to say 
Without hearing what I have to say
Sitting in the dark, I can't forget
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get
Another story of the bitter pills of fate
I can't go back again
I can't go back again
But you asked me to love you and I did
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
And when I got away, I only got so far
The other me is dead
I hear his voice inside my head
We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
You told me to love you, and I did
Tied my soul into a knot
And got me to submit
So when I got away,
I only kept my scars
The other me is gone
Now I don't know where I belong
We were never alive,
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead visions in your name
Dead fingers in my veins
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
I don't like a fuckin' thing! music sucks dick 
Suck the snot end of the tip of my prick 
You fucking cunts, get off of my back 
I don't wanna do a show with your shitty 
Fuckin' band, you suck, they suck, guess what, get fucked 
I can't think of any other words to say but fuck 
Don't drag our opinions, our opinions are great 
It's new school face motherfuckers I hate 
Local bands (suck these nuts) 
U.S. bands (suck these nuts) 
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts) 
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts! 
Go! 
Don't berate me, cuz you can't stop me 
From breakin' your face, it's you I'll erase 
It's hate, motherfucker, hate, motherfucker, hate 
Local bands (suck these nuts) 
U.s. bands (suck these nuts) 
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts) 
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts! 
Go! 
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great? 
Get this or die! 
Local bands (suck these nuts) 
U.s. bands (suck these nuts) 
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts) 
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts! 
Go!
I'm cold, I'm ugly
I'm always confused by everything
I can stare into a thousand eyes
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie

It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes
My heroes are dead, they died in my head
Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain
Something inside me has opened up again

Thoughts of me exemplified
All the little flaws I have denied
Forget today, forget whatever happened
Everyday I see a little more of overall deficiencies
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe

What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?

I save all the bullets from ignorant minds
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens
I decrease, while my symptoms increase

God what the fuck is wrong
You act like you knew it all along
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing

All I ever wanted out of you was
Something you could never be
Now take a real good look at
What you've fucking done to me

What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?

Gimme any reason why I'd need you, boy
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up
Gimme any reason why I'd need you, bitch
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up

I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me

I keep my scars from prying eyes
Incapable of ever knowing why
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer
Why am I so fascinated by
Bigger pictures, better things
But I don't care what you think
You'll never understand me

What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
Fuck!
I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound 
I wanna push my face in and feel the swoon 
I wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me 
Cause the line gets crossed when you don't come clean 
My wormwood meets your pesticide 
You'll never get out, cause you were never alive 
I am infinite, I am the infant finite 
Come a little closer and I'll show you why
(No one is safe)
Noises, noises, people make noises 
People make noises when they're sick 
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing
How does it feel to be locked inside another dream 
That never had a chance of being realized? 
What the fuck are you lookin' at? 
I'll tell you what you're lookin' at 
Everyone you ever fuckin' laughed at 
Look in my eyes for the answers, typical 
I can feel it underneath like a miracle 
Everybody in the world needs more than 
Lies and consequences to poser them 
Once again, it's me and no one else 
I can't remember if there was a someone else 
It's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands 
And it's shaking, you'll never take me 
(No one is safe)
Noises, noises, people make noises 
People make noises when they're sick 
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing
Nothing! 
(Hate) Hate ain't enough to describe me 
(Scream) Somewhere between screaming and crying 
I'm not supposed to be here 
I'm not supposed to be 
(Why) When do I get to know why? 
(Bitter) Bitter as the stink of when I try 
I'm not supposed to be here 
I'm not supposed to be 
Pull your hands away 
I'm gone, goodbye, it's so depressing 
Withering away 
Take a look, inside, my soul is missing 
All I have is dead, so I'll take you with me 
Feel like I'm erased, so kill me just in case 
(Covet) Everything around mes mine 
(Sty) Can't see through the sties in my eyes 
I'm not supposed to be here 
I'm not supposed to be 
(Down) Scratching and clawing all the way 
(Stay) You won't let me fucking stay 
I'm not supposed to be here 
I'm not supposed to be 
(Live) Is there another way to live? 
(Die) Cause it's the only way to die 
I'm not supposed to be here 
I'm not supposed to be
Somebody give me some light
Not pointed into the dark
Somebody show me the end
Not trying to push a start
Not trying to figure out
A better way, a better answer
But I keep finding all the problems
I've been looking after
Don't get wound up in the world
With nothing but a smile
I'll take a ton of words
And use them to instill denile
Don't get close
You don't know me
And you'll never know
Shivelry, will get you somewhere
Rivalry, will take you there
Don't get close
You don't know me
And you'll never know
Shivery, will get you somewhere
Rivalry, will take you there
Maybe I should look away
Before I really miss
Maybe I should pick the time
Before I pick the place
I bet you all the things
That you emulate, you penalize
But I don't want to go
Before you learn to finalize
Don't get close
You don't know me
And you'll never know
Shivelry, will get you somewhere
Rivalry, will take you there
Don't get close
You don't know me
And you'll never know
Shivery, will get you somewhere
Rivalry
You assitane the plot
My vision's overshot
I have the best confection
I was gone for all the lessons
Who coined these words I use
Stay out and be abused
I didn't want to be
The undeniable source of everything
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Need change, watching all the conflicts
Constrict, push the fist in, squeeze it
I can not resist, claws and fist
Remember, remember
You take the rivalries
And never made much sense
I have the worst possession
What I want is so insensitive
Stay out and be abused
Cause this is so confused
I only want to be
Left over, now run away
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited last, my time's elapsed
Now, all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it

Pull me back together
Or separate the skin from the bone
Leave me all the pieces, and then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than dream
But I found out the hard way,
Nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
Meet the man that made me
Greet the can that I came from
Oh the fucking sacred heart of Jesus
Blew it in the back room
Feelin' like a real goon
Slam the fuck aside, man
I'm on, you're not

I am the great big mouth
Good riddance, though I'm sad to say
I didn't get to kill you
Rhetoric, better look both ways
I gotta get an arm through
Stain
What the fuck is up? get the fuck away
Run if you want to
Innocent? you're a guilty conscience
Laugh last, break through
Stain

I don't give a fuck, bitch
I don't understand, bitch
You don't matter
I don't give a shit, man
I don't give a fuck, man
I don't really care, man
I'm the super sized man
You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

Shallow skin, I can paint with pain
I mark the trails on my arms with your disdain
Everyday it's the same I love, you hate
But I guess I don't care any more
Fix my problems with the blade
While my eyes turn from blue to gray
God, the worst thing happened to me today
But I guess I don't care anymore

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault

This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

My flaws are the only thing left that's pure
Can't really live, can't really endure
Everything I see reminds me of her
God I wish I didn't care anymore
The more I touch, the less I feel
I'm lying to myself that it's not real
Why is everybody making such a big fucking deal?
Is never gonna cure anymore

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

What the hell am I doing?
Is there anyone left in my life?
What the fuck was I thinking?
Anybody want to tell me I'm fine?
Where the hell am I going?
Do I even need a reason to hide?
I am only betrayed
I am only conditioned to die

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated

Some have fought and died
Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves don't care about and will never understand
I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is not mankind
Distrust in information
Fundamentalism of opinion
Catastrophic boredom, and a fanatical devotion to that which does not matter.
Where is your glory now, people?
Where are your gods and politicians?
Where is your shame and salvation?
You rage for no reason because you have no reason
What have you ever fought for?
What have you ever bled for?
The face of the earth is scarred with the walking dead
The age of the gross is a living virus
This is the future you have created
This is the world you have set ablaze
All your lies are coming true
All freedom is lost
All hope is gone
Insane am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill
Everything and everyone
Say you'll do it but never will

Do you believe? do you fade like a dream?
Let me hear you breathe
Let me watch as you sleep
The sparrow's eyes, promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

The blood and the body control the cut so it's seamless
Show me your heart show me the way to complete this
Tethered to a scene I treasure can you help me?
I sever god it's perfect, it's never really perfect
Now, I can finally be myself

That was all I got and now you got me

All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in history and not down in flames
Meningitis,
I will survive this,
Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis
The time of the nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one

This is so typical,
Apocalyptical,
Hanging on abysmal release,
Jesus,
I don't need this,
Don't wanna be this,
Icon in the making,
My hands are fucking shaking

What if god doesn't care?
What if god doesn't care?

Remember,
Surrender,
The time is now
Continue,
We're in you,
And we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name
It doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field
It's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past
And fall apart like a cigarette ash

Down,

We will burn your cities down
We will burn your cities down

We will burn your cities down
Feed the hungry, feed them shit
Feed them bones and politics
You wanna revolutionize?
Be specific and believe your eyes
Start a war in another backyard
And we'll destroy your house of cards
Give me a minute and I'll change your mind
Give me a bullet and I'll change your life

Remember,
Surrender,

Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing mode of pleasure
A pleasure that will take my mind off the reality of life
My past life
Life as I know it know
And whatever may come it slowly disappears
To somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there until I wish to retrieve it

Yes I will stay here for awhile for I need the break
A break from the pressures of life
And everything that lay in the palm of life's hands, life's hands

This mode is incredible
It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it
But that's life

That's life, that's life, that's life

Come unglued
It's not easy
To see all of you
Help yourselves
Help is on the way
Well there's nothing to lose
So now, I have something to say
Maybe we can all recognize a moment of sadness
Maybe we can finally agree on a sane point of view
A long time ago we believed that we were united
So the last thing on Earth I am ready to do is say, goodbye
A long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us
This hasn't torn us apart, so nothing ever will
How can we know where we are if the sun is beyond us
But this moment will show us the rest of our lives
No one is going to save us this time
No one can know what we're feeling, in that I may trust

Everybody's so completely sure of what we are

The whole world is my enemy, and I'm a walking target
Two times the devil with all the significance

Stripped down, we want you dead

And I don't think I need this anymore

But I'm fat and I'm ugly and proud, so fuck you
Standing out is the new pretension
Sreamline the (sic)ness, half-assed aggression

Everybody dies, shuffle on, remove it
Individuals, indispensable

But this side is done, I don't need it
Before you go, you should know you're breaking down
You'll be rotten by the time you're underground

Still question the conquered
To hell with your intelligence
Just figure out your common sense

No one is bulletproof

And I'll eat the skins of my brothers
Yellow pastor bones will make a perfect wall
Gonna fill in the cracks of these feelings
With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all

Selfishness
Take granted for everything
What more could you ask for?
It doesn't matter anymore

No one is bulletproof

Can you feel the cold?
Fortune never favors the old
Tired of defending myself
Go complain to somebody else
Somebody else

The masses and your manners
Are the voices in your head
They're smashing out your windows
That you worked for beneath your bed
You live right fucking 'neath it
So you'll die like thanking gods
In between the voices and the pure
'Cause masses have the charm

Nine for sure

And I have only sand inside of me
It's a rotting sick that I don't need
To pene-vent your interro-gration
I can believe I'm saying this
I'll live with my regrets
I'll die by my decisions
I'm not your fucking superstar
Keep it closed, you're going way too far

No one is bulletproof

Kept me outta the way

Once, inside, all I hold is ash

Fail, suppressing every feeling
I'm in so much pain
I have every fuckin' right to hate you
I can't take it!

The hardest part was knowing that I could never be you
Now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you

My demise, I took a life worth living and
Made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me

Who are you to me? Who am I to you?
Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence?
By default, you are my only link to the outside
Psychosomatic suicide
Where were you when I was down?
Can you show me a way
To face everyday with this face, goodbye

My demise, I took a life worth living and
Made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me

When I blur my eyes, they make the whole
World breath, I see you fucking me
And I am absolutely controlly every urge
To mutilate, the one and only answer
So much for memories
I want to dress in your insecurities
And be the perfect you, I'm through
I'm out-stretched out for all to loathe
Here we go, the ultimate irony

My demise, I took a life worth living and
Made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
I'm always ready to die but you're killing me
Killing me, killing me, killing me
Killing me,
I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the
Everyday bullshit things that you have done

Your impossible ego fuck is like a
Megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
You fuckin' touch me I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that
Shit you call a heart
Ya ya ya

I don't mind being ogled, ridiculed
Made to feel minuscule
If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful
The only thing you really know about me is
That's all you'll ever know

I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

I'm turning it around like a knife in the shell
I want to understand why, but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lotta reasons to stop it
I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it
At least I admit it

I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you
I can't fuckin' take it anymore
A snap of the synapse
And now it's fuckin' war
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you

I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
My freedom is best
Whole country's on house arrest
And everyone's a suspect
You can't feel the flow because you died
Face down on a "suicide"
The muthafucker's on self destruct
Nobody guardin' your back  it's all a front

Save this! my rage is bliss!
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed!

Where's chuck d when ya need him?
You ain't shit  just a puddle on the
Bed spread
The maniac psycho
Cool j screamed the shit
But I still can't believe it
Man, it's funny that you scare me so
Just enough to fuck me up again and again
Hard life is hard as hell
Better back the fuck on up
'Cause this is

No kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out!)
It's no kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me!)

Can't be real no more
Your mask is skin and bone
Savor every flavor you want 'cause it's not your own
Bad-ass at bat, man
Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
Breathe! amer-cult, breathe! on more - seethe!
Freak like you gotta pair
Won't be my fault
When you're painted in the corner of a no-good life
This is

No kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out!)
It's no kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me!)

I can't remember, I don't understand,
Is it malice that makes you this way?
Carry it with you 'til someone forgives you
I laugh 'cause there's nothing to say
You can't begin to consider the
Palpable hate in the air when you're here
None of us wonder what weather you're under
You're making it perfectly clear!

Lights ain't on, shit ain't right
Never had peace so I had to fight
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against
The wall, slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me
You're all reality and sound bites
And the freedom is never in plain sight
The feelings, the question, the price is too
Human, for fucking sake, this is

No kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out!)
It's no kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me!)
Pain made to order

I'm not the second coming
I'm the first wave

Better get an army
'Cause the fire left me unscathed
You betcha bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around 'cause I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the achtung
Get back or get stung
Idiotic sense of yourself
Are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me
Totalitarian
The one and only muthafucka
Top of the world man

'Cause I can't stand it, planned it, gonna crash land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels, what you gonna do?

All I hear is human noise
You made your own fuckin' choice
I belong to only me
Silence for my revelry

I can only die over time
Filthy hands, stay away from mine
Every reason is a right to hate
Painful clutch, death is fine, gimme mine

Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away

Somebody explain this
You don't care 'cause you don't exist
What the fuck is this another joke?
Reckoning!

Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Watch those idiosyncrasies!
Watch all the idiots fall on me!
Running out of ways to get outta the way!
Take another shot just to stay the same!
But I need some balance back it off!
Fill your lungs till it makes you cough!
Tell me everything is gonna be alright,
'Cause I don't think ill make it through tonight!

The only way
Is all the way!
The only way
Is all the way!

O, my, god!
Its judgment day and I'm not prepared!
Everybody out there is runnin' scared!
So take a little bit off the top!
I don't care just make it stop!

I won't give another soul to you!
I won't give another life to you!

You have to stop!
Stop!
Do one thing and say something cryptic!
But the styles always clash!
One thing I know for sure,
The hypothetical won't work any more!
One wrong move and they will pound!
My nails are tight inside my wrist!
This sacrament,
Is sacrilege,
And sentimental!
Deity experimental!
Faith is accidental!

I won't give another soul to you!
I won't give another life to you!
I won't give another thought to you!
I won't give any more of my hope to you!
The ghosts have killed enough
Familiar haunts have had enough
Too much thought will give you doubt
And now they found you
It's safer in an encage
They can tell you what to say
All your dreams come with a price, so they own you
But what did you expect?
Was it too much to protect?
Did you understand they had selfish intentions?
And they were pulling you in opposite directions

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override oh oh
We are the override

The dead don't know, the dead are lonely
A fascination phase
When this mercy execution says it's over
You follow as preferred
Now their plans are un-detoured
Who can bring them in to sew the seed?
It's over
Even hate starts out as love
Sometimes when it's all you want
Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted
And all this hope is the emotion you abandoned

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override, yeah

You clawed out from nothing and I sent you back
Fought to the metal, and law's what you lacked
Covered in sores, you cannot be the one
You are the answer to why we have risen
You are not the way
You are judged to feel afraid
You are simple and unchanged
We believe you should give up
Give up
Give up
God and his mercy will take you for granted
When all that's left is a life you abandoned

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override oh oh

You live when I'm dead
One more time mother fucker!
Everybody hates me now so fuck it
Blood on my face and my hands and I don't know why

The reckoning, the sickening
Back at you, subversion
Pseudo-sacred with psycho virgin

Go dig your graves

Oh, there are cracks, in the road we lay
From where the devil fell
The secrets have gone mad!
This is nothing new,
But would we kill it all?
Fate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes
And say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness,
But a message to bring
I think we're done

Pre-flight demonstration
Led to desperate voices fueled by flames
Now I'm out here waitin'
Hoping you would send a sign
Came a million miles
And the earth grows small as I lovingly leave it behind
Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend
We seem to have found it
All the hope we've been denied
There's more than we've been told
Had to find it on the other side
Now I must be dreaming
Face against the frozen glass
But there's no return now
And the blazing worlds salute
As we go flying past
Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you my friend
Light years above
(Take me higher)
Time seems to wait
(Take me higher)
Promise to see you again
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the hill
Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved

It's building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me,
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
(Oh oh oh oh oh eh eh oh oh)
The mark I breathe on you. 
It's tearing through your soul. 
The breath I waste. 
Losing control. 
I bleed in pain. 
Testing what I know. 
Lips soaked in deceit. 
Pull me from here. 
No one's innocent. So why do I feel bad? 
But guilt keeps creeping, creeping up on me. 
Guilt. Tearing me up inside. 
The innocent. 
An evil in disguise. 
The face of beauty to fall for. 
I fall to my knees, deceitful. 
Brought down by feelings of regret. 
Again your mind has failed the test. 
Not everyone feels the same. 
Pacifist blinded by the game. 
Stand tall. They'll break your heart. 
Stand tall. They'll smash your ego. 
Stand tall. They'll tear you down. 
Stand tall. Scar your soul. 
Break your thought. 
Fuck your mind. 
The mark I breathe on you. 
It's burning through your soul. 
The breath I waste. 
Losing control. 
I bleed in pain. 
Testing what I know. 
Lips soaked in deceit. 
Pull me from this hole.
Centuries passed and still the same
War in our blood, some things never change
Fighting for land and personal gain
better your life, justify our pain
The end is knocking
The end is knocking

We've all been lost for most of this life
(lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
(most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride

How many lives will we take
How many hearts destined to break
Nowhere to run, can't escape
Full of ourselves, tied to our fate
The end is knocking
The end is knocking, yeah

We've all been lost for most of this life
(lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
(most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride

With peace of mind so hard to find
We're dwelling on the drastic signs
Another way to numb our mind
And as you close your eyes tonight
and pray for a better life
you'll see it flying helplessly away

We've all been lost for most of this life
(lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
(most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun will never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right
Lend me your courage to stand up and fight, on tonight
Stand up and fight

Now fighting rages on and on
To challenge me you must be strong
I'll walk your land but don't be long
Two million soldiers can't be wrong

Its no fun but I've been here before
I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war
(Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things)
Some are scared others killing for fun, I shot a mother in front of her son
(Change this from my consciousness and please erase my dreams)

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to god that our side is right
You know we won but still we lose, until I make it home to you
I see your mother filled with tears we grew up so fast where did those years go
Memories won't let you cry unless I don't return tonight

So many soldiers on the other side, I take their live so they don't take mine
(Scared to make it out alive now murders all I know)
Nobody tells me all the reasons were here, I am a weapon so there's nothing to fear
(Another day another life but nothing real to show for)

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to god that our side is right
You know we won but still we lose, until I make it home to you
I see your mother filled with tears we grew up so fast where did those years go
Memories won't let you cry unless I don't return tonight

Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun will never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight

Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive
Strangers blood on my hands, shot all I can
There were no silent nights watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me (no thought of me)
No thought of me

Walk the city lonely
Memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your street tonight
Forgive me for my crimes, don't forget that I was so young
Fought so scared in the name of God and country
One snap for the dying
One click to end the day
Another story with a mangled scene
It couldn't happen any other way
You wanna talk about it?
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time
Watch the clock 'til you unwind
You wanna cry about it
It's making me consider that I've lost my mind
The way I see, you must be blind
So this is the world you left behind
This is the guilt that consumes you
So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
Can't bribe me with money
Can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home
Until you come on me with manic fame
You wanna know about it?
Well I'ma be fucking with you every time
Story broken, you're behind
Yeah when you ask about it?
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find
So this is the hate I've been born to
Full are the tales of the untrue
So die alone
This is one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
And I'm waiting
Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
(And all the promises I'll find)
No hesitating, you've pulled the trigger now your story's left behind
I know you want to see me fry
Lock my soul you hope to burn
So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
To die unknown
Would crush the fish-lens we all see through
To clear the glare
Expose the ugliness we hold true
Nightmare!(now your nightmare comes to life)
Dragged ya down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
Peace of mind is less than never
Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
Burn the world your last endeavor
Flesh is burning
You can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have
Such easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while
They ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave
Until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness,
Turning, haunting, yearning
Pull the trigger
You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare
(While your nightmare comes to life)
Can't wake up in a sweat
'Cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons
Victim of your own creation
Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
Loathing self-assassination
You've been lied to
Just to rape you of your site
And now they have the nerve
To tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they
Medicate your brain
And while you slowly
Go insane they tell ya
"Given with the best intentions
Help you with your complications"
You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Oh, it's your fuckin' nightmare
Fight
Not to fail
Not to fall
Or you'll end up like the others
Die
Die again
Drenched in sin
With no respect for another
Down
Feel the fire (fire)
Feel the hate
Your pain is what we desire
Lost
Hit the wall (wall)
Watch you crawl (crawl)
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices (calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (these signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
(As your nightmare comes to life)
You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare
Gone cast away in time
Evil yours, now evil mine
So I robbed you blind, the voices
In my head could just a less than
Peaceful side
The endless possibilities
Controlling every fight
You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade
I've stood in the dark, been
Waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive, I'm not ready to die
Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
Make me crawl, to daddy's little
Girl to read the writings on the wall
While cast into the nothingness
The final curtain call
You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade.
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive, I'm not ready to die
Through the madness we find
Loyalty is no match for power
Save your body or lie, left to rot in
Your darkest hour
Friends won't help you now as long as your mine
You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade.
I've stood in the dark, been
Waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive
And I'll control the world one
Person at a time
As I damn the dead I'm trying to
Survive, I'm not ready to die
Oh!
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
You've been breakin down for far too long
Far too many moons since you felt well and strong
You see, you could say goodbye but you don't have to die
Not ever
Engineer the wires to your brain
Architect a code so you won't feel the pain
With your family by your side and vigor in your eyes forever
Live Forever
I'm way up, a god in size, beyond the reach of mortals
I shed my human side
Farther, O' Father
I stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?
Final paradigm
What's it really mean to be a man?
Think about your answer but please understand
While it's natural to fear, I'll make it disappear forever
I forever
I'm way up, a god in size, beyond the reach of mortals
I shed my human side
Farther, O' Father
I stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?
Final paradigm
Singular I am
I have the question if these thoughts are mine
To live forever but did something in me die?
I'm clawing my skin but I can't feel it inside
I know the agony of pain would hurt so much better
I'm way up so far up
Have I lost myself tonight?
Father, O' Father
Have you lost that boy you used to know?
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me, occupy my brain oh yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
Two nights ago I was shot
A bullet sunk straight through the skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awoke, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb
No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through
You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my mother shed tears
No!
This gun has stopped time in its tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace
I'll watch you call, calling for me,
You can't bring back time
Close your eyes and look away,
Fate exposed, won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
Descending entity in me
My voice has been taken from me
The more I listen, the more I have to say
You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my mother shed tears
And taste the blood that she cries,
And taste the blood that she cries
I'll watch you call, calling for me,
You can't bring back time
Close your eyes and look away,
Fate exposed, won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
Descending entity in me
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Prodigia, comploratus
Silens, oro
Regnet exitium
Days of warning
Night brings morning
My prayers worthless
Heaven is burning down
I walk stricken
Pitch black vision
Oh one, save me
Caress my weary eyes
Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames
In flames
In flames
In flames
Nature quaking
Prophets aching
I kneel faithful
Damnation cracks the sky
My heart fiction
Superstition
Your grace deathless
Give life to my last breath
Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the Earth in flames
In flames
In flames
In flames
Prodigia, comploratus
Silens, oro
Regnet, exitium
Rise from ashes
Violence clashes my soul vacant
Cleanse me of all this sin
I stand guilty
I bleed filthy
Born of fire
Savor this final hour
Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the Earth in flames
In flames
In flames
In flames
As the embers rose through the Roman sky
Tell me were you calm when they took your life?
Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
Shared with us the world well before your time
Though they took your voice words forever shine
Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
As they spoke your fate a fearless man replied
"As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"
Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
They all know
They all know
Sorry did I wake your dreams?
Some questions are up to be
We only only wake up when we sleep
Left by the lunar light
Troubles are all we find
Lost our way tonight
Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?
Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I could use some guiding light
Some place to go
If you hear me let me know
They all know
They all know
Ever since the day you left
My fate's been set alone
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight
So why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?
Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?
Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light
Some place to go
If you hear me let me know
If you hear me let me know
Aaaah
Help me find my way
I said help me find my way
No force inside of me
Stone cold lips and help me see
All lies into a degree
Losing you I wanna be
You'll find out I do
He maybe out of his mind
But some day you will find
That sanity's left us all blind
And dragged us all behind
Of moment's seemed to go's eyes
Crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die
I say it just moves on
If you'd only open your mind
Then someday you will find
Insanity's left us behind
And walked right through the night
I can see the picture's clear
As yesterday pictures of my own
I can hear the voice's begging you to stay
But know you're not alone
Save me,
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light
Some place to go
If you hear me let me know
If you hear me let me know
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die
Tonight we all die young
Caught up in this madness too blind to see
Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I'll taste your blood tonight
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
But now it's too late you've wasted all your time
Relax while you're closing your eyes to me
So warm as I'm setting you free
With your arms by your side there's no struggling
Pleasure's all mine this time
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
But now it's too late you've wasted all your time
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure, unmask your desire
Perishing
We've all had a time where we've lost control
We've all had our time to grow
I'm hoping I'm wrong but I know I'm right
I'll hunt again one night
You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me baby
But now it's too late you've wasted all your time
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure, unmask your desire
Perishing
Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built don't point the blame on me
Scream, scream, scream the way you would
If I ravaged your body
Scream, scream, scream the way you would
If I ravaged your mind
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure, unmask your desire
Perishing
We keep writing, talking and planning, but everything's changing
We all know what to do but know one does it
Now this time has passed and full of regret
Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone
When they get back, it won't be the same
My life, you've always been there
Now you're gone and my heads spinning
Left the childhood, left the memories, left the good times in the past
Moving on your time has run out
Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

Never will I forget you, and all the memories past
So rarely I get to see your face
Growing I looked to you in guidance
We knew that time would kill us, but you're still so close to me

To me you were my life
To me you were my soul companion
Now you are so far away
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had
Come back, to the days when we were young
Come back, to the days when nothing mattered
To the days when nothing mattered

And I feel that time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
These streets we travel on
Will undergo our same lost past
I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile
Holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come
But I don't want to leave you
I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Newborn life replacing all of us
Changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?
I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
So, what if I never hold you, yeah
Or kiss your lips again?
Woah, so I never want to leave you
And the memories of us to see I beg don't leave me
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day [then continues in the background]
I stand here alone
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
I stand here alone
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
Lets take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See I pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of feeling of being damned alone
I got a storybook of my own
Don't you see I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire
Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell ya who not to be
Now you know I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire
Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Pardon your mind through the chains of the divine
Make way, the shepherd of fire
Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me it's never too late
I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
'Cause I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
I am your wrath
I am your guilt
I am your lust
And you know it's right
I am your love
I am your stall
I am your trust
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire
I slide through the wasteland that's my world
My hunger takes your life, preyed on to keep me alive, yeah
Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty in me
Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
That's right I shed my skin tonight but my fangs are hard to hide
And you know that you're going to die, yeah
Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty to me
Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite

I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control
That burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside
Making my way through the night you're still in my sight
You're runnin' away cause ya' know you can't hide
My instincts are cold blooded hate; to you I'm the bearer of fate
Wrong place and now the wrong time, now terror is all that you'll find
Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control
That burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside
Stay inside tonight, you're out there all alone
Vanish from my sites, venomous control
You can't make it right, my appetite has grown
Lost your final fight, no love will be shown
Stay inside tonight, you're out there all alone
Vanish from my sites, venomous control
You can't make it right, my appetite has grown
Lost your final fight, no love will be shown
It seems I should have walked away
Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight, in sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I wore the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises but who dares to pull the strings
I know this may be hard for you to believe in all
But you only exist because we allow it
I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?
By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem a stunningly short time
You've been beaten down time and time again
But still you find yourself at the center of it all
I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?
You hear me, you had one thing to do, one thing
And you fucked it up, piece of shit
Nurse, patient 666158 needs to be sedated
We need 500 CCs of M
Oh hello there, dearie
I've been expecting you
Posturing the way I feel
Is truth only what we believe is real?
Marvel the sketches that paint the night, starlight
And take a breath before it's all erased away
Never feared for anything, never chained but never free
I tried to heal the broken love with all I could
Lived a life so endlessly saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal the broken love with all I could
Will you stay
Will you stay away forever
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book its burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away
Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind
Where you can stay you can stay awake forever
How do I live without the ones I love
Time still turns the pages of the book its burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away
Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me 'cause as soon as I'm done
I'll be on my way to live eternally
How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book its burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it's so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you're so far away
I love you, you were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you when He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands are tied
So far away and I need you to know
So far away and I need you to need you to know
My story starts the day they said "she can't be found"
the news so dark, heart stopped, I stood silent without a sound
It's over, she's finished, mother lies with my father and sister too
Cold-blooded, they suffered, shot down by the outlaws after you
Sorrow swallows my screams
Strength of the world, is on my shoulders
Strength of the world, is on my side
Strength of the world, the one true beholder
Ice in my veins, for those who've died
I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say
Avenge the dead kill all who cross me in my path
Suicidal, I never planned on coming back
I want it, I need it, revenge is dripping from my teeth
Need nothin', to feel power, and bring the killers to their knees
Nothin' ta lose vengeance ta gain (you know I'll never be the same)
So taste my breath I'm close behind you (so desperate on your final day)
Sorrow swallows my screams
Sitting in silence with heaven above me I prayed every night by their graves
While I search for closure I feel it no longer
I can't turn my cheek away
I stand before you; I'll sin when I have to
But now I leave your side, to avenge my family's pride
So far forever alone, a greater punishment on me has been imposed
A killer falling from the light, I'll miss my family, I'll never be alright
We've been through hell. Sewn up our eyes
Found fuel in meds. Viewed through the narrow
Encouraged fear when so inclined
Bought peace through wars that doomed our children to die
Ego is sure to fix the world
Served up to happy boys and girls
I'd make a decision if granted the privilege
But I'm afraid my taste is unrefined
And no one likes cheap wine
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
You own the burg. We sleep in streets
You dine then waste. We forage to eat
Well who pays the tab when you cross the line?
Who writes the check? Who's herding the swine?
Just takes a fence to rule the roost
As long as the scale has been reduced
How can we see the outside of the pen when survival has possession of our minds?
Calmly walk the line
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous find in an illusion
(Vlader Lauder sat in sorrow
For all his teeth had gone
He drank sweet rum
While fingering his gun
And eyeballed a feast
Not one bite he could eat
Somebody cut off his head!)
Dear radiation my sweet friend
Let agents dance upon my nerves
Let sunlight glow under my skin
Let toxins seep into my soul
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous time I will find in an illusion
It's an illusion
I wake up every morning, bright and early
Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone
Tension is pulling me in all directions
And I'll be done once you use me as a rope
Sometimes the pressure will just drive you crazy
At any time I could explode
I need some piece of mind, it's got me tired
Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road

I need a moment cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Works hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

I sit in traffic every single morning
Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind
Making the money so I feed my family
But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time
I got no free days on my busy schedule
I turn the page and it's the same
Don't like my situation, you don't either
Don't wanna look back scared, I will get away

I need a moment cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Works hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

But every now and then
I drive alone
And over all
Hot summer days
A gentle breeze that feels alright
Home alone
And I can't feel the pain
Only strain
Enjoy the sights
I feel alive
When actually here just feels alright
Far from home

I need a moment cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Works hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time
Man's coming more corrupt now, godless, wicked, and cruel
The soulless man stood silenced, Mary's "word" rang so true
Chastisement worse than the flood, spread the word, its all through
Don't kill the messenger girl
As if we haven't swam enough tin this life of misery
Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Fell sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears
A stab in the dark and it wounded our will
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time
We've grown into numbers six hundred sixty six
War breaks, a sign of the end, eternally expelled
Look to the sky for knowledge, the stars align tonight
Eclipse and heaven shall fall
Now I know I've seen it all in my life of misery
Dust the apple off, savor each bite
And deep inside you know Adam was right
Lust and power, indulgence, no fear
Left with is sins, how does this end?
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time
As the prophets shed the light on what's to come the crowds did gather
Your time is precious, they explained, no time to worry, messiah's coming
Don't go to sleep tonight, darling, hold me in your arms
These will be our final days and I can't let go
Walls are falling, churches burning, women ravaged, children crying
Flesh is tearing, some still fighting
In this world of misery
Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Fell sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears
A stab in the dark and it wounded our will
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time
[Chorus]
I don't want to know. And I don't want to see you in this place. 
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face. 
And I don't want to hear anymore. 
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor.
 
Get the fuck out of here now. 
Come on you kids, stand your ground. 
This is your show, it's your family. 
All of my friends there for me. 
There's four-hundred more of us then them. 
So kick them out. 
Keep it positive. 
Keep it real. Keep it true. 
Together with my friends. 
I'll be there for you. 
Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through. 
This is to my brothers, I ll be there for you. 
Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through. 
This is to my family, I'll be there for you.
[Chorus]
Hide my face again, harbor in the shadows
Feel this weight of sin hammering away
Die, with the guilt of a thousand AWOL soldiers
Die, watch the scythe usher me astray
I can't go on this way
Not as I am today
The ugly side of me is strong
Take aim, a loaded gun.
Pull back on all who run.
A coward's truth inside the wrong.
This means war
This means war
This means war
Lash your tongue of bane
Carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust
Battle never ends
Lie! Mask the pain
Of a child who's forsaken
Lie! To myself
Praise the new regime
I left me long ago
Reasons you'll never know
No one to miss me when I'm gone
With no more words to say
No argument to stay.
Another post I don't belong
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
No home to call my own
No finding someone new
No one to break the fall
No one to see me through
No name to carry on
No promise for today
No one to hear the call
No tattered flag to raise
Walk the razor's edge
Cut into the madness
Question all you trust
Buy into the fear
I see the man ripping at my soul now
I, I know the man
I know him all too well
There's nothing here for free
Lost who I want to be
My serpent blood can strike so cold
On any given day
I'll take it all away
Another thought I can't control
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
The wind of life and air from above smells of death.
Angels sing of the end.
Nothing you say and nothing you try can change time.
Human race prepares to die
Lost the meaning of our stay
Learn to live another day
Doubt the choices that we made
I know that we can't hide our shame
It's only in disguise
Drowning in our own debris
Fool our thoughts as though we're free
Close our eyes so we can see
The depth of all we mean to be
If only in my eyes
I don't mind
(Read the writing on the wall)
Mother cries
(Tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days
To lose it once again
In a way
So try and love me while you can
And take the time to understand
As long as I can touch your face
You know I'll never leave this place
If only in my mind
I don't mind
(Read the writing on the wall)
My cry
(Tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days
To lose it once again
But I seem to find out better ways
To consciously pretend
Sadness all I want to say
And it seems to run away
I'll run away
With you tonight
Launder all my sins away
And just like that mistakes are made
You know
Tonight the world dies
I don't mind
(Read the writing on the wall)
Mother cries
(Tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days
To lose it once again
But I seem to find out better ways
To consciously pretend
Keep on writing you're just raping yourself
(Nothing can take my mind away) from them
Don't you ask about me, ask about somebody else
(Once I've fallen there's many stories to tell)
I can feel it, won't embrace it, its overwhelming how far ya take it
(Stuck in a state of questioning)
And don't you tell me you know we're destined, you won't convince me, I won't listen
(Resentment building, you've put our lives on hold)
Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always is known, I'll find my way there
But Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time.
I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control
Play your game and walk away, your integrity don't mean a shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out
Label me, that's fine, I'll be somebody else
(Nothing in front of me but holes ahead)
Lie about my life, have a story to tell
(Lights went down, was on the edge and I fell)
Oh you're so insightful, let me remind you to twist and break me
Should make you worried
(Long way to go and you're right there)
Two-faced liar, don't try and know me, deceit brings fire, makes you can't breath
(pick at pieces of my body below)
I never bothere with all the rumors, too much garbage (all the same)
(I know my destination)
I'll stand right here, come on you falsehood deceitful liar 
(There's no shame)
Don't ever take my side, I know you're never right
I'll justify the means (nothing's what it seems)
I'll stand around and fight, but there's no point tonight, been chained to this machine
Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always unknown, I'll find my way there
But Goddamn impostor are you out of your mind
I walk down these roads alone and now you're seen here
My feelings that I'm having towards you are perfectly clear (I control this ride)
My devil's appetite is tonight and now I'm alright
But you Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time
Play your game you better walk away cause your integrity don't mean a shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out
I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control
Don't try and get the best of me (no one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache (lonely, don't try and prey on me)
I feel your world dying, no more use in tryin'
And my body's trashed and low, but you I'll never show myself or what's inside
And you've seen it all before but I'll settle the score, I'll never join your side.
Slit my wrists, take away the pain
Slit my throat, everyone's to blame
Lost in the fields of confusion
Restless nights, they're not far away
I came here for something and I'm not turning back
A calm piece of mind but you still hold my keys
Keeping my fate deep within your threshold
Petty inconvenience but it means the world to me
You have the power
To set me free
Caught in your grasp, how?
Just let me be
Give me control out
Out of these depths
A fiery hell
I pray for death
I've been the wrong one time and time again
Now I'm on my knees forgive me please
Tore out my heart and handed to me on a silver platter
Sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion
You made me this way
I am the product of your creation
Sew up the hole, and now, look the other way
Now you've turned your back on me
You've turned away from me
The future's much to far away to see
I hope you learn the truth
Not the way things were meant to be with me and you
Somewhere life is good, and things go as they should
It's hard to find, but that's alright yeah
Searching for the way, push harder everyday
It's deep inside, that shining light yeah
But I'm scarred, by barriers placed in my path
I'm scathed

This ride that takes me through life
Leads me into darkness but emerges into light
No one can ever slow me down
I'll stay unbound

Sometimes when we're young, and always on the run
It gets so dark and I know that place yeah
So don't be too concerned, you've got a lot to learn
Well so do I and we've got plenty of time yeah
Don't fall off the track yet with so many races to go
Hold on

This ride that takes me through life
Leads me into darkness but emerges into light
No one can ever slow me down
I'll stay unbound

Some live so wrong, with what we do is each his own
But living in fear, endless shame for countless years
I never lived in fear I knew I'd die another day
I never viewed my life as something... slipping away

Some live so wrong, with what we do is each his own
But living in fear, endless shame for countless years
I never lived in fear I knew I'd die another day
I never viewed my life as something... slipping away

There's nothing here to take for granted
With each breath that we take
The hands of time strip youth from our bodies
And we fade
Memories remain
As time goes on

There's nothing here to take for granted
With each breath that we take
The hands of time strip youth from our bodies
And we fade
Memories remain
As time goes on
"I'll try," she said as he walked away
"Try not to lose you"
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception, unmasked fear
"I'll be here waiting tested and secure"

Nothing hurts my world,
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood,
You'll be the one to fall

"I wish I could be the one,
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand,
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back,
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me"

Nothing will last in this life,
Our time is spent constructing,
Now you're perfecting a world, meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me,
Squeeze till I cannot breathe,
This air tastes dead inside me,
Contribute to our own plague
Break all your promises,
Tear down this steadfast wall,
Restraints are useless here,
Tasting salvation's near

Nothing hurts my world,
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood,
You'll be the one to fall

"I wish I could be the one,
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand,
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back,
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me"
House full of roses
A letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages
For anyone who cares
Collage of broken words
and stories full of tears
Remembering your life
'Cause we wish that you were here
Nothing is harder
Than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay
It's the end of all you know
Time keeps passing by
But it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind
But some too deep to feel
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime
Some days you'll find me
In a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself
'Bout the things I'll never know
What's left to find
'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time
Can we even up the score?
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime
And nothing lasts forever
For all good days it's true
I'd rather tred it all
For somehow saving you
It must have been the season
That've threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall
Now I'm searching for a sign
So don't need your salvation
With promises and kind
And all those speculations
Save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason
A reason just to stay
Some just can't be bothered
To stick around another day
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside (oh)
We've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
Wake the ones and rise tonight
Fallen souls we shine so bright

Rise now and ever
Leave your memory

Rise now and ever
Leave your memory

No one can touch us
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence
One step from lashing out at you 
You want in to get under my skin
And call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do?
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been
Belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time
Respect, walk
What do you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Now you're talking to me?
Run your mouth when I'm not around
It's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing you song?
Those same friends tell me your every word
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been
Belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time
Respect, walk
What do you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Respect, walk
What do you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Now you're talking to me?
No way, punk
Respect, walk
What do you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Respect, walk
What do you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Now you're talking to me?
Welcome home, boy
Your hazel-green tint eyes watching every move I make
And that feeling of doubt, it's erased
I'll never feel alone again with you by my side
You're the one and in you I confide more
And we have gone through good and bad times
But your unconditional love was always on my mind
You've been there from the start for me
And your love's always been true as can be
I give my heart to you
I give my heart 'cause nothing
Can compare in this world to you
And we have gone through good and bad times
But your unconditional love was always on my mind
You've been there from the start for me
And your love's always been true as can be
I give my heart to you
I give my heart 'cause nothing
Can compare in this world to you
I give my heart to you

Hey kid (hey kid)
Do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
Life's so reckless, tragedy endless
Welcome to the family
Hey
There's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family
Not long ago you find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you find yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now, can you look at yourself?
You can't win this fight
In a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight
Hey kid (hey kid)
I have to question
What's with the violent aggression
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family
Hey
Why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty rerun
Welcome to the family
I try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now, so have you figured it out?
You can't win this fight
And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!
Here for you and all mankind
I've lost my mind
Psychotic rounds in rabid dementia
I won't be fine
I see you're a king who's been dethroned
Cast out in a world you've never know
Stand down, place your weapon by your side
It's our war in the end, we'll surely lose but that's alright
So have you figured it out now, so have you figured it out?
And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight
Deep inside where nothing's fine
I've lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside
I've lost my
Deep inside where nothing's fine
I've lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside
I've lost my
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here
Before the story begins, is it such a sin,
For me to take what's mine, until the end of time
We were more than friends, before the story ends,
And I will take what's mine, create what
God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long,
I was weak with fear that
Something would go wrong,
Before the possibilities came true,
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears,
Conjuring her deepest fears
(come here you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times,
I can't believe it,
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
Eyes over easy, eat it eat it eat it

She was never this good in bed
Even when she was sleepin'
Now she's just so perfect I've
Never been quite so fucking deep in
It goes on and on and on,
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever,
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
Let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
But baby don't cry

Now possibilities I'd never considered,
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard,
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave,
To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it eat it eat it

Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
Let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
But baby don't cry

I will suffer for so long
(What will you do, not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, If it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again

We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

"Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life'"
"Yes, I do"
"Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life'"
"I do"
"I now pronounce you"

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
Let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah
But baby don't cry
Our day has come
It's drawn in the sky
So don't shead a tear now
Be thankful for the time
Life wouldn't be so precious dear if there never was an end
Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
We stand on the edge now
We've come so far
Through all the dust it becomes clear
You will always be my heart
There's no death, no end of time when I'm facing it with you
Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us Acid rain
Stand near to me
Don't look be brave
Over the blackened moon
I'll carry you away
Through the planets we fly
Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us Acid rain
Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
so unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

I see a distant light, but girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see so how did this come to be
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife

'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here

A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope you might
take me back inside when the time is right

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken; I'm choking on this ecstasy)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live)

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope you might
take me back inside when the time is right
I feel insane every single time
I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways
And that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect
Love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face
I may have forced the scale to tip
I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane
(I'm not)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Set it off)
Come back again, it's almost easy
Shame pulses through my heart
From the things I've done to you
It's hard to face but the fact remains
That this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied
With suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin
But deep inside I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane
(I'm not)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Set it off)
Come back again, it's almost easy
(You learned your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(It's still your fault)
Come back again, it's almost easy
Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
Now let me make it right
(Make it all right)
I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane
(I'm not)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Set it off)
Come back again, it's almost easy
(You learned your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(It's still your fault)
Come back again, it's almost easy
Lived through you
Safe with how we lived our lives
With how it all turned out (But things are bound to change)
Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout
Will make you change your mind
Sometimes life is altered
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
When I see you, I can read it in your eyes
Fate misunderstood (But things are bound to change)
Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for
Thinking with your heart
Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know
Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be alright
I know, I know
I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold, so black, so alone
Living goes by fast, catch your breath
And it will pass you by
And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold
Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
Took me years to make my motives clear
And the days have not been kind
Once a steady gaze and charming smile
Has been buried in the lines I find
I walk in the noise, quiet employs
And darkness seems to know just where I am
Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
There are words that never found my lips
There are words I'd soon forget
Thought the trick was never to look back
But it seems I've lost my grip, I slip
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow all the bullets bear my name
Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago, I know
I struck all the matches stuck in the ashes
Forgive me, won't you simply speak my name
Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now 
Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago
(He who makes a beast out of himself)
(Gets rid of the pain of being a man)
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried to drive on through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
As I adjust to my new sights 
The rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger and I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction follows me, show me what it's like to be set free
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
So sorry you're not here 
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me 
But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today
Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions but most just pass us by 
Don't want your absolution 'cause I can't make it right
I'll make a beast out of myself 
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
So sorry you're not here 
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me 
But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
I've known it from the start all 
These good ideas will tear your brains apart
Scared but you can follow me 
I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die
This shining city built of gold, a far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye round here look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast, ten horns raised from his heads
Symbolic woman sits on his throne, but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The Beast and the Harlot
She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen, Myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot
She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
The day has come for all us sinners
If you'r enot a servant you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city looking back on her to see there's nothin' around
I don't believe in fairy tales
And no one wants to go to Hell
You made the wrong decision
And it's easy to see
Now if you want to serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever
She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
Passion in my eyes, I lived it everyday, but how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do (finish you)
I feel it burn inside, burn like the rising sun
Lifted into the sky, took away the only thing I loved
I know after tonight all your power crumbles in my arms
So don't worry, I'll be fine, when my life ends, I'll leave this scar
A smoking gun in your hand, now don't you realize what you've done
Put a bullet in his back, your hero since you were so young
How could you kill the man who brought salvation through your pain
He must mean everything to end it all this shameful way
I started here so young and helped you get along
Just did it for the love, and people healed through us
Don't live your life in vain, don't take it out on me
You're cracked, so just remember, I'm not your enemy
I don't deserve to fall this way, by a man who felt betrayed
I felt so down now you're around to rescue me
Every note and every word i'm listening
Sometimes problems seem too deep to take
Sometimes I cry thinking my future looks so bleak
Finally, together we were destined, I know what's best for us in the end
Someone hear me, someone stop me, someone listen, why aren't you listening?
And we're at it again, I turn around another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin, but I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're followin'
Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit behind the blood
Between the red and white and blue
But it's too deep for you to see 
And everyone eventually will take the step 
'Cause it's in sight you take the left I'll take the right 
I fell the hate you've built for me and I say pay attention baby)
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
But it wasn't a sin, a sorry life in judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forgot
How to speak how to ask all the questions
The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do 
From on the outside looking in 
Your government is listenin' to push you on the story of immortal father 
Mortal son give them your mind 
And all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)
If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell 
And your future's a fuckin' disaster can't you see
Don't give them all the power 
When your future's in desperate trouble baby
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact 
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done 
With no place to hide and having no place to
Running away from condition
I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seductive system
Most would claim I live a lie 
When pointing out it's easy to predict these things
Every color has its side
They live together vote 
But most won't read between these lines
Please help us, please save us 
Of course they have control, we're all the same
Up on the cross
Crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends
It won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder 'bout how you sold you mind
Body and soul
Looking at the fields so green 
I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow 
But decisions you have made will leave you empty
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact 
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide 
And having no place to run
You've fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dyin'
How it ends I'll never know
Just live you life blind like me
Doc, I'm dying, I'm feeling compromised (feeling compromised)
And so dehumanized (and so dehumanized)
I lost my final fight to disease, I feel that this is where it ends
I need that shot to enter my vein
My Brompton cocktail blend

'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle long
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
In a lie

I'm tired, induced euphoria (induced euphoria)
To help me move along (help me move along)
I wanna meet my maker in peace, I want to feel alive again
So put that smile back on my face and mix it strong my friend

'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle long
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
And I take my life tonight 'cause I have the right to die how I wanna
And leave how I arrived, so alive

I believe my sins have been forgiven
And I believe my choice will save me from this life
Please don't question why
My sins have been forgotten
I believe I'll find peace in afterlife
Please don't question why
I left this way

'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle long
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
And I take my life tonight 'cause I have the right to die how I wanna
And leave how I arrived, so alive
(alive)
Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that ya might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real
Still I'm on my way
On and on it goes
Vacant hope to take
Hey I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive
I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade
On and on it goes
Wash my view away
Hey I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive
Take you down now
Burn it all out
Throw you all around
Get you're fuckin' hands off me
What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul
While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with hands of fate
Shame to find out when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive
This is now your life
Die buried alive
Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me though everyone that I defeat
Don"t need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away
Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (See it in my eyes)
Now I can understand
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Whoa, yeah!
You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day
The fear in you is here to stay
So keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words I say
Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes)
Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Huh! Yeah, yeah!
Running from me before I tear you down (Be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (It feels so right)
I won't help you, let you run away (Despise what you say)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (We won't be there by your side)
Salvation's dying (Somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end
Sweet child we'll miss you
Whoa, so far away, far away
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes)
Now I can understand (Put faith in you for the last time)
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Falling away
Can't buy back time
Burn it down anyways
Some people live out selfish desire
Some choose to shout when they speak and they'll be the star
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice, one for tomorrow
They say we've lost our minds
We've just gained control
Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee
No mockery
Somehow we still carry on
(Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear)
Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky, guiding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow
Destroy their perfect crime, watch the power fold
Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee
No mockery
Somehow we still carry on
Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bend in knee
No mockery
Somehow we still carry on
Carry on
(Give me your hand
Blood is spilt and man will follow
Infernal man, punishment too great to bear)
Conceived and born was one of light
Rain and dark, the other born black night

Raise your head and taste the courage
(The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brothers eyes tonight

It's cold tonight as the clouds turn gray
And from my hands to my brothers grave
You took his side, you took his gift
Feel the power of a fallen man, crestfallen man

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the site of the One
A punishment sent from his hand
A hardship no one should know
Now go out of the site of the One
Away in this land you must go

Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit
Dust begins to fall to the ground (And you sit there and do nothing)
The air is cold and thin (You're content with doing nothing)
Thoughts are haunting me as I look around (But in my life, I wanted more)
This will never end, when I'll bleed forever (This will never end)

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

Outside shell is strong (There is nowhere to run and hide) confident
But slowly eats away (Stuck alone inside your head)
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight (Guess you're better off dead)
Through my pores it seems to seep (Your mind bleeding)
When I'll bleed forever

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

And you sit there and do nothing
You're content with doing nothing

There's nowhere to run and hide
When you're living to die
Stuck alone inside your head,
Better off dead
The phone would ring in the empty house,
No one's around

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

But in my life, I wanted more
I needed more, I taste more
I've been away
Searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas
Fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies
I've stood in hell
Where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes
Walked many roads
To witness ancient idols
And found the great gates of fire
Had many storms
Questioned my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The hangman searching
For bones he can borrow
While I escaped in the night 
Final plight
Live again
I won't sin
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home
Escape the hell
Of capitulated mortals
And drink the blood of a king
A desert rain
Has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems
Live again
I won't sin
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home
My story ends
Not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world
Through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is
I've been told
So I go
Live again
I won't sin
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Standing in the shade of altruism, answering the call
Came a modern messiah to save us all
Something far beyond the work of fiction, Positronic brain
A world that's void of all the anguish and suffering, pain
Better tame your convictions before you go and open the cage
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find
Never held a high regard for Darwin, selection takes too long
A little kick in the pool shouldn't do us wrong
Devouring the very last invention man would ever need
But exponential growth is a frightening thing, indeed
Sweet bohemian jury rounded up and hung in the streets
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find
Sometimes when I look up to the sky I have to wonder are we "summoning the demon" you and I?
Have you noticed that I'm needin' it more now, more than it needs me
Got a couple of billion that seem to agree
Surfing in an artificial dimension, but we're not alone
Now the master has become just a stepping stone, oh
Like a blow to the ego the bitter pills are harder to take
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find
We're creating god, in search of the divine
We're creating god. Committing suicide
Dark years, brought endless rain
Out in the cold I lost my way
But storms won't last to clear the air
For something new
The sun came out and brought you through
A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day
I've been wrong, time's over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me
Crimson day
Don't speak, no use for words
Lie in my arms, sleep secure
I wonder what you're dreaming of
Lands rare and far
A timeless flight to reach the stars
A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day
I've been wrong, time's over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me
Crimson day
I've come so far to meet you here
To share this life with one I hold so dear
And I won't speak but what is true
The world outside created just for you
It's for you, for you
I've been wrong, time's over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me
Crimson day
Shhh quiet might piss somebody off
Like me motherfucker you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds
Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(broken glass, your fake reflection)
I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone
So how does it feel to know that someone's kid
In the heart of America has blood on their hands
Fighting to defend your rights
So you can maintain a lifestyle
That insults his family's existence
Well, where I'm from we have a special
Salute that we aim high in the air
Towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers
(fuck you)
Shhh quiet might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your generous hypocrisy
Collecting enemies
Tabloid gossip queen worthless man
(there's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(right this way you've dug your own grave)
I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone
All the way from the east to the west we
Got this high society
Looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every
Direction and blaming their
Own nation for who wins the elections
They've never contributed a fucking thing to the
Country they love to criticize
Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first
Shhh quiet might piss somebody off
Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(lies inside your head your best friend)
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
(broken glass your fake reflection)
I've had enough
It's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far
A clone
My sixteen locked and loaded
All fear has been avoided
You say the words and my weapon is drawn
This one could be my last time
Some people call it war crime
I may be staring down a lethal sight
(To die)
Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line
I do this for my family
My daughter loves her daddy
Too many talk down on things they don't know
With colors never faded
Reckless and unabated
They may take me but never take us all (I'll crawl)
Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering no man should ever know
Leaving my faith on the danger line
I know what you're thinking
I've been there before
So think of the times
The time we spent laughing away
So think of the times at home
Now I found myself in my own blood
(never thought I'd lay in my own blood)
The damage done is far beyond repair
I never put my faith in up above
(never had much faith in up above)
But now, I'm hoping someone's there
Never meant to leave this world alone
I never meant to hurt the ones who cared
And all this time I thought we'd just grow old
You know, no one said it's fair
Tell my baby girl that it's alright
I've sung my last song today
Remind the Lord to leave his light on for me
I'm free
Darkness coats us.
The smell of fall.
Changing season.
The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path,
the chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.
Imprisoned souls.
Trapped for eternity.
Black crows break the silence.

The garden of the dead s alive tonight and you can't stop it.
Just enjoy it.
Open up your mind and you will feel it too.
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.
You can feel the thoughts of the dead.
Feeling the thoughts of the dead.

True or false, it's still there, teaching me.
True or false, still there, teaching me.
You can feel it tonight.
The wood has rotted away.
Take the time absorb it.
Their time is slipping away.
Stone all carved by hand.
Statues that resemble their faces.
They still breathe.
Come join us.

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone, and
I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts
As time crumbles away
Time crumbles away
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love purpose undefined
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
And where I'd love to be, oh yeah
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
To hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again
There's nothing here for me on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
And all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again
Some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love purpose undefined
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need the person who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again
Hard news, taken harder, don't look to me
Disappointed, we don't agree, I don't need your praise
(Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me)
Never asked you to like me
I don't need your praise (we won't play your games)

Look down on me, spit in my face
You're nothing to me, not to me

Darkened eyes you'll see
There is no hope, no savior in me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by, no one will care
What happens to me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore

My presence won't be ignored, no not today
Don't walk in my direction, turn the other way
(Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me)
Asking questions, predetermined answers
You won't find them here (we don't want your opinion)

And I don't want you, I won't let you think
Compromise is near 'cause it's not near

Darkened eyes you'll see
There is no hope, no savior in me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore
Learned from years gone by, no one will care
What happens to me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore

I'm alone in here
No more feelings
Killed my fears
Don't ask you'll never know
You're left behind and I'll be exposed

Far away, you keep on trying
Holding me down, breaking away
Trying to distance my life
Not one in the crowd, but one with the answer
The one that can change your mind

But it's not true, I don't need you
Don't waste your time and don't waste mine
I'm not your friend, won't soothe your soul
And in the end you're all dead to me
The lives of some men
If walls can taught to spills the lies
We'll see the world through devil's eyes
I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it too high
I gotta a inch with a loaded head trigger
And a one way ticket to fly
When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doing their time
Caught your eye in the corner,
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter,
gotta fix what don't belong
I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doing their time
That's just a price to play
So tell me what you like
Gotta hand on the kerosene match tonight, right
Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar
Got a pretty little body to grind
I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
Watch the fall
You lost my attention
After all
Everybody's doing their time, time
Black enchanting eyes,
Cut through my heart
With no regret or sign of life
They tear apart my pride
And cold runs through my veins
I feel their stare from miles
Haunting every step
And they won't stop hunting me down
I know the time will come,
When all around me's burned
And you'll still see me there
Asking where you went too
And what person brought you here
And why you left the burning children
Cold out in the night
And calling for you all alone

Dark in their hearts,
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down (holding me down)

They'll find you alone
And your desperate and villainous ways
Turning their hearts into stone
They seek more then vengeance
Look in their eyes your pain is their satisfaction
Look in their eyes and see the darkness take hold
I'm controlled by fate (waiting for)
Tired of your parade (waiting for)
No sign of vengeance (waiting for)
Burn for the rest of time (waiting)

Hear the haunting words (They'll find you alone)
Lost children with no heart are crying (Turning their hearts into stone)
And your the lost mother their calling (Go now, run and hide)
I hear them crying at night (your pain is their satisfaction)
Outside when the planets are falling (for the rest of time)
They want to feel and know you hear them (Go now, run and hide)

Dark in their hearts,
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down (holding me down)

Go now
Run and hide

Eternal rest in time
Eternal rest in time
Lights paint the windows in the sky
The past is sewn
In pursuit our spirit shown
But for now there's no one home
Heavens work on borrowed time
(walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind
My sweet Medusa, reflect the empty of our being
Snakes born of fire, conjure the demons of our dreams
In void we illustrate our lives
Emerge in small
Heed the sign meant to evolve
To the end we send the call
Heavens work on borrowed time
(walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind
Where children shiver in the cold
The sun will shine
Just a touch to heal the blind
In ourselves we hope to find
Heavens work on borrowed time
(walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind
Alone
Now I think I understand
How this world can overcome a man
Like a friend we saw it through
In the end I gave my life for you
Gave you all I had to give
Found a place for me to rest my head
While I may be hard to find
Heard there's peace just on the other side
Not that I could
Nor that I would
Let it burn
Under my skin
Let it burn
Left this life to set me free
Took a piece of you inside of me
All this hurt can finally fade
Promise me you'll never feel afraid
Not the I could
Nor that I would
Let it burn
Under my skin
Let it burn
I hope it's worth it, here on the highway, yeah
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you
So tell everybody, the ones who walk beside me, yeah
I hope you'll find your own way when I'm not with you tonight
I hope it's worth it, what's left behind me, yeah
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you
So tell everybody, the ones who walk beside me, yeah
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you tonight
As a young boy chasing dragons with your wooden sword so mighty,
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.
Times change very quickly,
And you had to grow up early,
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.
CHORUS
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade,
In a corner, forgotten by no one.
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honor.
The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil men.
CHORUS
Pre-flight delight,
Defaced street lights,
A pyramid mind fuck,
Don't leave your seats now,
Popcorn everywhere, canned,
Cliche people organs rare,
Corn everywhere canned,
Cliche people organs rare,
Rare

I want to be,
A fallen ruby,

Don't leave your seats now,

Walk with me my little child,
To the forest of denial,
Speak with me my only mind,
Walk with me until the time,
And make the forest turn to wine,
You take the legend for a fall,
You saw the product,

Why can't you see that you are my child,
Why don't you know that you are my mind,
Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you,
Take this promise to the end of you.

Walk with me my little friend,

Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you,

Take this promise for a ride,
You saw the forest, now come inside,
You took the legend for its fall,
You saw the product of it all,
No televisions in the air,
No circumcisions on the chair,
You made the weapons for us all,
Just look at us now,

Why don't you know that you are my mind,
Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you,

I will never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart all 
Because we all live in the valley of the walls when we speak 
We can peak from the windows of their mouths to see the land 
The women chant as they fly up to the sun.

Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings 
Trying to soar by being a whore of life 
And almost everything the sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead 
But now's a bird able to fly able to die able to break your cursed earth

Have you ever wanted to die, you ever want to die?
Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly,
Don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side,
Never try to die, you ever try to die.

Stretching, filing,
Against her skin,
Blessed are those,
Who are not kin,
In sin we breathe,
In sex we tie,
Duct tape her legs,
To the red sky,
Foolsome flesh allowances,
The pansies raided the pantry of,
Gabardine dreams, promiscuous,
Delight, deny not the flavor,
Custard dreams,
Abusing, musing,
Marmalade flesh
Naked spread am I,
Actors of the tragic fanthom,
Extend your legs to great saturn,
Brown table tops scream for cover,
At the sight of your new lover,
If today I die,
And can't deny,
The poison chosen,
For tonight.
Borrowed dreams,
Hollowed reveries,
Metal pillows,
Pewter yellows,
Furry roadkill,
House on the hill,
Pouring gravy,
On her thighs still,
If today I die,
And can't deny,
The poison chosen,
For tonight.

My four walls follow me through my past

I emerged in London rain
And you waiting there swimming through apologies
I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember the soldier standing next to me
Riding on the metro
I went smiling as you took my hand
So removed we spoke in France
You were passed as shallow word
The years have passed and still a hurt
You were passed as shallow word
Years have passed and still a hurt
I can see it now smiling as I pulled away...
Sorry
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
"I'll love you always" filled my eyes
I remember the night we walked along the Seine
Riding on the metro
I remember a feeling coming over me
The soldier turned, then walked away
I remember hating you for loving me
Riding on the metro

Blame, hate, for fate's seed.
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Need the ones you love and love the ones you need,
Need the one you love and love the ones you bleed,
Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you breath
Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you see.

From where you see the ships afar,
From a well trained eye,
The waves all keep on crashing by,

Then you own the working class,

Warning,
Post hypnotic suggestions,
Running the ships ashore,
The orange light that follows,
Will soon proclaim itself a God,

The fog will surely chew you up,

Where you going,
To the bottom?

No one, No one's gonna save us now
Not even God
No one saved us

Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?

The bombs are falling overhead with no sight
While you are talking all detached, detached, detached, detached, detached
We're going down
In a spiral to the ground
No one, No one's gonna save us now
Not even God
No one saved us
No one saved us
No one saved us
No one's gonna save us now

The unsettled mind is at times an ally,
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves,
The senses collect undeniable data,
About beta carotene and theta waves,
The unsettled mind is at times an ally,
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves,
Then, the senses wanted the sky,
All rise, Eyes bow,
Time feels like a midnight ride,
Finality waits outside,
Weeping in perplexity's arms,
Caressing our smiles inside,
The National debt is at times an ally,
Leaving the people to fend for them selves,

All rise, Eyes bow,
Now our eyes, have been found
Time feels like a midnight ride,
Finality waits outside,
Weeping in perplexity's arms,
Caressing our smiles inside,
Wanting to get you high,
Waiting to touch the sky,

Finality waits outside,
Weeping in perplexity's arms,
Caressing our smiles inside

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Blast off!
It's party time!
And we don't live in a fascist nation!
Blast off!
It's party time!
And where the fuck are you?

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?

Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?

Kneeling roses disappearing into
Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into fort knox stealing
Our intentions

Hangers sitting dripped in oil
Crying freedom
Handed to obsoletion,
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

I'm walking through your streets
Where all your money's earning
Where all your buildings crying
And clueless neckties working
Revolving fake lawn houses
Housing all your fears
Desensitized by T.V.
Overbearing advertising
God of consumers
And all your crooked pictures looking good
Mirrors filtering information through the public eye
Designed for profit sharing
Your neighbor, what a guy
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Modern globalization
Coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations with a blinded flag
Manufacturing consent is the name of the game
The bottom line is money nobody gives a fuck
4000 hungry children
Leave us per hour from starvation
While billions are spent on bombs
Creating death showers
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Why must we kill our own kind?
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom,
Every time you drop a bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Every time you drop the bomb
Jump, bounce, down, up

I went out on a date,
With a girl, a bit late,
She had so many friends,
Gliding through many hands.
I brought my pogo stick,
Just to show her a trick,
She had so many friends,
Gliding through many hands.

Jump pogo,
Bounce pogo,
Down, up
Jump, bounce, up, down

Unannounced twister games,
All players with no names,
They lined up double quick,
But just one pogo stick,
Everyone gets to play,
Runaway, expose',
It was so exotic,
But just one pogo stick.

Jump pogo,
Bounce pogo,
Down, up
Jump, bounce, up, down

Oh, I'd like to spread you out,
Touching whoever's behind

Jump pogo,
Bounce pogo,
Down, up
Jump, bounce, up, down
Bounce pogo,
Down pogo, up pogo
Fish that don't drown,
Life in a bubble jungle,
I wouldn't frown,
Not short another chuckle,
Snake in the ground,
But I was in there for you,
Now leaving town,
Life in a bubble jungle
Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling,
Appeasing,
The power struggle
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle,
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle
Wearing a crown,
Life in a bubble jungle,
Chasing a clown,
Not short another chuckle,
Snake in the ground,
But I was waiting for you,
Now we have found,
Life in a bubble jungle
Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We're the power struck
Believing, then keeling,
Appeasing,
The power struggle
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle,
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle.
Left with no arms,
In the power struggle,
Left with no arms,
In the power struggle.
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
Your life is in a bubble jungle
Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We're the power struck
Believing, then keeling,
Appeasing,
The power struggle
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle,
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle
Left with no arms,
In the power struggle,
Left with no arms,
Right here in the power struggle

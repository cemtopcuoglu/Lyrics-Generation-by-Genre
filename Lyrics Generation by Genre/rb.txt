My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet

Sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The Devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie

You just gotta sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie

Don't you blame it sunshine
You just gotta moonlight
You just wanna good times
Yeah, oh boogie

Blame it on yourself
(Sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault
(Moonlight)
But yours and that boogie
(Good times)
All night long
(Boogie)

Can't stop that boogie
(Sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault
(Moonlight)
But yours and that boogie
(Good times)
Dancin' all night long
(Boogie)

Blame it on yourself
(Sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault
(Moonlight)
But yours and that boogie, boogie, boogie
(Good times)
All night long

There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache things
What can I do but wait for you
Darling the days
I had looked cold

Now our separate mays we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay

And you got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever think that has to be
Turns your dreams around

Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's going to kill me
Not to be with you? 
But I want you to be happy

If parting is what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my best
For your happiness in a world that's there

Should you write and it's not there
Call on me
(Call on me) 

Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me... call on me

Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me...

She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing

I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear her crying here
And I can hear her calling me.

Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

You know I work too hard for this kind of pay
I wrote a letter for the ghetto of the CIA
I don't care a jack all about what you do
Just put your dime on the line, girl, 'cause I owe you

Somebody said, get up and stand
On how you feel
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't taking it, you

Cheater
Boy, you better go an get yourself some attitude
I know your name on the game isn't "I owe you"
You're telling me that your coming to a compromise
You're smiling at me while you're stealing right before my eyes

Somebody said, get up and stand
On how you feel
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't taking it, you

Cheater
I break my backbone, baby
I start to give it up
Life is an aggravator
It all starts piling up
I broke my radiator
I fixed the telephone
I break my limbs, my body
So don't you ever call

I don't care a jack all about what you do
Just sign your name on the line, baby, "I owe you"
You are a

Cheater
Somebody said, get up and stand
On how you feel
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't taking it,

Cheater
Cheater

And I'll soon show you a rhyme

Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man his daydreams 
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)
Oh, I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner, yes I do
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky

Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feelin sad
Someone is taking a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
when your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is reach for the truth, the truth

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

Change the world

The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

I can not sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

The game of love
Is such a beautiful game
If you've got time, little girl
I'd like to explain
All the do's and don't
All the wills and won't

So Lend an ear, darling dear
(Sweet darling dear)
Do be sincere
And true love will appear
Don't be shy
Or love will pass you by
If you will
My heart you may steal
If you don't
The game of love you lose alone

(Darling dear)
Do be sincere

First I'll place my arms
So gently around you
(Then)
Then whisper darling I'm so glad I found you

Then your lips unwind
A simple touch wouldn't mind
A kiss will stay, darling dear
(Sweet darling)
Darling, darling dear, yeah
(Sweet darling dear)
Darling dear
(Sweet darling dear)
Darling dear

She wrote "Dear Michael
You'll probably never get this letter
Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel 
I'll write a hundred more" 

"Dear Michael, every time your record's on
(Michael Michael) 
Michael, I close my eyes and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me." 

And then she wrote,
"Michael, I love you
I held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
'Cause I want to be more than just your number one fan"

I'm gonna answer your letter
(Michael Michael) 
I'll start beginning with the ABC's of loving you
(I love ya) 
(She wrote) 
(Michael Michael) 
(I love ya) 
Your letter really touched my heart
(She wrote) 
I've been dreaming of meeting the picture
That you send along, signed with all your love 
(Michael Michael) 
(I wrote ya) 
(She wrote) 

I'm gonna write you back, ouuh, I promess you that
(Won't you write me back?, please write me back) 

Girl, I think I love you
(Michael Michael) 
Hurry, hurry mister postman, take my letter, tell her I love her
(She wrote) 
(Won't you write me back, please write me back) 
(Michael Michael) 
(She wrote) 

Hurry, hurry mister postman, take my letter tell her I love her
(Won't you write me back, please write me back) 

(Michael Michael) 
Yeah, 
(I wrote you) 
(She wrote) 
I'm gonna write you back
I promess you that

You never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying that's okay
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff the you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Di-ana, nah
Dirty Diana
Let me be!

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's says that's okay
Hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah

Dirty Diana!
It's Diana! Yeah, yeah

She said I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleppin' alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to
Say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me,
She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin' baby I'm alright
I said but unlock the door.
Because I forgot the key.
She said he's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Di-ana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Di-ana, nah
Dirty Diana
Come on!

Father comes home from work, and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says "What's going on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone!"

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?

If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat!

Save me (cause I don't wanna know)
Save me

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old!

Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand

I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where there will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry

Don't let it get you down
When you're not on top
When a stumble is tool
Puts us up and never stops, no
Ain't double shame, love ain't a friendly game
Don't let it get you down, oh no

Don't let it get you down
When the cards are far
Pick up and let them walked away
Before you loose your heart
Ain't double shame, ove ain't a friendly game
Don't let it get you down
Oh, no

Look at me
Don't it seem like you know what I'm talking about
Talk to me
Let me be, be the one, I can straighten it out girl
Ain't double shame
Love ain't a friendly game
 
Don't let it get you down
I can bring you sunshine, make you happy
Ain't no cloud skies hanging upon me yeah
Don't let it get you down

Don't let it get you down
You can start again
Now yesterday is gone
Let tomorrow be your friend
Hey, don't regret girl
My love is straight ahead
Don't let it get you down
(Oh, no)
Oh no

Look at me

What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things that you said
We were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said were yours and mine

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores

Aah, ooh

What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son

What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine

Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying earth, these weeping shores

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh

Hey, what about yesterday
(What about us)
What about the seas
(What about us)
The heavens are falling down
(What about us)
I can't even breathe
(What about us)
What about apathy
(What about us)
Drowning in the seas
(What about us)
What about the promised land
Preachin' what I believe
(What about us)
What about the holy land
(What about it)
What about the greed
(What about us)
Where did we go wrong
Someone tell me why
(What about us)
What about baby boy
(What about him)
What about the days
(What about us)
What about all their joy
Do we give a damn

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh

Come on and

Ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Come on, ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down, down the road

Pick your left foot up
When your right foot's down
Come on legs keep movin'
Don't you lose no ground
You just keep on keepin'
On the road that you choose
Don't you give up walkin'
Cause you gave up shoes, no

Ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Cause there maybe times
When you think you lost your mind
And the steps you're takin'
Leave you three, four steps behind
But the road you're walking
Might be long sometimes
You just keep on steppin'
And you'll just be fine, yeah

Ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Well there maybe times
When you wish you wasn't born
And you wake one morning
Just to find your courage's gone
But just know that feeling
Only last a little while
You stick with us
And we'll show you how to smile, yeah

Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, get 'em up ease on down

E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A
That's the new word for today
E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A
It's very easy to say
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still
Watch rainbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers

Euphoria
Full euphoria
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthily and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give euphoria invitation
Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other

Everybody's somebody's fool
The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn though a torch will burn
Everybody's somebody's fool

You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you're giving them love
But remember sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one you above

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But oh so sad when it ends
As you got through life remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But oh so sad when it ends
As you got through life remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool

Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
There's something about you, I stare in your eyes
And everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

I want to spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I want to fall with you again

We fought in a battle, nobody won
And left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on

I want to spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I want to fall with you again

You'll try everything you never thought of before
When you live, when you love, and you give them your all
You can always give up some more
Nothing means anything unless you're here with me
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep
Cause you're always there in my dreams

I want to spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I want to fall with you again

I want to spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I want to fall with you again

Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
I found my happiest days when you came to see your grandma in May.
I bumped into you at the corner store;
I told you that you sure looked good, now.
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
Your grandma's house was next to mine,
we were together most of the time.
But summer's gotten away from us;
time's moving too fast for us.
 
Bye, bye, don't turn around, 'cause you might see me cry.
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
When you return to your hometown,
And discuss your trip,
Will I be the guy that you put down,
Or someone that you won't forget, no?
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
I'll never forget you,
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby;
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
Ooh, farewell, farewell.
Ooh, farewell, farewell.
 
If you remember my name, drop a line sometime.
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.

Our love's in motion
 Give me a notion 'cause
 You know we'll never part
 Our love goodbye

 I love in season
 Give me a reason 'cause
 You know we'll never part
 Our love goodbye

Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else

She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But its high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me

Some think that diamond rings; fancy cars
Will make a big impression
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
Cause she still says

That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will

No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I know that I will be the one who will

Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

Miss Lady Girl
Has buried her feelings deep inside
Cause she don't want
To be taken for another ride

She's sick and tired
Of being on that lonely merry-go-round
She just don't know
That the ultimate love of her life is about to be found

They think that ready cash, flashy clothes
Will her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say

That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will

No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I know that I will be the one who will

Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aw

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Yeah yeah!
Don't understand it
You just a dog gone
Aw

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aw

Who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

Aw
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy

Oh
Foolish of me, I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
You've been so true
I've been so cruel to you
Oh, girl please don't leave me

[Chorus]
If you stay I'll find a way
To erase the past
Baby don't leave me
Girl don't take your love from me
Oh girl

What can I say to make you stay
Baby, don't leave me
You've been so kind
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you

[Chorus]

Tell me girl, it's not to late
And you give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl don't take your love
Don't take your love

Bridge:
Girl, if you take your love away from me
I'm gonna be in misery
Your love is the strength that I lean upon
How will I make it when it's gone
Of all the little things I wanted to say
I really wanted to do
Girl, this time
Oh, oh girl I really mean it

[Chorus]

So tell me girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Don't take your love, no no no no no
Don't take your love
Don't leave me girl

Don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me
Don't take your love from me
Oh, don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me

Girl you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah

It's no dreams
But with proof as sweet as you, noo
Apples peaches and cherries
Just won't do, ooh baby

Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it? 

Girl you're so together
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe
(Choose you babe) 
Girl your smile, ooh

Is like the month of may, yeah
When you're near me
The storm clouds stay away, yeah
Even the little honey bees
Turn to you when they need more honey
Love you so much it's not funny

Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way, yeah
Oh, girl, you're so together
Oh, hey girl, girl, eye, eye, popper
A real life traffic stopper
A knock-out queen

Oh, what I mean is
Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you babe

(Girl you're so together) 
Yeah
(And together we can make it all the way) 
Ooh, girl, you're so together

Give me
Give me
Give me

Give me half a chance
Oh your life's gonna have new meaning
Yes it will
Why don't you give me half a chance?
Give me half a chance

I'll prove my love to you, it's true
Come on and give me half a chance
Oh, I'm gonna win you over, yes I will
If you would give me half a chance
Give me half a chance
There's so much I would do for you

Love put us two together
But we don't know how to stay

Give me half a chance
If you just wait and see
Give me half a chance
Your heart will be set free
Give me half a chance

For I know that you'd want me
If you'd only
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance

Girl, I'm gonna win you over, yes I will

Love put us two together
But we don't know how to stay

Give me half a chance
If you just wait and see
Give me half a chance
Your heart will be set free
Give me half a chance

For I know that you'd want me
If you'd only
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance

Give me half a chance
Why don't you give me?
Why don't you give me, baby?

She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spend a lifetime
Looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the
Things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't want to hear it
Give in to me
Give in to me

You and your friends
Were laughing at me in town
But it's okay
And it's okay
You won't be laughing girl
When I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'll, I'll not find
Gotta, the peace of mind no

Don't try to tell me
Because your words
Just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me

Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling

Hear it
Give it to the fire

'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me woman
Quench my desire
Give it to the feeling

Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Gone too soon

I've played the game of love before
Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought
The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living

Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know hat I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay

Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting

That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate

His place in world history

Before we learn to live as brothers
And create one family oh...

Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do it that way
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

(That way) Why why
(That way) Why why

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say,
Why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, cha cha cha cha cha cha
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, da da da da da da da da
Why does he do my that way, I like living this way
Why, oh why, why, why

Looking in my mirror 
Took me by surprise 
I can't help but see you 
Running often through my mind 
Helpless like a baby 
Sensual disguise 
I can't help but love you 
It is getting better all the time 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

Love to run my fingers 
Softly while you sigh 
Love came and possessed you 
Bringing sparkles to your eyes 

Like a trip to heaven 
Heaven is the prize 
And I'm so glad I found you 
You're an angel in disguise 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no

You're givin' me true love
And everyday I thank the Lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting

Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because
I'm lost in a world made for you and me

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony, baby
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, my baby

Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now, baby

Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love

Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love

Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now

Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
I hear a symphony

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

I just can't hold on

I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying
"I do"

"I do"
This thing can't go wrong

This feeling's so strong

Well, my life ain't worth living

If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey farewell to sorrow
This is my life and I,
Want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
Then tell me, just what will I do

Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for

The way you make me feel, babe
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
Hee
My lonely days are gone
Ooh
 
I like the feeling you're giving me
Just hold me closer baby, I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be working from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
 
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
Now baby, hee
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone
Ooh
 
Go on girl
I never felt so in love before
Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
 
The way you make me feel

You really turn me on

You knock me off of my feet darling
Now baby, hee

My lonely days are gone

Ain't nobody's business

But mine and my baby

Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby's
Ooh
 
Thank you
We love you
I love you too
God bless you

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

Then someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
'Cause now since I see you it is all
I want you back
Yes, I do now
I want you back
Oo oo baby
I want you back
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I want you back
Now now now now

Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
(Let me show you now)

Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
'Cause now since I see you it is all

Ah bah bah bah buh
All I want

All I need

All I want
Ah bah bah bah buh
All I need

Oh, just one more chance
To show that I love you, baby!

Baby

I want you back
Forget what happened then

Oh, baby I was blind to let you go
'Cause now since I see you it is all
I want you back
Oh, baby I need one more chance

I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was high-top shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know, I was made to love her
Built a world all around her"
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet Magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, ah
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side, I'll still be standing there

'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know, Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, wee, baby, my baby loves me
My baby needs me
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh, my baby loves me

You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you

I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holdin' on (holdin' on)
Yes I will, yes I will

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, girl, is all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to protect you (yeah baby)
With unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you

I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holdin' on
Ooh ooh ooh
Yes I will (holdin' on, holdin' on)
Yes I will

If you should ever find someone new
I know he better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't
I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know baby I'll be there
I'll be there I'll be there

Just call my name, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Just look over your shoulders honey, ooh!
I'll be there, I'll be there,
Whenever you need me, I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know baby
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Oh oh oh oh I'll be there, I'll be there

If I had my way girl
I'd never leave for a minute
But things don't always turn out
The way we want them to
So while I'm away
I want you to remember
How much I love you
I love you, I love you

Let this love lift you up
When you're feelin' blue
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Even though we both know
You're not in my arms
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart

Just you ask, I'll come back
Though we're miles apart
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And after be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And after we all did?

She told me she forgiving me
A lot time Love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I'm singing to keep from feelin' blue

All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

Here I am so all alone
And I am so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can't explain, I'm all alone
You used to love me
I feel I'm your blue

They told me you should sing a song
And happy with your feelin' blue
I'm singing for so very long
Still crying, tell me what should I do.

All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

She told me she forgiving me
A lot time, love so guaranty (guaranty)
But she left me for another man
And I'm singing crying helplessly
But I'm keep singing

Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

(Wooh)

Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)
Tschada dada dada daa (That's what I want?)
Tschada dada dada daa (Hold on, Hold on)
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh, Wooh, Wooh)
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh I, Oh)
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on take me please
(Set me free)

(Wooh) (Wooh)

(Who's the one that loves you)
(The special one who needs you)
You made the odds a million to me
(No one else can love you)
(Nobody else can need you)
No more than the one whose heart you won't believe

So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love (my love)
That you're my love, baby (my only love)
I'll do it, yes I'd do it
To show I love you

In your eyes
I see no faith
There's an absence of trust
In your embrace

But why would I
Pretend to give
Just to take from the person
For whom I live

(I told you that I love you)
(especially I need you)
You're one love in a million was made from the stars
(And maybe you'd believe me)
(Then maybe you would need me)
But maybe may not ever convince your stubborn heart

[Chorus:]
So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love (my love)
You're my love, baby (my only love)
I'd do it, and I'll do it, yes I'll do it for you
And if I have to stop a river
To make you belive that I'm the one (the one)
That special one you need (that special one)
I'd do it, yes I'd do it (to show I love you)

(Pins and needles sticking in my heart)
(We're so close, but still so far apart)
(What to do, what to do to make you need my love too)

[Chorus]

If'n I was God
Well just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see

If'n I was God
I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me

Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh no I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thanking me

If'n I was God
I'd make us wise 
So everyone could realize
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone

And God that in heaven what I would do
If'n I was you
If'n I was God
Love each other, reach out
And touch somebody's hand

[Chorus]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share

[Chorus]

In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

[Chorus]

Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need

[Chorus]

She's just a lover, who makes me high
Is it worth the giving, is it worth the try
You cannot cleave it, or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Dare me
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Yea
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
Whatever we do to each other
For now we take a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

If you can get it, it's worth a try
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it
She wants to give it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Dare me
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Yea
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)

Just open the door, and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move
Cast the spell

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

She wants to give it,
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it
She wants to give it,
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it
She wants to give it,
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it

Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
Like numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe its because we're so versatile
Style, profile I said
It always brings me back when I hear, "ooh child"
From The Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathon to the very last mile
Well if you battle me I feel reviled
People always sayin' my style is wild
You've got gaul, you've got guile
If you step to me I'm going to rap full file
If you want to battle you're in denial
Comin' from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead with my rhymes I'll trial
Cast you off into exile

To sweet to be sour to nice to be mean
With the tough guy style I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I'm going to plot and scheme
Mario see likes to keep it clean
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rappin', cause that's my dream

Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If I rap soup my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack DJ AD Rock!
If you try to knock me you'll get mopped

Your knees start shakin' and your fingers pop

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

[Chorus]
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

[Chorus]

Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed to do for you my baby

[Chorus: x3]

There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a goul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs

Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you want to see
It's you who's haunting me
You're warning me
To be the stranger
In your life

Am I amusing you
Or just confusing you
Am I the beast
You visualized
And if you want to see
Eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque
Before your eyes

Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where restless soul's spoke

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes

A haunting ghostly treat
The foolish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the light

But if you came to see
The truth the purity
It's here inside
A lonely heart

So let the performance start
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you
So tell me is it scary for you, baby
So tell me is it crazy for you, baby
Am I scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for ya

Masquerade the heart
Is the height of haunting souls
Just not what you seek of me
Can the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Am I scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
So tell me am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for ya, baby
Is is scary for ya, baby
Am I scary for you
(I don't want to talk about it)

Am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby

Don't tell me you want out of this
Don't say it's time for us to quit
Don't say goodbye, this can't be it
Baby please, 'cause it's not worth it

You came into my life
And it's so funny
How you made everything right
And now you're saying to me
Something ain't right
What did I do?
Did I hurt you?
Baby can you tell me
How to dry your eyes
But let me say
I never meant to make you cry
If anything I meant to
Be right by your side
How did I go wrong?
When my love was strong
And all I ever wanted was you

If I can ease the pain
Whatever it takes to
That is what I'll do
Why do you feel this way
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I am here for you

[Chorus: x2]
Don't tell me you want out of this
Don't say it's time for us to quit
Don't say goodbye, this can't be it
'Cause it's not worth it

You mean the world to me
And all I do is try to give you all of me
I never do anything that wouldn't be pleasing to you
I never knew that you were hurting
And I'll take the blame for anything that I've done
That has caused you pain
I never meant to hurt you in any way
So this day, I wanna say
Baby please forgive me

If I can ease the pain
Whatever it takes to
That is what I'll do
Why do you feel this way
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I am here for you

[Chorus]

Don't wanna see you this way
What must I do to make it all brand new
Let me take the pain away
Anything for you, 'cause baby I love you

[Chorus]

Too Late 
Too Late 
Too Late 
In this almighty cage 
We shop through the yellow page 
Gone is the corner store 
There is a supermarket there for you 

But feelings remain the same 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
Well it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late) 

It's a new day, a new age 
A photograph is taken, its ready one minute later 
Cars are bigger and better 
Manufacture satisfy
Any world full of crime 
I can't let you take

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late) 
No, no 

So you want to be a star 
I think you are 
You don't have to go further 
Then my loving arms 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 

Are you sure you want to go to New York City (New York City) 
Where girls make it big if their pretty (if their pretty) 
Let say you get that penthouse view 
But whose gonna love you the way I do (just the way I do) 

It's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
No, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yea, yea, yea 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
It's too late, too late to change the time 
Ooh, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yea, yea, yea 

Too late, too late

It's your thing

Do what you wanna do

Who to sock it to

It's your thing
(It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do

Who to sock it to

And if you want me to love you, maybe I will

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
You got me falling in love, got me falling in love

You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause 

No matter how it starts it ends the same
Someone's always doing someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
All night, all night

And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is saying come and do me

Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go falling again 

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry

So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
Back where I belong

Oh, I went out to do my thing
And I was totally rejected
I put you down for love unknown
But it wasn't what I expected

So frightened and confused
I came running back to you
I got right down on my knees
And said darling, won't you please

I don't know why you did it
But I'm not too proud to admit it, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong.

Adventure grabbed my heart
And took me away from you, honey
I met all kinds of pretty girls
In every town that I passed through

But that fiery senorita
Burned me down in Mexico
And I got kisses cold as ice
From my Alaskan Eskimo

I feel guilty and ashamed
But I'm gonna say it just the same, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, yeah
It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms

Now yes says senorita
She gave me I'll just si ya!
While kissing in the igloo
My Eskimo said no no!

Yeah, baby
So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
It's great to be here
It's great to be here in your arms
Baby, baby, baby, baby, ow!

It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms, yeah
It's great to be here in your arms
Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah

You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you

I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holdin' on (holdin' on)
Yes I will, yes I will

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, girl, is all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to protect you (yeah baby)
With unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you

I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holdin' on
Ooh ooh ooh
Yes I will (holdin' on, holdin' on)
Yes I will

If you should ever find someone new
I know he better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't
I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know baby I'll be there
I'll be there I'll be there

Just call my name, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Just look over your shoulders honey, ooh!
I'll be there, I'll be there,
Whenever you need me, I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know baby
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Oh oh oh oh I'll be there, I'll be there

Nation to nation, all the world must come together,
Face the problems that we see,
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later.
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears,
But we must live each day like it's the last.
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts,
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out.
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors,
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout.
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song.
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple,
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself.
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,

It ain't too much for me to jam.
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff, it ain't, don't you,
It ain't too much for me to

Jam, jam, here comes the man, hot damn,
The big boy stands, movin' up a hand.
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson,
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed.
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle, bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a bundle.
Execute the plan, first I cooled like a fan,
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael 'cause it ain't hard to

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.

Got To Give It
You Just Want To Give It

Free and untamed that's how I've grown
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
Oh your smile
But tell me, ain't your child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild

[Chorus]
I'm Johnny Raven by and by
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye

Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
But I'm home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel

[Chorus]

Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven yeah, yeah by and by
I'm gonna fly
When you cry part of me's gonna die

Give me some joyful jukebox music
And some genuine alligator shoes
Give me a Chevrolet car and a honky tonk bar
It's a rhythm that I can't refuse
Give me a quarter for that jukebox
So I can play my favorite song
Give me a touch of the past so we can bop so fast
And everybody sing along
(1st chorus)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Remember how to rock n' roll
Are you ready (are you ready)
Ready (are you ready)
To boogie down and lose control
Play that record again for me
The one with the rock n' roll melody
Just make me a believer in rock n' roll fever
And bring back the memories
(2nd chorus)
Remember when you saw the beatles
And heard the music of the rolling stones
Well baby we'll be rollin' in at seven in a make believe heaven
The good ol' days have aged my bones
(1st chorus)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Remember how to rock n' roll
Just make me a believer in rock n' roll fever
And bring back the memories, oh yeah
One more time
Give some joyful jukebox music
That gets me out on the dancin' floor
Give me a Saturday night to hold my baby tight
And watch me shake it up once more
(2nd chorus)

She's lookin' for a job and a finer place to stay,
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promising,
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive,
She works in a restaurant, night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away

She cries inside every time she feels this way,
And she's dying inside every time her baby cries, no

Keep your head up

Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
So give yourself
A chance

Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And, little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You gotta know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground

Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself no matter what it's gon' take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith

gon' keep it brother
You got it
And when you think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of when you're all alone
And you can go by feel
'stead of circumstance
But the power's in beliving
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you only try

So keep the faith, ow
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

I told my brother how to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride
Go for what you want, don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner,
But you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it brother
You got it
I know that keepin' the faith
Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has
To make it right
Makes it
Makes it right

Keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground
Keep the faith
Baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Better stand up and act like you wanna do right
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday
Go for what you want and don't forget the faith
Look at yourself and what you're doin' right now
Stand back a minute just to check yourself out
Straighten out your life and how you're livin' each day
Get yourself together, 'cause you got to keep the faith
Uh, uh, uh

Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Lift up your mind

Dust off your butt and get your self-respect back
You've known me long enough to know that I don't play
Take it like you want it but you got to keep the faith
Gon'

Just keep your eyes on the prize
And get your feet back on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea

Before your confidence will win out

Liberian girl
You came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl
You came and you changed my world
A feeling so true

Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says
"Do you love me"
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"

(Naku penda piya-naku taka piya-mpenziwe)

Liberian girl
You kiss me then,
Ooh, the world
You do this to me
Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says
"Do you love me"
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"

I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watchin' snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that waiting there is

Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a little prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(And I'm as sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you have to leave me)

Oh, little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'

Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, yeah baby
Say you will

Just give me another chance for a romance
Come on and tell me when do you return
'Cause everyday that you been gone away
You know my heart does nothin' but burn, cry

Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will, say you will
Come on, come on, say it right now baby

Come on, come on, say that you will
Come on, say it right now baby
Say that you will, come on, come on
Say that you will
Come on, come on, say that you will
Come on, come on, come on, say that you will

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there
You closed the door of your heart and turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked just one way
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh my darling, now you're gone

Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it

'Cause baby, every time I love you
It's in and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in out baby
'Cause baby, love never felt so good

Baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, driving me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good

Baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd doubt it was mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, driving me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good

This is just a little love song
From me to you
I just want to say I thank you
For loving me like you do
I'm so happy your the one song
Just to good to be true
Gonna dedicate this love song, this love song to you

Yesterday my empty heart had nothin' to do
But sit alone, and sanging the blues
Who ever think, I change my tunes
Well it was easy when I'm with you

I feel the rhythm of the love song
Love song
Sanging all day long
So take my hand, and we will dance the song
While the dance is on
(hey)

Yesterday my empty heart had nothin' to do
But sit alone, and sanging the blues
Who ever think, I change my tunes
Well it was easy when I'm with you

This is just a little love song
From me to you
I just want to say I thank you

For loving me like you do
Oh baby, when I feel the word I love you
Well you say it too.

I love you
I love you
Love song, love song

Oh, baby baby baby this is just a little love song.
From me to you
You just say you do
My little love song
My love song to you
Ooh ooh doo doo doo doo doo doo ooh

Love song, love song

Ah I feel a fountain in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart so sad 'cause love's gone bad

I see a rainbow all in black
Must be a sign that you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane

I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see? 
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me? 
Where's he tenderness to comfort me? 

Everytime some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart fells sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart fells bad

Black crows flying up above
It's a sign that I live life without love
Slime's on the man, slime's ont the sea
Slime's everywhere I said I'm destined to be

And this world where nothing's right
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool out of me
Heart feels sad, love's gone bad

Why don`t you believe me when I say that i love you? 
I`m crazy `bout you 
You wear the face that tells me you think my loving ain`t true 
I`m all about you 
You`re my desire 
I get higher every time I speak your name 
That`s all I do 
And the way that I can`t sleep at night 
Just proves what I go through 
I`m crazy `bout you 
 
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty, 
Gone with your bad self 
Now you say that I don`t love, when it`s giving my love pains 
It`s the hurt and the tension 
Girl, it`s driving me insane 
 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
 
Why don`t you believe me when I say that I am true 
I`m crazy `bout you 
I`m here to love and please you, I`ll do what you want me to 
I`m all about you 
Living and hoping, but I`m coping 
With these things you put me through 
That`s all I do 
The way that I can`t sleep at night 
Just proves what I go through 
I`m crazy `bout you 
 
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty, 
Gone with your bad self 
Now you say that I don`t love, when it`s giving my love pains 
It`s the hurt and the tension 
Girl, it`s driving me insane 
 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one

Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near

And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do (always on my mind)

Oh baby, now, I've been watchin' you, girl
When you dance, you steal the show
Just like you stole my heart
When the lights were low
All the guys are waiting
Pleading just to hold you tight
Oh, darling, no, no, no please not tonight

'Cause now you're in my arms, girl
You thrill my soul
C'mon, hold me close
Rock me slow
Baby, never let me go

[CHORUS]
Oh, baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy
Just gimme a try 
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby, I...)
Can satisfy you
Gonna 'lectrify you
C'mon, let me prove it
Show you I can do it

I've been walkin' like a shadow
Right behind you, by myself
While you've been walking home
With someone else
Don't you know it hurts me
Seeing you with other guys
Oh, darling, no, no, no please not tonight

When the party's over, let me walk you home
I'll hold you close
Rock you slow
Never, never let you go

Oh, baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy
Just gimme a try 
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby, I...)
Oh, all, all mine, mine, mine, mine, yeah 

Oh, baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy, yeah 
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby, I...)
Hey, what you say, girl?
Can we slip away, girl?
I want to get into you
Let me do it to you, oh

(Oh, baby, make tonight all mine)
(Oh, I've waited such a long, long time)
(Baby, I...)

You send cold chills
Up and down my spine
We kiss for thrills
Then you draw the line
Oh baby

'Cause your mama told you
That love ain't right
But don't you know
Good lovin' is the spice of life Yeah

Mama's pearl, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin'
Ooh, ooh, now baby
Goody girl, let down those curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Don't keep me wishing

(Bum, bum, bum, bum)
You want my lovin' yes you do, do, do
You know my lovin' is true, true, true
Now baby

But your conscience tells you

But just a little lovin' never hurt no one, oh

Mama's pearl, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin'

(Ooh, the rest is up to you)
(Here is what to do)
(Let yourself go)

Let yourself just oh now, now no

Let's fall in love, let's fall in love

Goody girl lay down your curls

Why don't you give my love a whirl (Girl, don't be afraid)

(Oh, we've got the first step made)

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
You can't close your, your mind!

(Then you close your, mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

Oh no, no no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good!
Chime on!
(Change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
I've got to make that change, today!
Hoo!
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not let yourself
Brother
Hoo!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know, I've got to get
That man, that man
(Man in the mirror)
You've got to move! Chime on!
Chime on!
You got to
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah! Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself, now!
(Man in the mirror)
You know it!
You know it!
You know it!
You know it
(Change)
Make that change

Oh baby yeah Maria

Oh Maria you sweet little sunflower 
Oh hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me Maria 
If you're on that lonely night 
What's my life without you girl 
I'm so lonely I'm so blue 
Without you darling my life is through 
Come on back

I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost and passed away
I felt my destiny were sad the rain
Going know her way

There's sound of the melody
I got song you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Make my heart keep turn
To the music got to love that filled my mind
Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me want to sing
For you only
Oh, oh
(I see you love me) 

The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
But when you lend my mind
Have an answer now love don't hold me
All the girls have brighten now
And the darkness is lighter now
Is my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye you today

Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me want to sing
For you only

Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know there's music to my ears
Every word that you say

Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me want to sing
For you only

Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right
For every win, someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

[Chorus]
Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)


[Chorus]

Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)


[Chorus]

Oh yeah
Nothing's better than family,
For the ones who love you so
Be a shoulder to cry on when you are in need
They will never leave you alone
When your friends bring you down
And they drag you through the dirt
And nobody is around
They will carry you through the hurt

Just remember that family comes first
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first

I can see you crying someone broke your heart,
Instead of being with those who love you,
You spend time apart, it's because you think
They won't understand
The pain you're going through, So you don't reach out your
Hand for them, 'til they'll pull and reach for you.

Just remember that family comes first
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first

Don't you be ashamed of your family, put you into this earth,
And that's what its worth unconditionally, sometimes you may
Disagree and wont see eye to eye
Don't you run away they will be right by your side
Oh oh

Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Comes first

It's fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine
It's alright

I had a dream last night
That the world stopped turning
But your madness, it kept on
Guess I wasn't too bright
And I really wasn't learning
Should have seen it all along

All those sweet (sweet) sweet kisses (yeah)
And those sweet (sweet) red roses (yeah)
They convinced me it was you
I made you (you) exclusive (yeah)
Now it's so (now it's conclusive that) conclusive
That you wasn't doin' it too

[Chorus]
If ya told me from the start
That you played around, I woulda been fine
Then I woulda played too
And I guess I woulda had a good time
If ya told me from the start
That you played around, I woulda been fine
Then I woulda played too
And I guess I woulda had a good time

Something didn't feel right
And I wish I knew it
I just could not see your games
I got respect for you
And you put me through it
Why would you bring me so much pain

I would stick up for you
'Cause I did (I did adore you) adore you
While my dogs would chew you out
Tried to be so nice
On those lonely 
(On those lonely lonely lonely nights) nights
But I should have figured you out

[Chorus]

Baby you're so fine
(You are the one that I love)
You are so fine
(Your love was sent from above)
You are so, you're fine, fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine)
You are so fine
Fine (your love was sent from above)
Oh you're all of mine
You're fine, fine, fine, fine, 
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine)
Fine (you are the one that I love)
Fine (your love was sent from above)
You're fine, fine, fine, fine
Fine, five, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine)

[Chorus]

Hey baby 
I'm looking for you 
Drifting on a memory 
Ain't no place I'd rather be 
Than with you, loving you 
Day will make a way for night 
All we'll need is candlelight 
And a song soft and long, well 

Glad to be here alone 
With a lover unlike no other 
Safe to see a new horizon 
Slowly coming into view 

[Chorus] 
I want to be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Lovely as a ray of sun 
That touches me when the morning comes 
Feels good to me, my love and me 
Smoother than a gentle breeze 
Flowing through my mind with ease 
Soft as can be well when you're loving me 

Love to be 
Riding the waves of your love 
Enchanted with your touch 
It seems to me 
We can sail together in and out of mystery 

[Chorus] 

Paradise I have within 
Can't feel insecure again 
You're the key and this I see 
Now and then I lose my way 
Using words to try and say 
What I feel yeah love is real ooh 
I might as well 
Sign my name on a card 
Which could say it better 
Time will tell 
Cause it seems that I've done 
Just about all that I can do do do 

[Chorus]

Remember when 
It all began 
We were all in love 
Then came the friends 
Telling you when
Your time for me was good enough 
I constantly
Had to compete 
With your crew and their schemes 
Remembering 
Back in the day
I used to mean everything

(If we could just get it back)
To the way it used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact 
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back

Now tell me why 
So many nights 
You had so much to do 
When you said bye 
Sometimes I tried
I tried to make you choose 
Now tell me how
You can allow
You boys to control
The time we shared 
It was unfair 
But now you need to know

(Now if I told you) 
That I'm moving on 
(Boy what would you do) 
Things just ain't the same 
(We were supposed to) 
Conquer everything yeah 
(Boy let me tell you)
You've got to make a change

(If we could just get it back)
To the way it used to be 
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back

(If we could just get it back)
To the way it used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back

I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all
 
I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all
 
And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight, my Lord
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas right now

Have yourself a merry little Christmas, have yourself a merry Christmas now
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Ooh, here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough, ooh, oh
And have yourself, let your heart be light, ooh
Have yourself, put your troubles out of sight, ooh
Just have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry Christmas, a merry merry Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, merry, merry, merry, merry, merry, merry, ooh
Have yourself a merry Christmas, merry little Christmas
Have your self, have yourself, a merry little Christmas
Have your self, have yourself, a merry Christmas now
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

He's all over me
And He's keeping me alive
He's all over me
And He's keeping me alive

He's all over me
And He's keeping me alive
I know He is keeping me alive
He's keeping me alive

(He's all over me) He's all over me

And He's keeping me alive (and He's keeping me alive)
I know He is keeping me alive
He's keeping me alive

(He's in my hands, He's in my feet) He's in my hand and my feet
(I can hardly keep my seat) I can't keep my seat
(He's in my spirit and my soul) in my spirit and my soul
(I'll never grow old) I won't never grow old
(He's in my heart, He's in my mind) in my heart, in my mind
(I'm glad that He's mine) I'm so glad He's mine 

(He's all over me) He's all over me
(And He's keeping me alive) and He's keeping me alive
(He's all over me) He's all over me
(And He's keeping me alive) I know, I know, I know

I know he is keeping me alive
He's keeping me alive

Like the Hebrew boys
Thrown in the fiery furnace
Everybody thought it was over for them
But the Lord brought them out on time

You said you'd be here by nine 
Instead you took your time 
You didn't think to call me boy 
Here I sit trying not to cry 
Asking myself why 
You'd do this to me

Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say: 

All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me

Now I see that you've been doing wrong 
You played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby 
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out 
That you were cheating on me 
How could you do it to me

Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say: 

All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me

I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna take it no more 
I ain't gonna take it no more 
I ain't gonna take it no more 

Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
Tell me what it is and I will be alright

[VERSE 1]
Think about it
There must be higher love
Down in the heart or
Hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart,
I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We will walk the line 
And try to see
Falling behind in what could be

[CHORUS]
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love
I keep thinking of

[VERSE 2]
Worlds are turning 
And we're just hanging on
Facing our fear
And standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone
Who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We will walk the line 
And try to see
Falling behind in what could be

[CHORUS]
[BRIDGE]
I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
I could light the night up
With my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine
From pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

[CHORUS]

I hold you, I touch you
Make you my woman
I'll give you my love
With sweet surrender
Tonight our hearts will beat as one
And I'll hold you, I'll touch you
Make you my woman tonight

There's something in your eyes I see
A pure and simple honesty

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

I believe you
When you say that you love me
Know that I won't take you for granted
Tonight the magic has begun
So won't you hold me touch me
Make me a woman tonight

There's something in your eyes I see
I won't betray your trust in me

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

I'll hold you (hold)
And touch you (touch me, baby)
Make you my woman (make me a woman)
Tonight

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

Hold up the light
Save the world from darkness
Hold up the light
Won't you please America

It's time for all of us
Who claim in God we trust
To take a stand
Let our voice be heard
Across the nation
To every man

If we are the light
It's time for all of us to fight
For what is right
We must work while it is day
Before the fall of night

Voices crying, young people dying
Lost, nowhere to run
So I'm asking, takes sacrificing
Time for us to come and
Hold up the light

Hold up the light
Save the world from darkness
Hold up the light
Won't you please America

Boys and girls
Can't you see
The kind of friend
Crack can be

Voices crying, young people dying
Lost, nowhere to run

So I'm asking, takes sacrificing
Time for us to come and
Hold up the light

Hold up the light
Save the world from darkness
Hold up the light
Won't you please America

When you're down and in despair
Don't be uneasy because he'll be there
Say don't you worry, no don't you fret
The Lord has never, never failed you yet

So hold on, help is on the way
Hold on, God is on his way
Hey hold on he's on his way
He told me to hold on
He's on his way
Hold on he's coming soon
Pray, he'll be there
C'mon now, yeah

Now when it seems that you can't stand
Just hold on to God's unchanging hand
Yeah, weeping may, yes, endure for just one night,
But joy will come in the morning light

Hold on he's on his way
Come on hold on
See I've tried it and I know
Help is on the way
Hold on, hold on
I'm begging cause I know
He's on his way

He may not come when you want him
But he's right on time
But he'll be right there (on time)

Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way yeah
The word told me
If I ask he's on his way
I'm thankful cause I know he is

Come on just say, help
Come on just try, help
Ask him for a little bit, help
He'll give it to you right away, help
Help, Believe he's on his way now, help
Help, Know the help I know, help
I've called him before, help
He said his help on his way, help
Help is on the way
So glad to know hey
Woo

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mmm-hmm
Oh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love

Ooh, how will I know (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (love can be deceiving)
How will I know

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now, uh-huh
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love

Ooh, tell me how will I know (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (love can be deceiving)
How will I know

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
Ooh, if he loves me not
Hey, if he loves me
If he loves me not

Oh, how will I know, how will I know
How will I know
Hey, how will I know

Ooh, how will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

How will I know (how will I know)
How will I know
How will I know (I say a prayer)
How will I know
Ooh, how will I know (I fall in love)
How will I love, hey, how will I know?

I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
As far as I can see
You will always be
The one for me
Oh yes you will

I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down
I will always be around
Just to be right there where you are my love
Oh I love you boy

I will never leave you out
I will always let you in
To places no one's ever been
Deep inside can't you see
I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I would play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
Love's a miracle
And baby you're a dream come true
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me
I was lost now I'm free girl
I believe in you and me

You are the flame in my heart 
You light my way in the dark 
You are the ultimate star 
You lift me from up above 
Your unconditional love 
Takes me to paradise 
I belong to you 
And you 
You belong to me too 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 
You make me feel so divine 
Your soul and mind are entwined 
Before you I was blind 
But since I've opened my eyes 
And with you there's no disguise 
So I could open up my mind 
I always loved you from the start 
But I could not figure out 
That I had to do it everyday 
So I put away the fight 
Now I'm gonna live my life 
Giving you the most in every way 
I belong to you 
And you 
You belong to me too 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 
Oh I belong to you 
I belong to you 
And you, you 
You belong to me too 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 
Oh I belong to you 
I belong to you 
And you, you 
You belong to me too 
You make my life complete 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 
Oh I belong to you 
I belong to you 
And you, and you 
You belong to me too 
You make my life complete 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet

Tired of playing this game 
And I won't play it no more 
And I won't take it no more 
Through with being your fool 
And I won't do it no more 
And I won't, I won't keep up this act 
Not for one minute 
I'm gonna pull, I'm gonna pull this curtain down 

[Chorus]
This time I won't play this game 
I made a vow to make a change 
And I bow out 
I won't be hanging around, baby 
I decline to take the pain 
And I resign the masquerade 
And I bow out 
I won't be staying around, baby 
I bow out 

Can't go on with the show 
You're just a stage I went through 
Now you're just fading from view, yeah baby 
It's time for a change of scene 
Guess I'll be taking my leave 
I guess I won't, I won't stay in this play 
Not for one minute 
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make my exit now 
Oh baby 

[Chorus]

When you're left standing on that stage all alone 
Maybe you will realize 
You should of learned to treat me right 
And when this final act is finally through 
Maybe you'll wish you'd been 
The kind of man you should have been 
Now watch me say goodbye 
And walk right out of your life 
Oh baby, all right babe 

[Chorus: x2]

Lost touch with my soul
I had no where to turn
I had no where to go
Lost sight of my dream,

Thought it would be the end of me
I thought I'd never make it through
I had no hope to hold on to,
I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain

I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up

Hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

Found hope in my heart,
I found the light to life
My way out the dark
Found all that I need
Here inside of me

I thought I'd never find my way
I thought I'd never lift that weight
I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain

I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up

Hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

There were so many times I
Wondered how I'd get through the night I
Thought took all I could take

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain

I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up

Hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

I was not built to break
I got to know my own strength

Where do I go when there's nobody else to turn to?
Who do I talk to when nobody wants to listen?
Who do I lean on when there's no foundation stable?

I go to the rock
I know he's able
I go to the rock

I go to the rock for my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me

When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock

Where do I go, where do I go
When the storms of life are threatening?
Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow?
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation?

I go to the rock
I know He's able
I go to the rock

I know He's the rock for my salvation
I know He's the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me

When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock

I know He's the rock for my salvation
I know He's the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me

When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock

I go to the rock
I go to the rock
I go to the rock
I go to the rock

You can go to the rock
You can go to the rock
You can go to the rock
You can go to the rock

I go to the rock
I go to the rock
I go to the rock
I go to the rock

I go to the rock
I go to the rock
I go to the rock
I go to the rock

When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock

When your love is strong and it comes from the heart
Ain't no man strong enough ain't no time long enough to tear it apart
And that's what we had believe it or not
So on the final day I thought all the hurting pain will end up on top

So I won't cry 'cause you're going away
'Cause the chemistry we've got it don't fade
I won't be wishing for better days
'Cause deep inside I know our love stays the same

You got to know

[Chorus]
No matter where you are (you got me)
Baby near or far (you got me)
Our love will never fade (you got me)
So let me hear you say it
Baby I got you... I'll be there I'll be there (no matter what)
Baby I got you... I'll be there I'll be there (no matter what)
'Cause I got you baby

I never lie
'Cause you are the reason that my heart is beating that I am alive
Before you go... look in my eyes
You can't be replaced (no)
I'm down to wait... The rest of my life

You got to know

[Chorus]

I'll hold you up... when you just can't stand
I'll make you fly... when you think that you can't
By my side forever... baby that's the plan
I'll be your everything... I'll be your everything

I got you...

[Chorus]

Say you want me I want you baby
Say you love me I need you baby
I got you baby you got me
I'll be there for you
I love you baby I love you darling

Say you will be there...

Share my life
Take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you

Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love

I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to?

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
No, don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh, oh

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally 
Perfect situations must go wrong 
But this has never yet prevented me 
From wanting far too much for far too long 
Looking back, I could have done it differently 
Won a few more moments, who can tell? 
But it took time to understand the man 
Now at least I know, I know him well 

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 

No one in your life is with you constantly 
No one is completely on your side 
And though I move my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide 
Looking back, I could have played it differently 
Learned about the man before I fell 
But I was ever so much younger then 

Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine) 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 

Didn't I know how it would go 
If I knew from the start 
Why am I falling apart 

Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 
It took some to understand him 
Hoo ooh I know him so well

Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart
One more time, oh, no no

Did you think I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there
Did you think you could walk back
In my life, oh

So you found you missed the love you threw away
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye

Would a sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing on my mind

Now you say you're sorry and you've
Changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

So when all you've got are sleepless night
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you
Who said goodbye, who said goodbye

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

I learned from the best
I learned from you

As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to

I look to you
I look to you

After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you

Yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song

I look to you

After losing my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you
I look to you

Yeah

And when all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you

Oh yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song

I look to you

(my levies have broken, my walls have come)

Coming down on me

(crumbling down on me)

All the rain is falling

(the rain is falling, defeat is calling)

Set me free

(I need you to set me free)

Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me

I look to you
I look to you

After all my strength has gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song

I look to you

Yeah

I look to you
Yeah
I look to you

I love the the Lord
He heard my cry 
And pitied every groan
Long as I, I live 
And troubles rise
I hasten to his throne 

Oh, I love the Lord (I love the Lord)
I sure do, surely do love the Lord 
He heard, he heard my cry (he heard my cry)
And pitied every groan, yes he did (and pitied every groan)
Every groan 
Long as I live, long as I, I live (long as I live)
And troubles rise, troubles rise (and troubles rise)
I hasten to to to to to (I'll hasten to)
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne (his throne)
(I'll hasten to his throne) hold on hold on 
Tears are streaming down my eyes 
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne (I'll hasten to his throne)

Yes I will, I'll run (I'll hasten to)
I know I can go to his throne (his throne)
I know I can go, I know I can go 
I'll hasten, I'm gonna run (I'll hasten to his throne)
I know I can go, I know I can go 
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne (I'll hasten to his throne)

See I can run, Lord you know I will 
When there is nowhere to go I know I can go to you (I'll hasten to his throne)
I know I can run to you oh 
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his, his throne (I'll hasten to his throne)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'll hasten, hasten to his throne (I'll hasten to his throne)
Surely gonna be here

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody oo Somebody oo
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody oo Somebody oo
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me

And presents under the tree, oh
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams

If only in my dreams

Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally

Who's to say it's easy 
Sometimes life's not fair

Just knock the door will open 
And when it does 
You'll find love standing there 
And if it's true I'm knockin' 
Come open up the door 
My heart's been right here waiting 
For someone to adore 
Well if it's true, I'm knockin' 
Come open up the door 
My heart's been right here waiting 
For someone to adore 
Say if it's true 
In sight we have two choices 
And it's told me to do or die 
And every word he speaks makes me certain 
Beyond the door's life's reason why 
And if it's true I'm knockin' 
Come open up the door 
My heart's been right here waiting 
For someone to adore 
Well if it's true, I'm knockin'

Waste of (my) time

Share my life,
Take me for what I am.
'Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you.

Take my love,
I'll never ask for too much,
Just all that you are
And everything that you do.

I don't really need to look
Very much further/farther,
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow.
I will hold it back again,
This passion inside.
Can't run from myself,
There's nowhere to hide.
(Your love I'll remember forever.)

Don't make me close one more door,
I don't want to hurt anymore.
Stay in my arms if you dare,
Or must I imagine you there.
Don't walk away from me.
(No, don't walk away from me. Don't you dare walk away from me.)
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you (you, you, you. If I don't have you, oh, oh)

You see through,
Right to the heart of me.
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love.

I never knew
Love like I've known it with you.
Will a memory survive,
One I can hold on to?

I don't really need to look
Very much further/farther,
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow.
I will hold it back again,
This passion inside.
Can't run from myself,
There's nowhere to hide.
(Your love I'll remember forever.)

Don't make me close one more door,
I don't want to hurt anymore.
Stay in my arms if you dare,
Or must I imagine you there.
Don't walk away from me.
(No, don't walk away from me. Don't you dare walk away from me.)
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you (you, you, you. If I don't have you, oh, oh)

Don't make me close one more door,
I don't want to hurt anymore.
Stay in my arms if you dare,
Or must I imagine you there.
Don't walk away from me.
(No, don't walk away from me. Don't you dare walk away from me.)
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you (you, you, you. If I don't have you, oh, oh)

Now tell me how you'd feel
If I told you that I 
Have feelings for you 
And would it be so wrong to say 
What's on my mind 
I'm sorry I have to
We were friends but with time 
What I feel inside for you has changed 
But I'd give up on love
If I thought that it was untrue for you

If I told you that
I wanted to see you 
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you 
If I told you that
I'll always keep you 
What would you say
If I told you that

I know that we're just friends 
But what if I decide to bring something in 
I hope it won't offend the trust 
We have cause I don't want this to end
If you think that we'll lose what we have 
Then I'd just rather stay (rather stay) the same 
(I'd rather stay the same) 
'Cause I don't want to choose 
Between two of the most precious things to me 
(Tell me)

If I told you that
I wanted to see you 
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you 
If I told you that
I'll always keep you 
What would you say
If I told you that

If we take this chance
And extend to each other romance 
I hope it would be 
The right thing for you and me

If I told you that
I wanted to see you 
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you 
If I told you that
I'll always keep you 
What would you say
If I told you that

Would you be there for me 
Could you dare to hold me 
Will my feelings leave me 
Lonely if I told you

If I told you that
I wanted to see you 
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you 
If I told you that
I'll always keep you 
What would you say
If I told you that

If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking at you.
And if you could only see yourself,
You'd feel the same way too.

You could say that I am a dreamer
Who's had a dream come true.
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking at you.

If you're wondering why I'm smiling,
It's because I'm happy with you.
And the warm sensations touch my heart,
And fill me through and through.

I could hold you close forever,
And never let you go.
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because I just love you so.

Now my heart is an open door;
Won't you come inside for more?
You can love so sweetly now;
Take my love, take me completely now.

Oh... if you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking for you.
And my eyes adjust the window
For my feelings to come through.

And by far, you are more beautiful
Than anything I ever knew
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because (it's because) they're looking at you.

Baby why I get so many people telling me 
They seen you up in the mall 
Are they mistaking 
All up on some chick 
As though I don't exist 
What is this

Why they all in my business 
It's just too ridiculous 
I can't get no sleep 
They just keep warning me 
Should I believe it 
They say I don't need it 
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind

Honey too many people say you're faking me 
They ask what have you done lately 
They say we won't last
They're predicting that it's over, it's over

Why they all in my business 
It's just too ridiculous 
I can't get no sleep 
They just keep warning me 
Should I believe it 
They say I don't need it 
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind

Too many girls they dislike me 
Since I got you 
They wanna fight me 
'Cause I'm the chick walking around 
With the ring 
Tell me why these hoes they don't even like me

Why they all in my business 
It's just too ridiculous 
I can't get no sleep 
They just keep warning me 
Should I believe it 
They say I don't need it 
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind

Oh boy it's all the love that you're giving 
They mind 'cause love is what they're missing 
That's why they stay up in my business

Nobody does it better
(Sing it, baby)
Makes me feel sorry for the past
(I know they feel sorry too)

Nobody does it quite the way you do
Bobby, you're the best
(Thank you, baby, thank you)
(Yes, you are, yes, you are)
(I love you, baby)

Laid back
(Sing)
You know you are
(Baby, sing, yeah)
Oh, you know you are
(Baby, sing, yeah)

You the best, baby, you the best, baby
(Are you ready? You think they ready?)
(You think they ready, baby?)
Get 'em, baby
(Think they ready?)
Get 'em, baby, get'em, baby
Go, baby, go

Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out
But you came home around three
If six of y'all went out
Then four of you were really cheap
Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

[Chorus]
It's not right 
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right 
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you 
Leave your key 
I'd rather be alone 
Than unhappy

I'll pack your bags
So you can leave town for a week
The phone rings
And then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends 
Down on 54th St.
So why did 213
Show up on your Caller I.D.

I've been through all of this before 
So how could you think
That I would stand around
And take some more
Things are gonna change
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more fears and tears
For you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out
You were making a fool of me

[Chorus: x5]

Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so
Jesus loves me this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to him belong
They are weak but he is strong

Yes Jesus loves me
Oh, yes Jesus loves me
Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so

Pressing on the up away
Always guide me Lord I pray
Undeserving, and stubbornly never fail to love me still

Yes Jesus loves me
Oh yes Jesus loves me
Oh yes Jesus loves me, for the Bible tells me so
Yes Jesus loves me, love
Oh yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so
For the Bible tells me so

(Feels so good to know) that I'm never alone
See, sometimes I'm lonely but never alone
For the Bible tells, for the Bible tells
For the Bible tells me so

See I know that he loves me
Whether I'm right, whether I'm wrong

Joy, joy, God's great joy
Joy, joy, down in my soul
Sweet, beautiful, soul saving joy
Oh, joy, joy in my soul

Joy, joy, God's great joy
Joy, joy, down in my soul
Oh, sweet, beautiful, soul saving joy
Oh, joy, joy in my soul

Early in the morning, before the break of day
I asked the Lord to make me whole
He holds me and the Lord keeps me
Oh, joy, joy in my soul

Listen, when I get weak and I can't go on
Thank you, Jesus, I feel all my hope, all my joy is gone
Late in the midnight hour I talk to my God
And He gives me joy, joy in my soul, thank you Jesus

(One of these all mornings), one of these all mornings it won't be very long
You just might look for me, but I'm going on home
(Listen, listen) I'm going up to glory (oh yes, I am) where I'm gonna sing and shout
Oh joy, (oh joy) joy in my soul

Can y'all help me sing joy
(Joy, joy) God's great joy
Sing it like you mean it
(Joy, joy) down in my soul (down in my soul)
It is sweet, beautiful, soul saving joy
(Oh, joy) joy in my soul
(Oh joy) joy in my soul

(Oh, joy) joy, in my soul

Oh, joy (oh, joy)

Yes, He is, you know what else He is?
The lily of the valley (the lily of the valley, joy)
Thank you, Jesus, listen, Alpha and Omega, joy (Alpha and Omega, joy)
Listen, in the midnight hour (in the midnight hour, joy)
You know He does, He gives me strength and power (He gives me strength and power, joy)
Listen what I like, listen, no food on the table (no food on the table, joy)
Thank You, Jesus, I know that He is able (I know that He is able, joy)
And you know I can't find the word to say, you what I say, hey hey hey (hey hey hey, joy)
Hey hey hey, joy
Oh, joy (oh, joy)

Do you have that joy? Do you have that joy?
The Master's joy (the Master's joy)
My Savior's joy (my Savior's joy)
The lily of the valley (the lily of the valley, joy)
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?
Can I have some joy? Oh, joy, (oh joy) joy in my soul

Yeah 
It's the second time around 
For you and I boy 
And believe me it's confusing me 
I'm afraid to say "let's make up" and "All's forgiven" 
But somethin' tells me it's heading for heartbreak 
So darling please I'm praying that 
This time yeah this time will be different 
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize 

[Chorus]
Tell me are you really ready for love boy 
Or is it just the lonely talking again 
Are you really ready for love boy 
Or is it the lonely talking again

Now the time before 
When we got together 
You promised you'd be forever true to me 
But all I got from you 
Was lots and lots of talking 
Lonely nights filled with misery 

So baby please please tell me now 
That when I fulfill your needs 
You won't up and leave me 
Even though you know 
I'll let you come back 

[Chorus]

Really need to know

With a positive mind

Contact Contact
Huh huh huh huh hoo huh yeah
You've been avoiding me
Like a cat trying to dodge a dog
I never see ya shine
You're as cold as the London fog
You claim you want my love
Well I wouldn't know by the way you behave
If you want to feel the thrill of my touch
You better come out of your cave

It's so perplexing
Why you fight it won't you try it
Love's electric
Turn me on and see

Love is a contact sport
You gotta move in time
If you want to do it right
Here I am
Love is a contact sport
You gotta act untamed
If you want to play the game
So grab my hand, SLAM!

I hate to sound aggressive
But I'm tired of waiting for your move
Cut the formalities
Cause you've got a few things to prove
If you really want my love
I need to feel it down deep from within
Don't make me wait too long
I'm ready now come and stroke my skin

Well all this talking
Worthless chatter just don't matter
Time for stalkin'
Come get next to me

Love is a contact sport
You gotta move in time
If you want to do it right
Here I am
Love is a contact sport
You gotta act untamed

Love is a contact sport
You gotta act untamed
If you want to play the game
So grab my hand, SLAM!

Ah, ah, ah
Things just ain't the way that they used to be
Back in the day when a man meant security
He'd be working hard all week
Baby kick back and throw up your feet
Let me fix you a treat
So it might be love and sweet

But he's worth it
He deserves it
May not be perfect
But he's all the man I need
He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling, ah
And whenever we're together
I know where I belong

[Chorus]
It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always always there)
Don't you love that man (I know)

Things they ain't the way they used to be
When a woman and a man work hard to be
Happy in love and stand together ooh
(Let's stay that way forever)

Never give in to a fight
Just trying work it out
Never give up on him
That's not what love's about
Stay true to your feelings
And remember
All the things he's done for you

[Chorus]

You'd better know I'm talking about that old-school love
That everlasting feeling can never be too much
Somebody loves you heart and soul
Hold on, don't stop
And never let him go

[Chorus]

Each time I pray
I search for words that say all that I'm going through

Here's what to say each time you pray
I give it all to you
How can I know what's real

Oh trust in yourself believe in what you feel

I don't understand what's the Master plan
Will it ever come together?
Yes love will find the way
Open up your heart
Give the greater part

And it will
Yes it will
Oh Yes it will
Love will find a way

Its all a part of youth
Searching for the truth
Seeing the way roads will lead you

Now I realize though problems may arise
There's someone I can come to

Time waits for no man
Don't give up
It's time to take a stand

I don't understand what's the Master plan
Will it ever come together?
Yes love will find the way
Open up your heart
Give the greater part
And it will
Yes it will

Love will find the way

In the middle of the night
Love will lead you to the light
You can win {Oh yes you can}
Just hold on
Don't give up the fight (Don't give up the fight)
Love will make things right

You can win
You can win
You can win
You can win
You can win

Now I understand {I know that}
Love will find the way

Open up your heart
Give the greater part
And it will come together
Love will find a way
Now I understand
This is the master plan

Yes it is
Yes it is

Love will find a way

I do believe
I do I do I do I do

Now you know love will find a way
Love will find a way

I know it will
Just believe it
I do believe it

Love will find a way

Hey yeah baby hoo boy 
yeah oh baby 
I hope you realize baby 
Just what you mean to me (uh) 
Hey you where I run for cover 
Your love is shelter for me 
And when I find myself needing 
Some lifting up 
One night with you and 
That always is enough 
How you make being in love 
A true rare affair 
So take me I'm your prisoner 

[Chorus] 
Will you sentence me 
To be your lover for life 
Your lover for life 
Will you sentence me 
I want to be your lover for life 
Your lover for life 
Your lover yeah yeah yeah 
I just want to hear you say 
You'll be my lover, lover for life 
Capture, there's no getaway 
You're my lover, my lover for life 

Under your spell or 
Under my own power 
It really doesn't matter to me 
No boy 
See I fell in love 
The first time I saw you 
And have been falling in love 
Ever since mm boy 

You heard my testimony 
You've seen my evidence 
Hey, it's a crime of passion 
In every sense 
And justice would be served 
If you stay here in my world 
So take me I'm your prisoner 

[Chorus] 

I'm your prisoner 
Take me 
I'm your prisoner 
And sentence me to be 
Your lover for life 
want to be 
Take me baby 
Your lover, your baby

I know, I cannot leave this place for the memories,
Things like they way they knew us all over town
We used to walk the streets together,
We could be seen,

Past shops where people knew us,
Yeah, people knew.
I've got to choose between tomorrow and yesterday,
Can't stop to think about my life, here today.

Memories can hang you up and haunt you,
All your life, you know,
Get so you cannot stay,
And yet cannot go.

Hey, I could find out where you've gone today,
I feel so unhappy,
Streets seem so empty now,
I want you, I want you with me,

Maybe I'll find someone to get you
Off my mind
Take me away from here and leave it, leave it all behind
Oh, Memories can hang you up and haunt you

All your life you know
Get so you cannot stay and yet cannot go

Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh

Came in the door
Checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for
Is staring in my face

They played our song
We hit the floor
He held me strong
And we danced the night away

I can see the way that he is making feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
If you go left right up down
Make you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

It's been a long long time
Since I fell, fell
Love has found my way oh oh oh
I've been looking (looking)
I've been searching (searching)
For the man to touch this place, oh ooh oh yeah

Can't deny the way that he is making feel
This way about his love
I've been searching for something like this
I'm saying oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If you feel good
If you're feeling good
Put one hand in the air, say yeah
If you feel good
If you're feeling good
It's 'cause love is in the air
Love is in the air

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

Come on and say...

Come on and say...

How could I throw away a miracle 
How could I face another day 
It's all of my doing 
I made a choice 
And today I pay 
My heart is full of pain 
How could you understand 
The way I feel 
How could you relate to so much pain 
Seems as though nothing can comfort me 
So today I pray 
That someone should listen for 

[Chorus] 
Nothing should matter 
Not when love grows inside you 
The choice is yours 
There's a miracle in store 
Nothing should matter 
Not when love grows inside you 
A voice of love is crying out 
Don't throw love away 
There's a miracle in store 

How could I let go of a miracle 
Nothing could ever take its place 
Thought I was looking 
Out for myself 
Now it seems the pain 
Is all that I have gained 
I wonder if I could be your miracle 
I wonder if I could spare you pain 
Seems as though nothing will comfort me 
Less today I pray 
That you should come listen 

[Chorus] 

Don't ever throw away your miracle 
Don't let it slip away 
Nothing should matter 

[Chorus]

We've been playing games with our emotions
Let's get what we feel out in the open
Wanting you is all I do
Boy I know you want me too
Don't you think it's time we proved
What we've been feeling

[Chorus]
This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
Cause oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth

Far too many times a heart gets broken
Just because three words are never spoken
We can't let that bother us
Not when we're so much in love
I could never get enough of saying I love you

[Chorus]

Wanting you is all I do
Boy, I know you want me, too
Don't you think it's time we proved
What we've been feeling

[Chorus]

Who would've thought of it
That I might feel like this
Some kind of wonderful 
There's nothing quite comparable

The thing about it is
It's oh so innocent
I wasn't looking for 
It came knockin' at my door

I'm trying to do things right 
But I'm about to lose this fight
'Cause spending time with you
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth

And every day with you
I swear it brings me closer 
To my only reservation is you 
My sweet temptation, baby.

[Chorus]
Oh, my heart is calling 
I'm falling for you
Oh, my heart is calling 
I'm falling for you

Who could imagine it
I found my happiness
In someone I barely know
And I like to take it slow

But you're so different, boy
You're breaking all my rules
What is it in your smile
That makes me feel the way I do 

I'm trying to live my life 
And I'm trying to live it right
If I desire you
It ain't because I'm trying to 

Boy, everyday with you
I swear it brings me closer to 
My only reservation is you, 
My sweet temptation, baby

[Chorus]

I've given it consideration (uh huh)
And it all adds up to you
I won't deny this heart is calling for you, baby
I've given it a lot of thought (uh huh)
And it all ends up on you
My sweet temptation
God knows I'm falling for you

[Chorus]

Is is in your smile, boy
Is it touch, baby
I don't know why...

My love
Some girl just want to spend guys money
Live their lives chasing the milk or honey
Silver lives are their fantasy
But you're lucky cause that ain't me

Most girls think guys are all the same
Not you so I can take the blame
I love you through the joy and pain
Even the coldest Georgia rain

[Chorus]
See my love is like a open sky
See my heart is like the river wide
No my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E
(My love, my love, my)

Some think that love is just a word
Because of all the things they've heard
They think they're gotta close their hearts
Can't see the light, the soul in the dark
But I know I got a real good man
Who loves me the best as he can
That's why I'm here faithfully
'Cause you'll do the same for me

[Chorus]

You gotta go through
The fire (the pain)
The rain (the joy)
Take the joy and do it in pain
(Never give in)
Give in
Don't give up
(Don't give up)
We can try but it will never never break my love

Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
See my love

[Chorus]

One night not long ago
I fell for you 
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past 
One of the few
You said it didn't last 

Now Romeo you know I can't believe 
Your tongue would slip so easily 
I know you think I oughta let it be 
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me 

[Chorus] 
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say 
If you still need her
Then be on your way 
Don't want to hear about Susan
She's got nothin' on me 
So show some respect for the love you receive 
My name is not Susan 
(No, no, no, no, no, get it right) 

Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream 
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace 
I froze in place
Never to be the same 

Now Romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily 
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time 
Say good-bye to me boy 

[Chorus] 

I never want to be the girly that you "call" one and only 
You know the kind of girly that you would call when you get lonely 
I never should have let you in, 
A damn shame, forgot my name! 
Well, anyway 

[Chorus] 

Don't want to hear about Susan 
My name ain't Susan
My name ain't Susan
My name ain't Susan
Ya better get it right!

Till you get it right, tell 'em you will never quit
Tell 'em you will never quit until they day you get it right, 
Till you get it right, hold your hand to the sky
Look 'em right in the eye, tell 'em you will never quit
Until the day you get it right
Till you get it right
Tell 'em you will never quit, until the day you get it right
Till you get it right, hold your hand to the sky
Look 'em right in the eye, tell 'em you will never quit
Until the day you get it right

Single mother, two jobs, workin' her fingers to the bone
Putting her daughters mouth before her own
She's gotta do it, but she's still feeling
Like there's something deep inside that she can't leave behind

She won't let go of it, no matter how many times
She hears it over with, it's all fixed in her mind
That it's gonna get better and she won't ever
Hang her head again, break a sweat again, never again

[Chorus]
Never, never give up, never, never give up, 
No matter how many times, somebody tells you it ain't working
Never, never give up, never, never give up, 
Hold your head tot he sky, look them right in the eyes
Tell you will never quit until the day you get it right
Never, never give up, never, never give up, 
Even though some days you'll have to cry, 
Shake it off and know that everything will be alright
As long as you never, never give up, never, never give up.

College student, paying her own way, 
Working the club at night
Look what she go through, to stay in law school
So maybe one day, she can make her way in a man's world
And never be called just another girl

It ain't nothing like a dream you can't see
Even when the people round you don't believe
But in the twelfth round, when you're against the ropes, 
Here comes your last minute miracle, 
You've got to know to

[Chorus]

The sky is the limit, for whatever you want to do
Don't let anyone tell you, it ain't possible
No matter how low you feel, keep going higher, higher
See I've been holding on, to my dreams too long
To watch it get away from me, 
This hand is mine to win, and I promise you that
I'll never, never give up

[Chorus: x2]

Like a candle 
Burning bright 
Love is glowing in your eyes 
A flame to light our way 
That burns brighter everyday 
But now I have you 
Nobody loves me like you do 

Like a leaf 
Upon the wind 
I could find no place to land 
I dream the hours away 
And wonder everyday 
Do dreams come true?
Nobody loves me like you do 

What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow 
Ooh, you touched my heart in places 
That I never even knew 
'Cause nobody loves me like you do 

I was words without a tune 
I was a song still unsung 
A poem with no rhyme 
A dancer out of time 
But now there's you 
Nobody loves me like you do 

What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now? 
Funny how life just falls in place somehow 
Ooh, you touched my heart in places 
That I never even knew 
Nobody loves me
(Nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me
(Nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me like you do 

Nobody loves me like you do

Here I sit by my window thinking about all the things that I've been through
There were times where I never thought I get to where I got to
Had some angels to guide me someone who just violate my love
Now this is my chance to say ain't go nothin' but love

For my family that raised me (shout out shout out)
And my teacher that done praised me (shout out shout out)
To anyone who tried to hate on me (shout out shout out)
Even the one's who tried to break me even the one's who tried to take me down

[Chorus]
There've been haters since this world been going 'round
(nothin' but love nothin' but love)
Why they take a thing and trying to crush them down
(nothin' but love nothin' but love)
I ain't even trying to hold on to that now
(nothin' but love nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but love for you
(nothin' but love nothin' but love)

I could hold on to pain but that ain't what my life's about
I ain't blaming nobody if I ain't got my stuff worked out
I got love for my self ain't goin' regret anything I've done
I just want to sing my song ain't got nothin' but love

For all the players on the street (shout out shout out)
To all my ghetto doing their own thing (keep on keep strong)
To all my exes that done wrong me stepped on me can't hold me down

[Chorus]

To all the givers and the takers
To my crew from way back when
To the cold wars and the stares
And the ones that I ain't met

For my self for sticking with me
For the one's I miss from up above
Anyone who's ever been a part of me
Ain't got nothin' but love
(Ain't got nothin' but love)

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x5]
Ain't got nothin' but love for you
(nothin' but love nothin' but love)

O come o come Emanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the son of God appears

Rejoice, rejoice
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel

(Bumm, bumm, bumm, bumm)
Ah well, ooh
(Bumm, bumm, bumm)

O come, desire of nations, bind
Bind as one the hearts of all mankind
Bid thou our sad divisions cease
And be thyself our king of peace

(Rejoice) rejoice (rejoice) Rejoice (Ooh)
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel
(Israel, come to thee)
Rejoice (rejoice) rejoice (Ooh)
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel
(O Israel, come to thee)
Rejoice (Rejoice) Rejoice (Ooh)
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel
(O Israel, come to thee)
Rejoice (Rejoice) Rejoice (Ooh)
Emanuel shall
(Shall come)

He's gonna come o Israel
(Shall come)
Don't you worry, God's gonna be there
(Emanuel shall come)
Emanuel, He's gonna come
O Israel
Ooh yeah

Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give
The best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown

I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will be
I will be
I will be free
I will be
I will be free

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
If there were no presents
Waiting on Santa's sleigh
What would I wish for Christmas
And if Frosty the snowman
Were melting away
I would pray for hope and unity
On Christmas day

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy
And peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one

If Rudolph and his reindeer
Ran into delays
I'd still hope for joy this season
And if somehow Santa got lost on his way
I would try to find a way to smile
Smile on Christmas day

Oh, if I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy
And peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one

You know it ain't about
All those material things (no no)
What you've gotta think about
Is the love Christmas brings (yeah)

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy
And peace here on earth
If I had (just one, just one) one wish for Christmas this year
That we'd all come together as one (together as one)

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy
And peace here on earth
If I had one, if I had one, if I had wish for Christmas this year
That we'd all, we'd all come together as one, ooh, as one, yeah

Ohh. This is just for me. 
Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
It's been one of those crazy weeks
And I gotta do something special for me

See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Gotta take time out
And my real ladies know what I'm talking about

Sing. Oooooooh, baby baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now. Oooooooh, baby baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you're out to see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

Tonight, it's all about me
Just wanna set my body free
Never mind the TV
Tonight I'll just let a little TV watch me
Light the candles, aroma therapy
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me
Mr. Big is in the background
The Isley Brothers gonna hold it down sing

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you're out to see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

Singing hello hello 
I need one of those days
You don't know what
Warm and beautiful

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Don't make no difference if I'm wrong or I'm right
I've got the feeling and I'm willing tonight
Well I ain't nobody's angel
What can I say, I'm just that way

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

You've got a problem with the way that I am
They say I'm trouble and I don't give a damn
But when I'm bad I know I'm better
I just want to get you, and turn it up for you

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
A girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean?

I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)

Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
If you only knew how much

I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

Eh eh eh eh eh eh oh

Say you want to walk away
You ain't got nothing to say
Well I salute you (eh)
Go on out the door now you take care

No more tears to shed
What you expecting me to beg
Well I'm not I'm done
So when you leave
Just close the door behind you

'Cause...
I'm feeling kind of taller than you (lately)
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you (lately)
I feel kind of better than you
And I know just what to do (yeah)

I feel like doing my hair
I'm feeling like calling some of my friends
I feel like going to a club
And partying

'Cause am I soldier girl in this world
I stand alone, I can be strong
I walk for miles and made it home
It's good to know without you I made it

Soldier girl in my world, took the fall now I stand tall
For the pain and all I made it through and now I'm vow to say to you
Salute

Eh eh eh
Eh eh eh
Salute
Eh eh eh
Eh eh eh

You think you know everything
See you think that your shit don't stink, well it do
Yeah, and when it comes to me you don't have a clue
It took me all of these years, to realize that you don't belong here

I can do better
You say, "I'll never do better"
Yeah right whatever 

'Cause
I'm feeling kinda taller than you (lately)
I'm feeling kinda stronger than you (lately)
I feel kinda better than you
And I know just what to do

I feel like doing my hair (my hair)

"So don't call it a comeback, no... I've been here for years"
Through all of the drama and the pain and all of the tears
It's time to stop this roller coaster, say I want to get off
And start moving mountains, swimming seas, and climbing over

I'm a soldier girl in this world
I stand alone, I can be strong
I walk for miles and made it home
It's good to know without you I made it

Soldier girl in my world, took the fall now I stand tall
For the pain and all I made it through and now I'm vow to say to you
Salute

Eh eh eh
Eh eh eh

I salute you...

Go on out the door, take care...

A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you
For you

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head

I've been waiting for  the phone to ring all night
Why you want to make me feel so good
I got a love of my own
Shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't like it so much
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby

Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk I just watch your mouth

I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't like it so much
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby

Somebody bigger than the Earth is round
Bigger than the saddest frown 
Bigger than the brightest smile 
And longer than the longest mile 

Somebody bigger than the biggest fight 
And darker than the darkest night 
Bigger than the biggest gun 
Cause he's the only shining sun see'mon

Who made the mountains 
Who made the trees 
Who made the rivers that flow out to the seas
And who hung the moon in the starry, starry, starry sky

[Chorus:]
Somebody bigger
I know I know he's bigger than you and I 
My God is bigger 
Somebody bigger
He's bigger, he's bigger than you
He's bigger than you 
My God is, my God is oh

Now who made the flowers bloom in the spring, yeah 
And who writes the songs for the robins to sing uh
And who sends the rain when the Earth is dry 
I know, I know, I know 
Somebody bigger yeah
Than you and I 
Somebody bigger than you and I
Bigger than you and I

He lights the way when road is alone 
Keeps me company with love to guide you
He walks beside you just like he walks with me

When I am weary, and filled with despair 
Who gives me courage to go on and on and on from there
And who gives me faith 
I will never, never, never, never, never doubt
Somebody bigger yeah 
Somebody bigger than me and you
Bigger than you and I
Somebody bigger 
My Lord is bigger than you
Bigger than you and I

He lights the way when the road is long
Keeps you company with love to guide you 
He walks beside you just like he walks with me 

Somebody bigger than you and I 
Bigger than the open sky 
Bigger than the tallest tree
Bigger than the deepest sea 
Somebody deeper than the desert sands 
Bigger than the tallest man 
And phatter than the phattest phat
Bigger than the Shaq attack 

[Chorus]

I'm here alone on a Friday night
Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio and me
Really ain't been getting along

I wish that I could fly away
And party 'til the break of day
And there I'll be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me

Then mama comes and asks me
Why am I dreaming sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever find
Someone for me
While I am young and seventeen

Someone for me
Someone for me
I've got to go find someone, someone
Someone for me
I've got to find someone, yeah

Now there's a party down at Angie's house
With people packed against the wall
I'm sitting in the corner here
Trying to make some sense of it all

And when I least expect it
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams
Here he is walking up to me and asking
If I'd like to come and dance with him
I think I've found someone for me

Someone for me
Someone for me
I've got to go find someone, someone
Someone for me
I've got to find someone

I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me
Someone

And so I'm finding out that dreams you believe in
Can come to be
And now I'm looking up to find the joy and happiness
Can come to you and me
At last I've found someone for me

Someone for me
Someone for me
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me
Someone
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone
Someone for me
Someone, someone, someone, someone, someone, someone for me
Someone for me
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, yeah yeah
Someone for me
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me
Someone
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone for me
Someone
Someone for me
Someone, somebody, someone, somebody, someone, somebody for me
Someone for me
Someone, somebody, someone, someone for me

I know I may have made mistakes before
But now I understand what those mistakes were for Throughout my travels girl I realized
What you see, what you get don't always coincide
A bird in the hand beats two in a bush
But just one look was all it took
Could it be thayt we're the only ones thinking of
Harmony, ecstacy, there's something about this love

[Chorus]
We, we have something in common
Girl (Boy) you mean so much to me it should be plain to see That we... We have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together

Now I'm the type of girl who understands my man
I'll be strong when he's weak, I will hold his hand
Now I believe old fashioned rules and old fashioned ways Courtesy, honesty, like in the old days
You're my man and I'm your girl
There's nothing better in this whole wide world
I'll stand by your side till the very end
All in all, best of love, we are friends

[Chorus]

Bobby Brown: Girl you know it's you that I adore
Whitney: And there's no one in this world that I love more

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Daring can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

Well there's a bridge and there's a river that I still must cross
As I'm going on my journey
Oh, I might be lost

And there's a road I have to follow, a place I have to go
Well no-one told me just how to get there
But when I get there I'll know
'Cause I'm taking it

Step by step, bit by bit,
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)
Step by step, day by day, mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh)

And this old road is rough and ruined
So many dangers along the way
So many burdens might fall upon me
So many troubles that I have to face

Oh, but I won't let my spirit fail me
Oh, I won't let my spirit go
Until I get to my destination
I'm gonna take it slowly 'cause I'm making it mine

Step by step, bit by bit,
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)
Step by step, day by day, mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Say it, baby, don't give up
You got to hold on to what you got,
Oh, baby, don't give up,
You got to keep on moving on don't stop (yeah yeah).
I know you're hurting, and I know you're blue,
I know you're hurting but don't let the bad things get to you.

Step by step, bit by bit,
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)
Step by step, day by day, mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh)

(C'mon baby got to keep moving),
I'm taking it step by step), bit by bit,
Stone by stone (yeah, stone by stone), brick by brick
C'mon baby,
Step by step keep on moving, day by day (day by day-ee),
Mile by mile by mile by mile,go your own way,
C'mon baby got to keep moving, bit by bit (bit by bit, bit by bit)

I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams (C'mon)
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

Boy haven't you noticed
A gleam in my eye
Because of you
I'm a little hypnotized
But every time you're with me
I feel so positive
Now with a little love
Something's got to give

A full moon (Yeah yeah)
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I

You are no Casanova
I know that you'll be true
And that's why
I'm so in love with you
But each romantic ending
You leave me at my door
But tonight
I'd like us to explore

A full moon
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart

Just you and I

See, I saw you at the party
With your eyes on me
Fittin' the description
On what I want my bride to be (Ha, ha)
As live as me
Don't know the same guys as me
But a lot of style
And usin' wild name like Ivory
I agree with my niggas
You the baddest I ever seen in a long time (Uh)
But woman with her own shine
Is on time
And I don't hit
'Cause I'm tired of dealin' with the wrong kind
Getting non' but the bullshit
She got a playa tryin' to think of new things to say (Sup, baby)
She up in the corner sippin' Don P, Rosee' (Yeah)
Shakin' it up with the homegirls
Payin' no attention to us
They in they own world
'Hey, yo, girl'
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything you see in your dreams
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

Sounds so right (Uh, huh)
The mood is right

To keep me warm
Away from harm
Nowhere better than my baby's arms

You know I need your love
Romance

Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning when you find your heart a home
I've see it in the movies, read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it but your touch was all it took

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic 'til you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer I'll be drowning in your eyes
You're the one I needed most when my love was on that line
I'm so glad you gave me yours when I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good (oh it keeps me feelin' so)
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of me

Baby, you're the first to take it
And you're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good (oh it keeps me feelin' so)
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart

There's a chance that maybe in this life I'll find
True love and peace of mind
There's a chance that maybe I can reach my goal
And soar to the other side
Good things come to those who wait
I'm just afraid that I might sit here and wait too late, so...

[CHORUS:]
I'm taking a chance on loving you
No matter the price i'll pay my dues
I'm taking a chance on loving you 
They tell me I'm crazy

There's a chance that maybe once I could be wrong
But wrong never felt so right
There's a chance that maybe I'm risking much too soon
But our hearts just fell in tune

Good things come to those who wait
I'm just afraid that I might sit here and wait too late, so...

[chorus]
I don't know much about you, but I know I can't live without you
I am telling all my friends goodbye
My friends can't understand but, 
I know I've got to try,
Here's my reason why,
I'm in love, that's all I know

[chorus]

Reaching for my dreams and
You're so quick to say what I can't do.
You criticize my actions but
I don't see you standing in my shoes.
I'm going the wrong way
And doing the wrong things
Every word just gives me fuel
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on! 

[Chorus]
Tell me no
I'll show you I can
Tell me no
I'll dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Come on and go!
Tell me no! 

For every step I take you're right there
Trying to block my next move.
And if you're making me feel bad,
Then tell me then do you feel good?
I'm just human and all I'm doing
Is what my heart tells me I should
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on! 

[Chorus]

No no no no no no
It motivates me more and more
And I think it's time you know
You're giving me something to look forward
And I can't wait for the day
I can rub things in your face
I ain't gon stop til I'm done
I've reached the top, I'm Number One
But every time you try and tell me no
Oh it makes me keep on keeping on 

[Chorus]

(Oh well oh Lord)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (well)
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (well)
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

You now that, you know that, you know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
Everybody's mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
From kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Happy Hanukkah
Happy Kwanzaa
Merry Christmas to
To all of you
Merry Christmas to everyone

And my cup keeps running over and over and over yeah
Surely goodness and mercy

(Forever and ever) Ever and ever
Amen, Amen, Amen

Wonderful counselor
Prince of peace
Mighty good shepherd
I love you, Lord

Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seemed like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fear
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way safe through the rain
Thought of a still resilient voice
Says love is very near

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
Now you will
You will when you believe

You will when you believe
Just believe
Gotta believe
You will when you believe

Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner!  Oh long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto:  "In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Think it over, think it over... 

Some people say You've been messing around, 
Wish You could hear what they say
I'm not too sure, But You're just not the same, 
We got to find us a way
 
[Chorus:]
Think it over, 
Before You do something to tear us apart
Think it over, 
All this talk is breaking My heart
Think it over, 
Before You go out and do it again, 
Think it over, 
Just get together before it all ends
Think it over, Think it over

In the beginning, we both really cared
That's something that You should know
Let's think about all the love that we shared, 
You shouldn't let it all go, so

Think it over, 
Before You do something to tear us apart
Think it over, 
All this talk is breaking My heart
Think it over, 
Before You go out and do it again, 
Think it over, 
Just get together before it all ends
Think it over, Think it over

Think, Think it over
Think it over, 
Think, Think it over, over

Better think, 
Better think of the things You've done to Me
Better think, 
Better think before I set You free
Better think, 
Better think before You do wrong again
Better think, 
Better think before the evening ends

Think, Think it over
Think it over, 
Think, Think it over

Better think, Better think
What it's like to be all alone
Better think, Better think
What it's like in an empty home
Better think, Better think
'Cause I'm willing to forgive and forget
Better think about the love
That You ain't gonna get

Think it over

Can't we forget about the love that we had.
And make it just like brand new
I'm not too proud to forgive and forget, 
But baby, what about you?

(Ooh, I'm just a fool for you)

I can't get you off my mind 
No matter what I do 
I'm wishing you were here with me 
It makes no difference 
I only think of you 
And I'm living out my fantasy 

Late at night, a rendezvous 
Being such a love sick fool 
It might be pouring rain (it could be pouring)
But still the same, nothing's changed 
All in all I feel no shame 
I'm just your fool the same 
(I'm just your fool) 
(I keep thinking about you, baby) 
So tell me what you're gonna do 
(I keep thinking about you) 
All I wanna do is 
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind)
(I'm thinking about you) 
That's what I wanna do 
(Pick me up, let's go down) 
(I'm thinking about it, too)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm thinking about you) 
Ya got me thinking about you 
(I'm thinking about it, too) 

Maybe weeping is a game 
That's hard for me to face 
(Don't you need me) 
Just like I need you 
There's no reason 
Just my heart that makes me feel this way 
And I hope you feel the same way, too 

Late at night, a rendezvous 
Being such a love sick fool 
It might be pouring rain (it could be pouring)
But still the same, nothing's changed 
All in all I feel no shame 
I'm just your fool the same 
I'm just your fool
(I keep thinking about you, baby) 
So tell me what you're gonna do 
Got me thinking about you 
All I wanna do is 
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind)
(I'm thinking about you) 
That's what I wanna do 
(Pick me up, let's go down) 
(I'm thinking about it, too)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm thinking about you) 
Got me thinking about you 
(I'm thinking about it, too) 

It might be pouring rain 
But like a fool, insane 
I run, I run, I run, I run to you 
I'm just a love sick fool 
I've got this thing for you
(I'm just, I'm just a love sick fool)

I'm just a fool for you
(I keep thinking about you, baby) 
So tell me what you're gonna do 
Got me thinking about you 
All I wanna do is 
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind)
(I'm thinking about you) 
That's what I wanna do 
(Pick me up, let's go down) 
(I'm thinking about it, too)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm thinking about you) 
Got me thinking about you 
(I'm thinking about it, too)

(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind)
(I'm thinking about you) 
That's what I wanna do 
(Pick me up, let's go down) 
(I'm thinking about it, too)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I'm thinking about you) 
Got me thinking about you

I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl you used to know
So long ago
I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes which way to go
And I should know
I put myself aside to do it your way
But now I need to do it all alone

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'll keep it real, you know
Time for me to do it on my own
Yeah yeah, mmm, yeah yeah

It's over now
I can't go back to living through your eyes
Too many lines
And if you don't know by now
I can't go back to being someone else
Not anymore
I never had a chance to do things my way
So now it's time for me to take control

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real you know
Time for me to do it

Oh, I start again go back to one
I'm running things in my way
Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it
I'm taking names, the ones of mine
Yes I'm gonna take my turn
It's time for me to finally stand alone, stand alone

I am not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real, you know
It's time for me to do it
See I'm not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real, you know
It's time for me to do it on my own, hey, on my own

If I changed my mind
If I changed my faith
Every time a stop light signaled
Each time I made mistakes

I don't think that I would be where I am today
I live my life without regrets
What you see is, what you see is
What you see is what you get and I'm

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed, unashamed

Adding up my life, it totals all my dreams
I'm counting all my blessings and the gifts I have received
Still there's always someone, something to overcome
Took all my life to understand that I am what I am, who I am
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Do you wanna know how it goes?
Do you wanna control how I feel?
Do you wanna stay in my life?
Then listen here and listen good
You got to get it, got to get it, got to get it right
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved
Of things I've done, my belief in the one

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

I lost my heart a long time ago 
You made me feel like no one had before 
Boy, you made me love you 
Then you walked out the door 
See, I will not rest until you say I'm forever yours 

[Chorus]
And boy I won't stop at nothing 
I won't give you up 
And you've gotta feel something 
I know I will not love again 
Until you come back 
Come back to my arms 
Till you come back to me baby 
Until you come back 

I don't care how long baby 
It's not important to me 
Don't care how far 
Love's never too far for me, oh no it ain't 
I just might be crazy, yes I am 
When it comes to my heart 
But I can not rest until 
The day we're no longer apart 

[Chorus]

To me 
Nobody plays with my heart 
You can walk away from it all, baby 
You can run but your heart can not hide 
'Cause it knows you belong in my arms 

[Chorus]

To me 
Oh yeah 
Till you come back to me baby 
Come on home, come home 
To me

Oh, look out
Oh uh, come on
What'chu like, a whole lot of, whut?
(Tyrese yeah)
What'chu like, me on a, whut?
(What'cha like, what'cha like?)
What'chu like? (Can you tell me, baby)
Why? How? All night long
(All night long)

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian with
Good conversation plenty big faces
It's a must I stay luxurious
Jewelry cut precision like I bust
Been winnin' since Funkdafied blew up
It's evident, shit I can't be touched
Niggas say I'm too much, I trust it's true
Why lie? See for yourself when I slide through
Drive by, your bitch say don't look, you do
Shine so bright in the wet U2
You wish boo boo could ride with you tonight
Ain't nothing in the world that Brat can't do
She attractive to them, him, her, and you shit
Frostbit, December Unrestricted
Drop dead, the cost is priceless
Due to the content I suggest you'll like this

[Chorus]
What do you like?
A whole lot of foreplay
Right before you get it started
What do you like?
Me on top
You on the bottom, tight body
What do you like?
Somebody that can make you say
Wow, know how to all night long
All night long, tell me

Whassup? The setting, a hot-ass club
And you still be sweating me
I don't see nothing wrong with giving a little love
But nigga just let me breathe
Damn, you cute as hell so let's switch the digits
Then I got to leave
And you can buy me a couple of drinks
But I'mma go socialize and smoke my weed
And I like it when you keep your eyes on me
And I like it when you touch my privacy
And I like it sex and ecstasy
When the belt buckle loosen up, undress me
Already juiced up, that come naturally
Wax on and off so romantically
No woman can slow dance or throw down like I can
Ask if you curious to know what I like, man

[Chorus]

Let me tell you something
Well I start at the top of the list
With my pretty eyes, a cute nose and these fat ass lips
My medallion sit in the middle of my tits
It's hit after hit, shit sweet every sip 
Down to the last drip drop, watch the hips rock
Color Me Bad, tick tock you don't stop 
'Till the thick thighs, dick rise when I skip by
I ain't surprised I'm what'chu like nigga

[Chorus]

Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood

Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe

(Mmmmmmmmmyeah)
Mmmyeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain

Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain

Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)

Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)

When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
(Hey)
(Ooh)

They don't always happen when you ask
And its easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain

A small but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near, oh (Oh)
There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah) (Though hope is frail)

Though hope is frail (Its hard)
Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)

When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe (When you)
(Oh oh)

(You will when you)
(You will when you believe)
(Ohoohooh)
(Oh, oh)

(When you believe)
(When you believe)

I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh

Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh

Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know

Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care

Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me, for me
You still care for me

Who do you love do you love love love 
Who do you love do you love 
I got a feeling you're the boy for me 
I bet your love can set me free 
I feel a love thing going 
It started weak then got oh so strong 

Strong enough to rock the world 
Straight up I want to be your girl 
So I keep praying to the stars above 
That it's me who you're gonna love 

Am I the one (yeah) 
Is she the one 
Who do you love 

[Chorus] 
(Who) Who do you love 
I want to know 
Could it be me 
Won't you tell me so 
Who do you love 
You've got to say 
Don't want to go 
Why can't I stay 

I keep pushing so you'll be mine 
We'll be loving baby over time (heh) 
My sensitivity gets so high 
It keeps me dreaming that you're my guy 

Then I have to stop and check myself 
Could it be that you love someone else 
I can't give in to jealousy 
So touch me now if you love me Am I the one (ha ha ha come on now) 
Is she the one (make up your mind) 
Who do you love 
Am I the one (who do you love huh) 
Is she the one (ow) 
Who do you love 
Am I the one (am I the one) 
Is she the one (Is she the one) 
Who do you love 
Am I the one (I'm waiting) 
Is she the one (I'm waiting ha ha ha) 
Who do you love 

[Chorus]

Mommies and daddies always believe
That their little angels are special indeed
And you could grow up to be anything
But who would imagine a king

A shepherd or teacher is what you could be
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
Or maybe a carpenter building things
But who would imagine a king

It was so clear when the wise men arrived
And the angels were singing your name
That the world would be different 'cause you were alive
That's what heaven stood still to proclaim

One day an angel said quietly
That soon he would bring something special to me
And of all those wonderful gifts he could bring

Who would imagine, who could imagine
Who would imagine a king

Mmm
Mommy

Why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why does it hurt so bad
I thought I had let you go
So why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad
Oh it hurts so bad baby

My life's been better
Since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said I would boy
I found someone who loves me for me
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
I thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why does it hurt so bad
Baby I thought I had let you go
So why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
Hurts me so bad
Hurts so (yeah you do)
Hurts so (hurts me so)
Hurts so bad (did you know)
Hurts so (that it hurts me so)
Hurts so (so bad, hey hoh)

"Never again" that's what I said to myself
I never want to feel kind of pain again boy
Just when I think it's over
Just when I think it's through
I find myself right back in love with you

So why does it hurt so bad oh baby
Why do I feel so sad
(thought I thought I) Thought I was over you
I keep crying
When I don't love you (when I really don't love you boy)
(oh no oh no oh no oh no it hurts so bad, oh tell me)
So why does it hurt so bad
I thought I had let you go (thought I could let you go)
You could
Gotta get you outta my head
Boy you hurt me so bad
Hurts so (yeah you do)
Hurts so (hurt me so)
Hurts so bad (hurts so)
Hurts so (sure you did)
Hurts so (make me want to make me want to shoop shoop)
Hurts so bad (hurt me so, gotta shoop now)
Hurts so bad (Hurts me so)
Oh why, you hurt me so bad
Bad (how 'bout that?)

I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

That you give good love to me, baby
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
It's never too much
Baby, you give good love

Never stopping, I was always searching
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

That you give good love to me, baby
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
It's never too much
Baby, you give good love

Now I can't stop looking around
It's not what this life's all about
Our love is here to stay, to stay
Baby, you give good love

(You give good love to me)
(Never too much, will never be)
So good
Take this heart of mine
Into your hands
You give good love to me
Never, never too much
No, no, no, no, no
You give good love to me
So good, so good

(You give good love, darlin')
(You give, you give, baby)
(You give good love, honey)
(You give good love, baby)
(You give good love, darlin')
(You give, you give, baby)
(You give good love to me)

You give me good love
Good love, good love
Yeah, you do
You know what I need

(You give good love to me)
(Never too much, will never be)

So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now
You've come along

And you light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey,
I love you
Never again to be all alone

'Cause you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

And you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
With song
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life, my life, my life, my life oooh

We all want to make a place in this world 
We all want our voices to be heard 
Every one wants a chance to be someone 
We all have dreams we need to dream 
Sweeter than any star you can reach 
'cause when you reach and find, you've found someone 
You'll hold this world's most priceless thing 
The greatest gift this life can bring 
Is when you look back and know 
You were loved 

[Chorus]
You were loved by someone 
Touched by someone 
Held by someone 
Meant something to someone 
Loved somebody 
Touched somebody's heart 
Along the way 
You can look back and say (mm) 
You were loved (yes you were) 

You can have diamonds in your hands 
Have all the riches in the land 
But, without love, 
You don't really have a thing, no no 
When somebody cares that you're alive 
When somebody trusts you with their life 
That's when you'll know (huh) 
That you have all you need 
You'll hold this world's most priceless gift 
The finest treasure that there is 
You can look back and know 
You were loved 

[Chorus]

So many roads that you can take 
Whatever way you go 
Don't take that road alone 
It's better you should know 

[Chorus]

So remember to tell that special one (yeah, mm) 
You were loved 
You were loved 
You were loved 
You were loved 
Hey hey hey hey hey

If there's a time
When the tears should fill your eyes
And you can't see past the shadows
To the sun on the other side
Don't despair
Because there always will be someone there
Don't lose faith
Love won't let you lose your way, because you

You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by

Oh yes it is, yes
If there's a day when the rain should find your heart
And you're cold and tired and lonely
And this world has you in the dark
Don't be scared
You can just reach for me
And I'll be there
Don't lose hope
Love will see you through you know
I'll be, 'cause you

You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by

Standing by to life you above
All the hurt and pain, oh yeah
Standing by to carry you through
All the tears and rain
Oh reach for me
(I'll be there for you)
Reach for me babe, yeah
(I'll see you through)
See I'll be the one to hold you
The one to show you that you

You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by

You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by

Oh, love is standing by

On the day that you left me 
You said you had no regrets 
There's a bond between us
That hasn't been broken yet 
And the feelings between us 
Will never disappear 
How can you be far away 
When your spirit's here 

[Chorus] 
You're still my man 
Nothing can change it 
We still belong together 
You're still my man 
Nothing can change it 
Our love will last forever 

And the seasons of our love 
Will always change I know 
Maybe that's the reason 
You felt we had to go 
But soon you'll be missing me 
Darling I know you well 
There's a magic we share together 
And no one can break that spell 

[Chorus] 

I'll wait for you 
The thought that keeps me going each day 
Is I believe you still love me 
I love you more than words can say 

[Chorus] 

You're still my man 
Nothing's gonna change it 
Don't you know, you oughta know we belong together 
You're still my man 
And nothing can change it 
Oh baby oh darling you're in my heart forever 
'cause you're my man 
Without you 
Darling, our love at all 

You're still my man 
Nothing can change it 
Don't you know you oughta know we belong together 
Oh You're still my man 
Nothing can change it 
Oh baby oh darling you're in my heart forever 
You're still my man 
Nothing can change it 
I'm yours, you know you're mine 
You're in my heart forever 

You're still my man 
Nothing can change it 
Don't you know you ought to know we belong together 
You're still my man

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching

But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me

Daring can't you pease see through me
'Cause we're alone now nd I'm singing this song for you
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding

But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine

And when my life is over remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
Gonna take some getting used to 
Now that love is here to stay

[Chorus] 
After we make love
It's so good to be lost in the afterglow
All I'm dreaming of
I just can't let the feeling go 

After we make love 
I feel I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow
All that matters is right here and now

Now the world is full of wonder
You've turned my life around in just one day
I love the spell you've put me under
Just one kiss can take my breath away

[Chorus] 

After we make love 
I feel I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow
All that matters is right here and now

All the lonely days and nights
Were well worth going through
I'm so glad I didn't give my heart away
So I could give it all to you

I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
Gonna take some getting used to 
Now that love is here to stay

[Chorus] 

After we make love
I feel I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow
All that matters is right here and now

Ain't no way
For me to love you
If you won't let me

It ain't no way
For me to give you all you need
If you won't let me
Give all of me

I know that a woman's duty
Is to have and love a man
And that's the way it was planned

Oh but how can I, how can I, how can I
Give you all the things I can
If your tying up both of my hands
Oh ain't no, ain't no way (ain't no way)

It ain't no way no, no, no (ain't no way)
Sho' ain't no way (ain't no way)
It ain't no way (ain't no way)

It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

So, stop trying to be
Someone your not

Hard, cold and cruel is a man
Who paid to much for what he's got

And if you need me
Won't you say, say you do
Because if you need me
Don't you know I need you
Ain't no way

All at once 
I finally took a moment 
And I'm realizing that 
You're not coming back 
And it's finally hit me all at once 
All at once I've started counting teardrops 
And at least a million fell 
My eyes began to swell 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 

Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once I looked around and found that you were 
With another love 
In someone else's arms 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 
All at once the smile that used to greet me 
Brightened someone else's day 
She took your smile away 
And left me with just memories all at once 

Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more

The strangest thought came to me on this morning
As I awake to greet the coming dawn
The sun was hardly peaking through the garden
It felt that with everything, I was one

Then I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower, as a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower

To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love

The dew had finished making love to many
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air
I envied all the silence I saw growing
So unmoved by things outside of themselves

And how I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower, as a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower

To spread the sweetness of love

How I wished that I could come back as a flower
Oh, as a flower, as a flower
How I wished that I could come back as a flower
As a flower, as a flower

To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love

Never needed a wishing well to make my happy with my baby
Never needed a magic spell to start me thinking someday maybe
I'll build a house of gingerbread someday,
And bring my sugar cookie home to stay 'cause

Ain't no lovin like my baby's
Ain't no lovin like my baby's love
Ain't no lovin like my baby's

She's the girl that I am dreaming of
Oh, my Angel Love can't stop dreaming of
How it's gonna be
It's gonna be for Angel Love and me
Goin' down to the wishing well
Cause that's where I'm gonna meet my baby

Mr Moon mixed a magic spell
He's telling me that I better hurry
To find the girl beneath the willow tree
And run and take my baby home with me 'cause

Ain't no lovin like my baby's
Ain't no lovin like my sugar's love
Ain't no lovin like my baby's

She's the girl that I am dreaming of
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (hey) Hoo, hooo
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (ain't no love)

Never, never, never, never, never ha, ha

Come on up you say
Cause you can feel your love comin' down
I find myself rushin' over to
Do something for your love

I knock on the door
You answer askin' what am I there for
I say I thought you wanted me to
Do something for your love

I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothin'
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

That lets me know that I will once again
Get nothin' from your love

And if I had some time later in the day to
Do something for your love

Anyone else would say
"No that's okay"
But maybe by now she'll see things my way
And ask me to say to
Do something for her love

I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothin'

Coming to give something but to get none of your love

All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say

But all is changed with time
The future no one can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery

But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay

But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play

But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

Ha ha yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Oh my pretty little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

My little precious angel
Don't you know I'm glad I found ya
I'm gonna dedicate my life to you
And build my world around you

I'm gonna love you through the years
I'll never bring you pain nor tears
I wanna keep you satisfied
So you'll never, never, never leave my side

Oh my pretty little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

Angel baby Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

'Cause I love ya and I need ya
And I'll treat you oh so kind
If you ever leave me baby
I'd go right out of my mind

My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

Angel baby Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

Girl you're my sunshine
You make me smile when skies are grey
But I'll never, never smile again
If somebody take my sunshine away
So I'm gonna work and toil, sweat and strain
Try to give you everything

So no rich man, poor man beggar man thief
Could ever steal you away from me

My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

Angel baby Don't you spread your wings

My little angel baby
Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you never ever leave me

Angel baby Don't you spread your wings
Angel baby don't you ever leave me

I was drifting from day to day
Like a child that's lost his way
In a great big world

Then a miracle happened by
When you happened into my life
And said you love me
All around me the world was cold
Then you tenderly touched my soul
With your sunshine girl

And my future you gave it birth
And my living you gave it worth
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true,
Oh ho ho

When I'm feelin' my faith is gone
You're my reason for going on
Through another day
Cause the tender times that we share
Truly show me that you care about me

Whenever life makes you cry
Just remember I'm standing by
To lead the way
And together we'll never fall
Together we'll conquer all
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true

La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la

For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see
For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two
For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray
For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two
For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see
For you
There might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me

I love you,
But I've been away from you so long.
God, take me back to where I belong, baby.
I'll do what you want me to.
I'll do what you want me to do.
I'll do anything.

I want you.
I never needed you so bad.
Why do you feel like making me so sad?
Girl, I'll do whatever you want me to.
I'll do what you want me to do.
I'll do anything that you want me to.

Love's the thing that's made us happy.
Love's the thing that's made us sad.
If we don't get back together, 
We might lose our romance.
Might not get a second chance...

I love you,
And I want to be your man.
If you tell me that I can, baby,
You know I'll do whatever you want me to.
I'll do what you want me to do.
I'll do anything that you want me to do.

Love's the thing that's made us happy.
Love's the thing that's made us sad.
If we don't get back together, 
We might lose our romance.
Might not get a second chance...

I love you,
And I want to be your man.
If you tell me that I can, baby,
You know I'll do whatever you want me to.
I'll do what you want me to do.
I'll do anything that you want me to do.

I'll do what you want me to.
I'll do what you want me to do.
I'll do anything that you want me to do.

Everything you want me to;
I'll do what you want me to do.
I'll do anything that you want me to do.

Every, every, every, every, every, every, every, every, every...
I'll do what you want me to do.
I'll do anything that you want me to do.

Everything.
Everything you want me to do.

I'll do what you want me to do.
I'll do anything that you want me to do.

I'll admit that you've been 
Playing with my heart 
Just like it was a toy 
And I've been playing along 
And letting you treat me wrong 
Because it seems to give you joy 

Are you sure love is the name of this game 
Are you sure love is the name of this game 

For days on end you just stay away 
Waitin' for my heart to weaken 
It's like we're playing hide and seek 
And I'm the one who's always seeking 

Are you sure love is the name of this game 
I wanna know 
Are you sure L-O-V-E love is the name of this game 

Well if everything's right 
And uptight 
How come the heartaches keep repeating 
With every beat my heart is beating 
Now can it be that you've been cheating 
Cheating on me 

Now how come you keep on 
Telling me lies 
Filling my life with sorrow 
Don't know what to expect 
From your affection 
It's here today and gone tomorrow 

Are you sure love, love, love is the name of this game 
I wanna know 
Are you sure L-O-V-E love is the name of this game

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky

Close your eyes 'til the morning
Close your eyes 'til the early dew
Get inside what you've been missing
Are the very first words that I heard coming from you

Take a chance on the secret
That you hide for beneath your dreams
Use your wildest imagination
You just tell me what it is and I will make it be

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

Let's get high on the happy
With a toast to you and me
Love is here just for the giving
And between us we've got all the love we'll ever need

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving 
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May 
Just as hate knows love's the cure 
You can rest your mind assure 
That I'll be loving you always 
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow 
But in passing will grow older every day 
Just as all is born is new 
Do know what I say is true 
That I'll be loving you always 

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky, always
Until the ocean covers every mountain high, always 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea, always 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 

Did you know that true love asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee 
To last through forever and another day 
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning 
And the seasons know exactly when to change 
Just as kindness knows no shame 
Know through all your joy and pain 
That I'll be loving you always 
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow 
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear 
For I'll know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've left behind Cause I'll be loving you always 

Until the day is night and night becomes the day, always
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away, always
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, always
Until the day that is the day that are no more 
Did you know that you're loved by somebody? 
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left, always
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself 
I'll be loving you forever 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through, always

I was never spellbound by a starry sky
What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven 
For you are mine at last
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven

Ave Maria
Gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena

Benedicta tu in mulieribus
Et benedictus
Et benedictus fructus ventris
Ventris tuae, Jesu

Benedicta tu in mulieribus

Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart
'Cause I sacrifice to make you happy
Get nothin' for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I believe, baby, you'd better keep on keepin' on
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, oh don't do it baby
Don't break my heart

My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much
And lettin' you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causin' me
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best
Don't you do it, don't break my heart

Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?
I'm no good without you, can't go on without you
Life's no good without you, what'm I gonna do without you?
Baby don't do it, don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby, don't you break my heart
What'm I gonna do without you?
Got to go on, baby
Baby don't you do it

She was five and I was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
She would always win the fight

Bang bang she shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang I shot you down
Bang bang you hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang I used to shoot you down

The music played and people sang
And just for me the church bells rang

Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Hey!
Bang bang bang bang
Yeah!
Bang bang bang bang

Now she's gone I don't know why
'Till this day some times I cry
She didn't even say goodbye
She didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang she shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

Whoo!

Girl I've been cryin' ever since you left
My mama told me get a hold of yourself
And be cool, calm and keep yourself together
She said be cool, calm and keep yourself together, ha ha ha, ha

Sugar plum you're really gold
And it just don't help to cry
So I wiped my tears away the other day
And strung my handkerchief up to dry
Then I changed my style puttin' on a smile
And went out to face the world
The smile I wear see, ha, I don't care that I just lost my girl
But I still get that old yearnin'
Can't be cool when my heart is burnin'
I still get that old feelin'
Can't be calm when my head is reelin'

I say mother dear see here, see here
Tell me now what shall I do
Can't have that girl and I love her true
She said when things give up be manly
Now to be cool, calm, and keep yourself together
That's what my mama said
Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together, ha ha

Sugar pie you said goodbye
And I cried myself to sleep
That's when my mother said don't lose your head son
It just don't help to weep
Now I'm the great pretender
I don't surrender to what I feel inside
I'm the life of the crowd, and ha, I left my blood
But it's all a fake disguise
'Cause I still hear my heart poundin'
Hard to be cool when you come around me
I still feel my heart purrin'
Hard to be calm when my insides stirrin'

I say mother dear see here, see here
Tell me now which way to go
Can't have that girl and I love her so
She said whenever you're blue, whatever you do
Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together
That's what my mama said
Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together

Close your eyes; beddy-bye, tin soldier.
Mommy says that it's time for sleep.
If my folks were wiser and older,
They'd know kids and toys don't need sleep.

Don't be bad, little cotton dolly.
See how nice Mickey Mouse sleeps now?
Even my brass drummer boy has stopped all his noise,
Cause he knows it's past bedtime for toys.

Ya know, every Christmas, Santa Claus goes all over the world with his reindeer,
Sled, and a big bag of toys, and he'll come to your house this year, too.
But sometimes, just sometimes, he doesn't have enough time 
To see every little boy and girl, because the world is so big.
So maybe we should sing a song for all the children that Santa didn't visit.

Bless the child who has no tin soldier;
No brass drummer boy to put to bed. 
He will still grow wiser and older,
Loving one small rag doll, instead.

He won't have a cotton dolly;
Mickey Mouse won't come to his house.
Hold that rag doll to your heart; nothing can destroy 
The beauty one shall find in one small toy.

Been through the storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs man
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin' to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin' down my do'
Wonderin' where my next blessing is comin' from

My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a youngin', peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin' against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin' the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin'
Blendin' in with city folk, down in Flat-bush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin' I been through it
In other words I

Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin' to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guyanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin' into shit
Like we innocent, actin' older than should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin' all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin' 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin'
To hell with just gettin' by and economizin'
It's kinda hard bein' humble in the belly of struggle
Doin' things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin' money while we keepin' it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin' the faith
Mom and pop be worryin' for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin' look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin'
Across the line until somebody tryin' to cap me, oh shit 

I been through the storm
Through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real

Yeah

Your name is big brother
You say that you're watching me on the tele,
Seeing me go nowhere,
Your name is big brother,
You say that you're tired of me protesting,
Children dying everyday,
My name is nobody
But I can't wait to see your face inside my door ooh

Your name is big brother
You say that you got me all in your notebook,
Writing it down everyday,
Your name is I'll see ya,

Do do do do do do, do do

Someday I will move on my feet to the other side,

My name is secluded, we live in a house the size of a matchbox,
Roaches live with us, wall to wall

You've killed all our leaders,
I don't even have to do nothin' to you,
You'll cause your own country to fall

Uuh uh
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Ooh oh
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Simon says that now your mind desires a vacation
Free to join in fun and plenty recreation
There awaits you a ticket
At please have a good time station, yeah
'Cause what is, is gonna stay
Til ole father time decides to change

Simon says that your mind is requesting furlough
Let it find the answers to things
That you've always wanted to know
There's a tour of many places
That you've always wanted to go, yeah
And to me that sure sounds best
'Cause it means happiness for you

There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills
A mind excursion can be such a trill
You please satisfy
Take the chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky

Do do do do do do do do do do do do

Tudo bem voce deve descannar a sua mente
Natilde faz mal o qu vai acontecer daqui pra fente

Voce coracao assim tao feliz ja vai cantar carnaval

There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills
A mind excursion can be such a trill
You please satisfy

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do (the bird of beauty of the sky)

Do do do do do do

Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods; I don't believe the news
Or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again

You know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we got is lettin' a person feel that they're important
And a man can't get himself together until 
He knows who he is and be proud of what and who he is
And where he come from, and where he come from

Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
Them guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans

You know, you know, you know, 
One way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is 
Lettin' a person feel that they're somebody
And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, 
And be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from

Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away

Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it
Oh yes, my love has gone astray

But I'll blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees

I'll blame it on the time that never was enough
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea
But, my heart blames it on me

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?

Wish I could tell you
What I am feeling
But words won't come for me to speak

Oh, but I'll blame it on the sun
That didn't fill the sky
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees

I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be
But, my heart blames it on me

Yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh
Your heart blames it on you this time

I like to see you boogie
Right across the floor

Would you choose me?
Would you let me take you home

Ah ah listen everybody (body), specially you girls (girls)
Is it right to be left alone when the one you love is never home
I love too hard my friends sometimes say
But I believe I believe that a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside to see you treat me so unkind
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't fair

Can I get a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
Somebody (Can I get a witness)

Is it right to be treated so bad when you give her everything you had
Keep on talking in my sleep 'cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now you kids you all agree is that the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Took to find it out all night I been cryin'
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
I'm gonna stick by hr till the very end
Well she causes so much misery how's a gal supposed to be
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't right

Can I get a witness, can I get a witness
(Can I get a witness), I want a witness
(Can I get a witness), witness, witness

You just could not know how long we tried
To see how this building looks inside
This must be a lucky day for me
Because the sign says there's a vacancy
Look I know you came a long way
But you made it just too late
So we had to give it to somebody else
Well I talked to you on the phone less than fifteen minutes ago
And you told me that it was cool
I graduated from Howard U.
My job is paying good money too
And if you check on my resume
You'll find they all wanted me to stay

Well I can't take the time out
To check your credit card
Cause the computer just broke down today
Well I'll stop by here tomorrow to complete our interview
But I know what you're gonna say
I know what your bottom line is 

You might have the cash but you 
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash but you 
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Too-oo, too-oo too bad, 
Too-oo, too-oo too sad

Our first child is due here any day
That's why we're desperate for a place to stay
The location is so perfect too
So please try to do what you can do

Well in this apartment complex no children are allowed
And if you told me that I could have saved you a lot of time
Well I thought the Bill was passed that said you could not discriminate
But I know some excuse you'll find
Because your bottom line is

You might have the cash but you
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash but you
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Aye, you might be a great doctor
You might be a great lawyer
You might possess the key to the city
Or maybe a politician 
You might have the cash but you 
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash but you 
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here

Mm
On the beach where young lovers meet
You can see them there as they sit and build
Castles in the sand

Heavenly she's so heavenly
When she smiles at you
And she helps you build castles in the sand

The time comes when you stop pretending
For all dreams must come to an ending
Remember what happens to castles of sand
The sea will wash them away
Oh

And the beach where they used to meet
By the sand and sea waves have washed away
Castles in the sand
Castles in the sand
Where did they go
Castles in the sand
Tell me, where did they go
Castles in the sand
I wanna know where did they go

What we got here
Is not a fool`s dream
We really feel the need
We`ve come to ground
Like prisoners on the run
Just minutes away from freedom
Ain`t no use in fooling ourselves
We really feel the need
Whatever it takes
Nothing will be too much
We both long for better days

Baby, we`re different as the seasons
Never ever giving reasons
Left with the tears
And the paralysing fear
That brings us to our knees

[Chorus:]
Change
Bring on the changes
Change
Bring on the changes

It`s no pretending, no denying
When you really feel the need
Going to hang on and be strong
Turn the tables, make the change

The two of us, different as the seasons
Never ever giving reasons
Left with the tears
And the paralyzing fear
That brings us to our knees


[Chorus:] x 2
There`s gotta be some give and take
If we ever gonna make a change


[Chorus:] x 2

It's Christmastime and its magic is here
It's Christmastime and its wonders appear
The scent of pine fills the Christmasy air
While the church bell chimes and there's joy everywhere

Some precious gift lights a little one's eyes
God's blessed lived, stays the weary and wild
This Christmastime, keep its magic right here
Within your heart everyday of the year

[Harmonica Solo]

This Christmastime, keep its magic right here
Within your heart everyday of the year

Oh come back, baby
Oh mama please don't go, yeah
Cause the way I love you

And I'll be gone
So come back baby, yeah yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh now now

There's a girl in my life about 4' 10"
She's the one who brings me morning joy
And brings me joy when my day ends
She says my life will never have no problems
That her love cannot fix
Every time she goes into her love bag of tricks

She's got everything I want
Everything I need
And if she ain't got it
She knows how to find the remedy

And she tells me

[Repeat x7]
Come let me make your love come down

She says you'll never worry in your life
As long as you come and let me
Make your love come down
I call her Miss Satisfaction
Cause she keeps me satisfied
She gets my automatic smile
When she whispers Stevland, 
I love you, I love you, I love you

Such a lovely world is my life
Since that girl has come inside
And everyday that I live
I'm gonna do my best to keep her satisfied

Our love will never have no problem
That the both of us can't fix
Cause like glue to a stamp
Like gum on a shoe
She and I are gonna stick

She's got everything I want
Everything I need
And if she ain't got it
She knows how to find the remedy

And she tells me

[Repeat x7]
Come let me make your love come down

[Snoop Dogg]
Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasing fame and girls living they life on cruise control
But tell me, what do it profit a man
To gain a whole world living trife but then lose his soul?
I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreaming
Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steaming
Even though my star gleaming man my life ain't trouble-free
Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G

[Stevie Wonder]
It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leaving to conclude that for their life is not the way
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with good
Hey yeah hey

[Snoop Dogg]
So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feeling like this life is a trip
Trying to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them they can endure to the end and win

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with Good, yeah hey
Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world
Is fall in love by walks of all men and women, it's all boys and girls
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with Good

[Snoop Dogg]
Whether it's soldiers on the cell block or homies on the run
With God, man ain't no obstacles that you can't overcome

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with Good

[Snoop Dogg]
You're so frustrated, worrying 'bout your bread
And some mornings, you don't even wanna get out the bed

[Stevie Wonder]
When you lose too much too bad
Just go talk to God and pray

[Snoop Dogg]
And you's a good women, but you can't understand
Why it seems like you ain't never gon' find yourself a good man

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with Good

[Snoop Dogg]
Mothers on welfare or ladies that's stripping
You under so much pressure, feel like your sanity's slipping

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too hard!
Just go have a talk with Good,
He'll never never let you down

[Stevie Wonder (Snoop Dogg)]
You know that, don't you Snoop?
(You know I know it Uncle Steven)
Oh I know that too, we know it
(Yeah we do)
Thanks a lot man
(Nah thank you man I appreciate that, you know I love you)
And I love you for what you saying
(God bless you)

[Snoop Dogg]
And you can catch me down on my knees, asking the Lord please
Even Jes' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease
There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression
I'm asking for your protection and thanking you for your blessing
Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm trying t roll
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't asking too much
Now that's tabernacle, chuch!

'Cause there's always a flaw in the diamond
A lightning-fork crack in the pearl
A fault in the rock of the island
And it's usually shaped like a girl

I was the first one to see her
And you were the first one to fall
Like a half-drunken downhill skier
And she was the oncoming wall
Now I get that it's all gone awry
A joke I might like to take back
Wipe a bright star from the night sky
Nothing can fill in the black

I can hear you sighin'
Sayin' you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams

On the beach we're sitting
Huggin', squeezin', kissin'
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

When I'm sleep at night baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

Oh, love is so amazing (Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah)
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

When I'm sleep at night baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

Oh, love is so amazing (Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah)
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams

Yes I am cryin'
I got the blues and I don't know why
Yes I am cryin'
I got the blues and I'm so dissatisfied
Cause I've been cryin' through the night
Tears on my pillow
And I have been cryin' through the night
Weeping like a weeping pillow
From cryin' through the night
Hear me cryin' through the night

I am lonely, downhearted and sad
Cause I've lost the best woman that I ever had
To a fiend of mine

Just can't figure out how it could be
That somebody like him could take her away from me
And it's on my mind
Nearly all the time

Yes I am cryin'
I got the blues and I don't know why
Yes I am cryin'
I got the blues and I'm so dissatisfied
Cause I've been cryin' through the night
Tears on my pillow
And I have been cryin' through the night
Weeping like a weeping pillow
From cryin' through the night
Hear me cryin' through the night

Now I know just how best friends can be
Cause he made sure you knew your best was with me
And it's on my mind

Here's a lesson much greater than wealth
Keep your business to you, yourself and no one else
And your smiling eyes
Won't be cryin' like mine

Yes I am cryin'
I got the blues and I don't know why
Yes I am cryin'
I got the blues and I'm so dissatisfied
Cause I've been cryin' through the night
Tears on my pillow
And I have been cryin' through the night
Weeping like a weeping pillow
From cryin' through the night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm weeping like a weeping pillow
From cryin' through the night
Oh, oh, yeah
Hear me cryin', cryin', I'm cryin', cryin'
I'm cryin' baby, cryin' baby, yeah
Even a fool can tell
That so many tears sho' enough done fell
And pretty soon before you know
I'll have enough tears to fill a water well
Hear me cryin' through the night
Oh yeah, cryin' through the night

And it's on my mind
Nearly all the time

Yes I am cryin'
I got the blues and I don't know why
Yes I am cryin'
I got the blues and I'm so dissatisfied
Cause I've been cryin' through the night
Tears on my pillow
And I have been cryin' through the night
Weeping like a weeping pillow
From cryin' through the night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm weeping like a weeping pillow
Oh, oh, cryin' tears, cryin' tears
Through the night

There is a place 
On earth's motherland 
Where a people 
Die in bantu stands 
Manchild at eight 
Will face guns of hate 
Womanchild's fate 
Is life second rate 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
They do a dance 
Called Mbaqana jive 
Rainbow people 
Dancin' to stay alive 
After hours 
Party hand in hand 
After Shebeen 
Terror strikes again 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Dark 'n' lovely Dark 'n' lovely 
Dark 'n' lovely 
The whole planet's watchin' 
And the Sun God is watchin', too 
Hey there Botha 
Yes, we are watchin' you 
Spirits can do 
Jah will stop this reign 
Watch our world turn 
To help those in pain 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely 
Dark 'n' lovely 
Dark 'n' lovely 
Dark 'n' lovely 
Dark 'n' lovely

Put my love life right in the pocket
And dare someone to try to top it
And when you think I want to drop it
Just love me 'til I beg don't stop it

Trying to get on the inside

Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
Don't you know I do

Mrs. Jones won't you put my darling on the phone
Let me tell her
I shouldn't have left her
Cause I love her just as long as

Bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly
Little Jack Horner in the corner loves his Christmas pie

Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Let me speak to your daughter
If she gives me one more chance
I'm gonna love her like I oughta

I can't forget (I can't forget)
That lacy dress
That she used to wear for me
We'd sit under the apple tree
And I remember (I remember, I remember) that night in September
When my baby cried and cried cause

Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
I swear I do

I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed
For stringing her along
Like a playboy with a play toy
And she loved me just as strong as

Bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly (birdies love to fly)
Little Miss Muffet loves her tuffet
Babies love to cry (babies love to cry)

Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Please don't hang up that receiver
If she heard one sweet word
She'd know I would never leave her

Baby, baby, baby
She's the best
Oh the very best
Everything worth living for
Everything that I adore

Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
I swear I do

(Keita) Show me how to do like you
(Aisha) If you say please
(Keita) Please

Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping 
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say 
Before his father said hey boy get right back in that bed

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock

Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogie the best
But his mama said no
Keita's much too young to go
But his sister said please let him go so the world can see
When they saw him they said he must be crazy
Look at him he ain't nothing but a baby
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock
Show me how to do it

(Aisha) Ooh, you done broke Mama's lamp
(Keita) Uh, uh
(Aisha) Yes you did
(Keita) No I didn't

Isolated junk yard
Letting out the garbage
Eating through the core of life

Sweet fragrance irritates
In a state room death awaits
Persecute your own self-pride

Suffocate the new high
Ride the thorny mule that cries
"Dig your grave and step right in"

Like a judas pay the price
30 pieces for a ride
Here's the fire take a chew

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time

Shredded know-how give away
Species of the human race
Those funky winds of ups and downs

Hall of grit is known too well
Heaven still is your hell
Poison slowly slowly drowns

Let the devil step right in
Lucifer's your only friend
Ain't a soul go'n pity you

Hurdly over time to death
With open arms it waits I bet
Don't you wish you could reach ground?

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time

He and his wife have had problems
That he's played off like nothing's wrong
'Til he comes home from work early
Just to find the girl is gone
Oh but he gets into the cupboard
Picks out that bottle of gin
Drinks like there's no tomorrow
And decides to take a spin

No don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad

Teenager at a live party
Says, "give me one for the road"
But he's already so inebriated
If you lit a smoke he'd explode
But bartender says, "I don't think so"
Young one says, "I can deal"
Staggering out he says, "check you all later"
But I really don't think he will

No don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk, no
Don't drive drunk
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad

Gets pulled over by the law
Officer says, "hey can't you drive straight
Or have you been drinking alcohol?"

But results from the breathalyzer
Proves he's charged with D.U.I.

Down to earth once again
I've been away too long
I got lost but then I came home again
Oh where I belong

Down to earth just in time
To the love I failed to see
I gave up the dream for a change of scene
Now I'm back where I should be

Down to earth, down to earth
All that I lost I have found
What's it worth this bitter earth
Without your love around

I got lost in the crowd
That's the price I had to pay
Cause I couldn't find what I left behind
Till love showed me the way

Down to earth down to earth
All that i lost i have found
What's it worth this bitter earth
Without your love around

Welcome home little fool
And it's been a long hard time
From a world unreal to the things I feel
Well love was waiting all the time

Down to earth,down to earth
Down, Down to earth

Dream, when you're feelin' blue
Oh, dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke ring rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Oh, dream, they just might come true
You know things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

I don't care where you came from
Oh no, I don't care where you've been
All I know is that I love you
And I'm going to love you till the end (gonna love you until the end)

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before

For every hand there's a glove
For every, for every heart there should be love
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time
Don't worry, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind
(Nobody's gonna change my mind)

[Chorus]

Yes, you're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before

(Better than anyone, better than anyone)

I love you (better than anyone)
Than anyone before (better than anyone before)
A-do me right because I love you (better than anyone)
Keep coming 'cause I love you (better than anyone)

It brings a tear,
Into my eyes,
When I begin,
To realize,
I've cried so much,
Since you've been gone,
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears,
I sit and cry,
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
I know it's true
Into each life
Some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more
Why don't you
Come on home
Oh yes so I won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll
(drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby
(drown in my own tears)
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Oh, mmmmm.

First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms
 
First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

She's a Miss Beautiful Supreme
A girl that others wish that they could be
If there's seven wonders of the world
Then I know she's gotta be number one
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

She's the sunflower of nature's seeds
A girls that some men only find in their dreams
When she smiles it seems the stars all know
'Cause one by one they start to light up the sky
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

When she starts talking soft and sweet
Like birds of spring her words all seem to sing
With a rhythm that is made of love
And the happiness that she only brings
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

Ebony eyes

Everybody's talkin' at me.
I don't hear a word they're sayin',
Only the echoes of my mind.

People stoppin' starin'
I can't see the faces,
Only the shadows of their eyes.

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Thru the pourin' rain,
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes.

Bankin' off the northeast wind,
Sailin' on a summer breeze,
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone.

Everybody's talkin' at me.
I don't hear a word they're sayin',
Only the echoes of my mind.

And I won't let you leave my love behind.

Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Ooh everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah it's you I hate to lose

Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share

Evil, why have you engulfed so many hearts, evil
Evil, why have you destroyed so many minds
Leaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide

Evil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred
Evil, why have you stolen so much love
Leaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free

Evil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes, evil
Evil, before they could really grow to see
That your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Evil, why have you destroyed, you've destroyed so much of this doggone world evil
Evil, oh, why have you broken so many homes
Leaving sweet love alone and outcast of the world

See the girl with the diamonds and the shoes? yeah
She walks around like she's got nothin' to lose
Yes she's a go-getter, she's everybody's type
She's a queen of the city but she don't believe the hype
She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
'Til I wrote some letters on big bold signs

I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend of me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

See the boy with the Stevie Wonder swag?
Ain't gotta cup all the magic that he has
He's a go-getter, he's everybody's type
I'mma make it my mission, make him feel alright
He's a twelve on a ten point, rockin' out to his joint
Just say the word 'cause I can sing all night

Morale, you've lost that loving feeling
Don't talk
Close the door
You've been here before

Your shape dim
I'm an old man now
The air's thin
The walls very damp now
And if I don't go
I'll always be stuck here in this poor little room
With a view of the corner

I don't forget
Though I've grown weak now
Experience is useless
Unless you can learn
And I've never met anyone
Who used their knowledge
To avoid those mistakes made again and again

And if I don't go
I'll always be stuck here in this poor little room
With a view of the corner

You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it (baby)
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that loving feeling
Whoa, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Whoa-whoa

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And girl, you're starting to criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying (baby)
'Cause, baby, something beautiful's dying

You've lost that loving feeling
Whoa, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Whoa-whoa

Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away

Bring back that loving feeling
Whoa, that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on

Baby (baby), baby (baby)
I want you please (whoo)
Please (whoo)
I need your love (I need your love)
I need your love (I need your love)
Now it bring it on back (bring it on back)
Bring it on back, now (bring it on back, now)
Now bring it on back

Ev'rybody had a good time.
So, if you want me to, if you want me to;
I'm gonna swing this song, yeah, 
just-a one more time until I come back,
just-a one more time until I come back.

All the gold in all the world
Is nothing to possess
If all the things that it can bring
Can't add up to one ounce of your happiness

And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there

A diamond that shines
Like a star in the sky
Is nothing to behold
For minuscule is any light
If it can't like you brighten up my soul

And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there

I could have never fathomed this
Such joy, love and tenderness
That you give to me
For the love I feel inside
It's so wonderful I can't hide
And I glow, I glow
With just the thought of you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there

Frankie & Johnny were sweethearts
At least, that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes
Oh, he was a man allright,
Oh, but he was doing a-wrong
Just to show you what came happen

A friend came running to Frankie
Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arm around her waist
Oh he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was doing a-wrong
Oh let me tell you

Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long 44
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hardwood floor
Oh he was a man alright
But she shot him because he was doing a-wrong
But the last thing he told her was

Frankie, you know I love you
Why, honey why did you do that
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Frankie you know good well that I love you
Frankie I'll always love you baby
Frankie, you know I can't do without you
Frankie, you know I love you
I'm your man and I know I was doing a-wrong

Free like the river
Flowing freely through infinity
Free to be sure of
What I am and who I need not be
Free from all worries
Worries prey on oneself's troubled mind
Freer than the clock's hands
Tickin' way the times
Freer than the meaning of free that man defines
Life running through me
Till I feel my father God has called

Me having nothin'
But possessing riches more than all
And I'm free
To be nowhere
But in every place I need to be
Freer than a sunbeam
Shining through my soul
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold
Free from conceiving the beginning
For that's the infinite start

I'm gone, gone but still living
Life goes on without a beating heart

Free like a vision
That the mind of only you can see

Freer than a raindrop
Falling from the sky
Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes

I'm free like a river
Flowin' freely through infinity
I'm free to be sure of what
I am and who I need not to be
I'm much freer, like the meaning of the word free that crazy man defines
Free, free like the vision that
The mind of only you are ever gonna see
Free like the river my life
Goes on and on through infinity

I am a veteran of the war
I up and joined the army back in nineteen-sixty-four
At sixteen, I just had to be a man at any cost
I volunteered for Vietnam, where I got my leg shot off
I recall a quote form a movie that said "who's more a man
Than a man with a reason that's worth dyin' for?"

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill
To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill
They put a gun in my hand and said "shoot until he's dead"
But it's hard to kill when "please, I'm your friend" echoes through your head
Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life
But then put in the jungle where life has no price, no

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

Back in the world, the paper reads today
Another war is in the brewing
But what about the lives of yesterday?
And the many happy families that have been ruined?
My niece is a hooker and my nephew's a junkie, too
But they say I have no right to tell them how they should do
They laugh and say quit "braggin' 'bout the war you should have never been in"
But my mind is so brainwashed I'd probably go back and do it again
I walk the neighborhood, parading my purple heart
With a fear of agent orange that no one will stop, no

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

Would you believe I do?
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

Well hello there, 
My it's been a long long time
How am I doin', 
Oh well I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Mm ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love, 
I hope that he's doin' fine
Heard you told him, yes baby
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing 
That you told me
Well it seems like just the other day
Mm, ain't it funny how time slips away

Gotta go now, 
Guess I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though, oh
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time your gonna pay

Well ain't it surprisin' how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it surprisin' how time slips away

You are so unpredictable
When I am not
You are so irresistible
That I can't stop
You say my name
And I start walking on heaven

What flying saucers did you come here on
What extraterrestrial planet are you from
You're much more than life
You're from galaxy paradise

What flying saucers did you come here on
What will they say when they find that you're gone
Say you'll stay in life
Queen from galaxy paradise

You are so unforgettable
And I will not
Our love's far more than sensual
And twice as hot
You touch my hand
And I know that we'll love forever

What flying saucers did you come here on
What extraterrestrial planet are you from
You're much more than life
You're from galaxy paradise

What flying saucers did you come here on
What will they say when they find that you're gone
Say you'll stay in life
Queen from galaxy paradise

Georgia Rose, Georgia Rose,

Though we don't see quite right, cause you're skin's dark as night.

Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else

She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But its high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me

Some think that diamond rings; fancy cars
Will make a big impression
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
Cause she still says

That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will

No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I know that I will be the one who will

Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

Miss Lady Girl
Has buried her feelings deep inside
Cause she don't want
To be taken for another ride

She's sick and tired
Of being on that lonely merry-go-round
She just don't know
That the ultimate love of her life is about to be found

They think that ready cash, flashy clothes
Will her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say

That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will

No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I know that I will be the one who will

Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

Hello morning, good, good morning to the one I love
Crystal ringlets paint a picture of a gold sunrise above

Little girl you're sad
Though all you have
Is visible to you
Within your heart
There stays a part
That like the sky is blue

Shifting breezes, grace the inner spectrum of your glance
Leaves on branches, for your pleasure, perform a soothing dance

Little girl it seems
In all my dreams
Your happiness is due
But still they last
Their in your past
Events that make you blue

Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try

In an instant there'll be sunshine
Sprinkled every place
Drops of rain will kiss the softness of your lovely face

Little girl be fair
Show yourself you care
Let others care for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
Till your heart's no longer blue

Little girl be smart
Don't break your own heart
There is love waiting for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
Til your heart's no longer blue

Spring will come to those who seek it
Love belongs to those who speak it
And in awhile you're sure to smile
If you give your heart a chance

Joy is not beyond achieving
If you're not beyond believing
True faith you'll find if you look in your mind
If you only give your heart a chance

True faith you'll find if you look in your mind
If you only give your heart a chance

Her parents said, girl don't leave home
But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home 

Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so who'll pay your fare
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home 

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word, my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home
Go home baby, you better go home right now
Go home, little girl you better go home

Then that's got shall get, 
Them that's not shall loose, 
So the Bible said and it still is news.
Mama may have, papa may have, 
But God bless the child that's got his own,
That's got his own.

Well the strong gets more,
While the weak ones fade,
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade.
Mama may have, papa may have, 
But God bless the child that's got his own,
That's got his own. 

Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding round your door 
When it's gone and spending ends
They don't come round no more

Rich relations give 
Crusts of bread and such 
You can help yourself 
But don't take too much 
Mama may have, papa may have, 
But God bless the child that's got his own,
That's got his own.

Looking in your eyes
Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
'Cause I'm not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away

Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance
Just to hold your hand

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're a dream come true
There's no way that I'll be losing

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're my dream come true
There is no way that I'll be losing

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there

Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
Gone too soon

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say, "She told me so"
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her - on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her - on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know, I just love her so?
She's my little woman, waitin' all this time
Babe, I'm a little fool for you, little girl

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom bom
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
Now I see there's joy inside your arms

Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life

And I am happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
Ever since the day you came inside of my life

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom I love you

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom I love you

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

I'm happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom bom bom bom

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bom bom I love you

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom

Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

I'm happier than the stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside of my life

I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world
The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should never be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
We know the key to unity all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago (happy birthday)
That lives in all of the hearts of people (happy birthday)
That believe in unity (happy birthday)
We'll make the dream become a reality (happy birthday)
I know we will (happy birthday)
Because our hearts tell us so (happy birthday)
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday

There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if your's you cannot find
You should talk it over to Him
He'll give you peace of mind
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to him anytime He's always around
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

My nights are so long
As I watch each hour go by
Hoping and praying
That someday I will be your guy

Hey love
You're my one true soul desire
Hey love, baby
Can you feel this burning fire

Hey love
There's one thing I find so true
When you are near me
I go through a change or two
Hearing your footsteps
I hurry to catch your eye
And I stand there waiting, yeah
But girl, you just walk on by

Say love
With a cold heart you are dealing
Hey love, yeah
It's an awful hurting feeling

Hey love
Don't pass me without some sign
Just look me over, yeah
I want to change your mind

People keep on learnin'
Soldiers keep on warrin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long

Powers keep on lyin'
While your people keep on dyin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long

I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground

Lovers keep on lovin'
Believers keep on believin'
Sleepers just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground

Woo!

God is gonna show you higher ground

Hold me darling hold me
And I'll always be your, be your guy 
Closer, baby come closer 
Let me be the one that loves and be by your side 

Why should you be lonely when I need you so 
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go 
So hold me, baby hold me 
Say you'll never let me go 

Why should you be lonely when I need you so 
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go 
So hold me, baby hold me 
Say you'll never let me go 

You know I love you so 
I'll never-never let you go 
I'll never let you go 
Oh baby-baby, hold me 
Why should we be apart 
I'll never-never let you go

There was a girl I used to know 
She was oh so beautiful 
But she's not here anymore 
She had a college degree 
Smart as anyone could be 
She had so much to live for 
But she fell in love 
With the wrong kinda man 

He abused her love and treated her so bad 
There was not enough education in her world 
That could save the life of this little girl 

How come, how long 
It's not right, it's so wrong 
Do we let it just go on 
Turn our backs and carry on 
Wake up, for it's too late 
Right now, we can't wait 
She won't have a second try 

Open up your hearts 
As well as your eyes 
She tried to give a cry for help 
She even blamed things on herself 
But no one came to her aid 
Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell 
That's what we'd like to tell ourselves 

But no, it wasn't that way 
So she fell in love 
With the wrong kinda man 
And she paid with her life 
For loving that man 
So we cannot ignore, 
We must look for the signs 
And maybe next time we could save somebody's life

Don't wanna believe what they're telling me
Somebody's been pickin' in my cherry tree
Don't wanna mistrust nobody by mistake
But I hear tell someone's been diggin' round in my cake 
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
Nah-ah (nah-ah)
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
Nah-ah (nah-ah nah-ah) nah-ah (nah-ah nah-ah) 
Don't wanna believe what somebody said
But somebody said somebody's shoes was under my bed
Don't wanna cause nobody no bodily harm
But somebody's been rubbin' on my good luck charm 
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
Nah-ah (nah-ah)
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
Nah-ah (nah-ah nah-ah) nah-ah (nah-ah nah-ah) 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
No, I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby, nah-ah (nah-ah)
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby, no
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no (nah-ah)
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby, nah-ah (nah-ah) oh, oh, oh
(I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Stand for it baby, nah-ah (nah-ah) baby, ah, ah

Shattered dreams, worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began, then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well

The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end
And with the strength we have won't be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever

God surely answered my prayer
God surely answered by prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
God always will answer your prayers
Believe in one who will answer my prayer
Thank you God (I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever)

Come on, let's fall in love
You're the woman I've been waiting for
Come on, let's fall in love
You're the girl that I really adore
Come on, let's fall in love (don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna fall in love with me)
Come on baby, let's fall in love
Come on let's fall in love

I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues, yeah, yeah

I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues, yeah, yeah, yeah

I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues

[Chorus]
I can't let my heaven walk away;
Just can't let my heaven walk away.
Just gotta find a way to make her stay.
I don't know what I've done wrong.
Look up and find my heaven gone.

Called her name, but I called in vain.
I know she can't answer from a picture frame.
Only an hour ago, I held her in real flesh and blood.
She just grabbed her coat and said: "please, I've had enough."
She kept me well like a Sunday prayer.
Just like my own right hand, the girl was always there.
To every man but me, her eyes were blind.
I was in the promised land long before my time.

[Chorus]

I accused my baby of being a liar.
I said the flesh is weak in God's key trial.
I only asked her to hear her tell me no,
But my question back-fired; I didn't expect her to go.

[Chorus x 2]

I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
But I love you

Always treat me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down that's your rule
I don't know why I love you 
But I love you 

Oh you never stop your 
Cheatin' ways with another guy 
You laugh in my face
Lord how long must I be disgraced

Cause I love you 
Oh baby, baby, baby
I don't know why I love you 
I don't know 

You and me baby, oh
I don't know why I love you baby 
But I love you baby 
Oh darlin', darlin', darlin'

You throw my heart down in the dirt
You made me crawl on 
This cold black earth, baby
No I never, I never knew 

How much love could hurt
Until I loved you baby
'Til I loved you baby, baby
Oh baby, I can't stop 

I can't stop crying can't you see
Here I'm pleadin' on my knees
I'm on my knees
Won't you help me, help me please

Cause I love you, I love you baby
Sure enough, baby, yeah
I don't know, you don't know
We don't know none of us

Can't do nothing about it
I don't know, I don't know
Oh baby, I don't know, I don't know
Nobody can do nothing about it

Got no place to be
No one's needing me
My girl just said we?re through
Love was here to stay
Only yesterday
Today my world is blue
So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on.
I gotta have a song
To go it alone.
A happy happy song
Had a happy home
Now it's turned to stone
Kitchen's cold and bare
She'd cook all day for me
I still hurry home to see
But I know that she's not there
So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on.
I gotta have a song
To go it alone.
A happy happy song
Show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music, I just can't go wrong
I gotta have a song.
To go it alone
A happy happy song

You've given me a true love and ev'ry day I thank you love,
For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.
Whenever you are near, I Hear A Symphony, 
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms.
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine.
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.
Oo love me.  
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby.
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within, 
Don't let this feeling end, 
Let it go on and on and on now baby.
 
Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes, 
I care not for myself but for those 
Who've never felt the joy we've felt.
Whenever you are near,
I Hear A Symphony each time you speak to me 
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love.
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me 
Whispering how much you care,
A thousand violins fill the air now.
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end,
Keep standing close to me,
Oo so close to me, baby, baby.
 
Baby, baby, I Hear A Symphony, a tender melody.
Ah it goes on and on and on and on and 
on and on and on and on and 
on and on and on and on and

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, of my heart

I know that you've been good to me
And I know it's just a rumor spreading in this town
And I know know know it's a thing I don't believe
Cuz you know I'd never let you down baby
This is love that you see on my face
And it's impossible to erase
Still it scares me when I hear what I hear
You see, everybody's talking and they whisper in my ear

But I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
Cuz nothing's gonna stop our love
(Honey don't you see?)

I know about their jealousy
And I know about the talk that's growing in this town
And I know know know that they don't want to believe
That I'm not just a run-around baby
They say we will break up, just you wait
They gamble on the time and the date it will end
Not much longer, they swear
You see everybody's talking, I hear rumors everywhere

But I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
Cuz nothing's gonna stop our love
(Honey don't you see?)


I don't believe what they think of you and me
When they say that we're in trouble
Cuz they don't know what they're talking about
It's just too bad we've got what they've never had
So they just stay busy talking
"She don't love him, he don't love her!"

But I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
Cuz nothing's gonna stop our love
(Honey don't you see?)

I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real big heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
Cuz nothing's gonna stop us

My song is a serious matter
It reflects what i feel
If i say i love you, i mean it
`cause in my song
Every line is for real

Every man or woman
Enjoys going home
To a peaceful situation
To give love and receive love
Without any complications

Whether my tune is short or long
Whether my lyrics are weak or strong

I like to live the love
That i sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That i sing about in my song

Music is love
And my love is music
In perfect harmony
So when i sing
I have sung all about
The love of you and me

I never got angry with my guitar
`cause when i strike a chord
It gives me what i want to hear
So i'm finding out that
We are quite like my song together, my dear

Outside answers
Should always be forbidden
Problems should be solved
And never hidden

I like to live the love
That i sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That i sing about in my song

Though they say you're not my friend
You've been here through thick and thin
And for that little girl I love ya
And all I want to do is talk about ya

I'm here to say
I love you more each day
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so

Though they put me down because
I love you as much as I do
But they don't know what you've done for me
You've made such a happy man out of me

And I'm here to say
Love you everyday, yeah
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so

Baby (I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing)
About you baby
Oh yeah (I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing)
Everything about you baby, mm yeah

Though they say that I am wrong
'Cause my love is strong
There's only one that I place above you
It's God that I place above you

Girl I just want to say
Love you more each day, yeah
I just want to tell the world
That I love you so, yeah

Some folks say that it's strange
But my whole life you have changed
You've saved all the pain the world's put on me
All I wanna do is talk about you and I'm here to say
Love you everyday, yeah yeah
Telling everybody that
I love you so, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah

(I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby)
Yeah yeah yeah
(I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby)
Everything about you baby (everything about you)
Oh yeah (I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby)

You know I love, I love ever' lit' thing, about you babe

Everything baby, baby, baby, baby (about you baby)
Every damn thing about you baby
(I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby)
I love everything about you, hey, uh, oh (about you)

(Mm, sugar, cookie, puddin', oh yeah, candy, all right)
(An' big ol' piece of cake)

I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
I pity the fool
You know I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people

What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

You know I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh I pity the fool

Hey!

I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone
And I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
And I wanna make her love me till the fire don't burn
And I wanna make her love me till the world cease to turn

Oh papa, I'm like a little lost lamb
Reaching for a girl that's out of reach
Ah, sit right down and talk to me man to man
Tell me how to practice what you used to preach
Oh, papa used to tell me that a man could do
Anything he ever put his heart into

But I wanna make her love me till them seas run dry
And I wanna make her love me till money can't buy
I wanna make her love me till the fifth week in May
And I wanna make her love me till Ol' Man River runs away

Oh, she's a ditty and as pretty as Mona Lisa
Papa's rich and her mama's proud
I worked three jobs tryin' to get what might please her
But still she lives in a world where I ain't allowed
Ah papa, you used to tell me it might take a little sweat
But when a man wakes up he sure enough will get

I wanna make her love me till the kingdom come
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
I gonna make her love me till right is wrong

Ah Hey, yeah Hey

Ah, I can't compete with Baby Face Pete
And I ain't no match for Lou
He gave her a diamond, a diamond ring the other week
And all I can give her is a heart so true
Oh, papa used to say a true heart will reign
What a true heart desires it sure enough will gain

But I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
I gonna make her love me till it snows in June
Hey, hey, save on my baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ow...

Tossing and turning all night long
My girl is gone, can't take it
I'm trying to conceal the loneliness I feel
But it's real, can't fake it
The pain in my heart is tearing me apart
Her memory, can't shake it
I tried to tell myself to find somebody else
But my heart, won't make it

Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)

(I, want my baby back)
She's the only girl that brightens up my world
What can I say, don't make her do it
She's fine as can be and was so good to me
I had a good thing, and I blew it
Now I'm all alone, the love we had is gone
What can I do, to renew it
If I only had a chance to continue our romance
I wouldn't hestiate, to get to it

Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact
And more than anything I want my sugar back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah yeah
(I, want my baby back)

Ah ah ah, ah ah I need love and that's a natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah I, want my baby back
My heart is aching, think it's breaking
Ah ah, ah ah I want my baby back
My world is lonely, need her only
Everybody sing I want my baby back now
(I want my baby back)
Ha ha ha, ha ha I, want my baby back
My heart is sadly...

I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her"
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby love me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
And that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah hey hey hey
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Oo baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey

Every night I say a prayer
Before I go to sleep
Suddenly you were there
Your face so fine, your voice so sweet
In these arms of mine
I found you just in time
In this turn of the world
I was a lost and lonely girl
But then a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)
I know (yes I know)

Funny how my empty heart
Used to feel like a heavy load
Suddenly you were there
Like a friend on a lonesome road
Right into these arms of mine
I found you, I found you just in time
'Cause I was a lonely man
Holding out my helpless hand
Then a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)

Our time is here now
Now matter how the world is around
In your arms I find
Some kind of love and peace of mind
'Cause a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)

Look in your eyes
And I see the lies
But in my mind
It's a mystery
Feeling the pain
And I feel the love
And once again
You're the world to me

Hey, what is this thing I'm feeling, baby
What are these strange emotions
Loving the pleasure sweetly
Loving the pain as deeply

It's almost midnight
And  my love is coming down
Lots of ladies love me
But it's still a lonesome town

(Very special love
Very special love affair)
(Very special love
Very special love affair)

You've got me looking for love
Though you're my sole desire
Looking for love and a girl for me
You've got me looking for love
And  my soul's on fire
Looking for love and a girl for me

Memories of our love obsesses me
Thoughts of us are sending all the time
If I gave into your soul, my dear
Then you really never could be mine
Very, very loving day

Think of you every day, think of you all kinds of way
Very special love
Very special love
Very special love
Very special love
Very special love
Very special love
Very special love
Very special love
Very special love, very special, very special love

When I think of Tom.
I think of a night,
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white,
The soft mist of England
Was sleeping on a hill.

I remember this,
And I always will
There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill,
Looking on the same blue sea.
And I know Tom and I are a part of them all 
And they're all a part of Tom an me.

Hello young lovers, whoever you are,
I hope your troubles are few.
All my good wishes go with you tonight,
I've been in love like you.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels,
And to fly down the street in a trance.
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet,

And you meet, not really by chance.

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do,
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight,
I've had a love of my own.
I've had a love of my own, like yours
I've had a love of my own.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels,
And to fly down the street in a trance.
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet,
And you meet, not really by chance.

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do,
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight,
I've had a love of my own.
I've had a love of my own, like yours
I've had a love of my own.

I guess I'd have to say this album is
Dedicated to you.
Although perhaps you may not be happy,
This is what you want,
So I conceded.
I hope it makes you happy.
There's a lot of truth in it, babe.

I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby.
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby.
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line.
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us.
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine.

So here it is, babe.
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy,
Think about the kisses and the joy.
But there were those other moments too,
The times that were cloudy and grey.
Bad.
But you taught me that was life.
May love ever protect you,
May peace come into your life.
Always think of me the way I was.
Ha, I was your baby.

This is what you wanted.
Here, dear, here it is.
Here, my dear, here it is.

Why should I feel so discouraged
I wanna know why should the shadow come
Oh tell me why why should I feel lonely, so lonely
And long for heaven and a home

Since Jesus is my portion
A constant friend he is
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches over me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches over me

I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know Jesus watches me

And my life, life, my life seems dark as night, ooh
Then I ask baby, I'll ask, I'll ask, please
Oh, oh please, please be my guiding light
Won't you be, be my guiding light?

You know I get such a strange sensation
Every time I hear your name
Now all of my friends and my relations
They say I'm loving you, loving you in vain, yeah, yeah

Snuggle, snuggle, snu-snuggle on my shoulder, baby
Come on and tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me you care, darling
Oh, as our love, our love, our love, our love grows older, baby
Ooh, tell me that the flame, the flame, oh, baby will still be there
That the flame, flame will still be

Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna hold you, baby
Never let you go, now what you gotta say?
Hold me, baby, yes I will, darling
I'll love to remember it darling, yeah, yeah
Hold me, I'm gonna hold you in my arms
I know, I know, I know, baby

They ask me to forget about you
Go out and find someone new
But that won't be eas', you see
After all the things you've done for me
Told the men I ain't too proud to say
With you I stand tall and strong
'Cause without you, girl, I'm nothin' at all

How, how can I forget ya?
After all you've done for me
Oh woman, you'll always be a part of me
I, I can't forget you
It's impossible, you see
Woman, you'll always be a part of me

Girl, I'm down on my bended knees
And I'm beggin' you please, beggin' you please
Woman, woman, don't set me free
'Cause right this moment in the sun
My life was wastin' away
Girl, your love gave me hope and strength
You're the reason I'm alive today
Girl, you don't realize what your love means to me
It's more precious than the evergreens

How, how can I forget ya?
After all you've done for me
Oh woman, you'll always be a part of me
I, I can't forget you
It's impossible, you see
Woman, you'll always be a part of me

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you? 
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel to be where you are
How far is the journey from here to a star?

And if I left you, how much would I cry? 
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs 
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion 
Deeply touching my emotion 
I want to stop and thank you baby 
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night, 
Wondering where would I be without you in my life 
Everything I did was just a bore, 
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you 
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better for me than I was for myself 
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby 
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you 
How sweet it is to be loved by you

How you going to keep it after you get it?
I want to know, sugar darling, yeah
How you going to keep it after you get it?
Oh baby
Sweet thing

Now I think of games sometimes
But when it comes to this heart of mine
I don't miss a bus
If you ain't got the right stuff
So I'm laying it on the line
And it's something you'd best be mine
Don't fight the fire without the words to give it up

Oh how you going to keep it after you get it?
Oh tell me sugar, tell me sugar
How you going to keep it after you get it?
I want to know right now

Listen, your sweet talking sure sound good
And your kissing satisfied
And when you hold me in your arms
I get weak, I won't deny
But I'm not in for a one-night thrill
You've got to have enough love to pull us all over the hill

Oh how you going to keep it?
I want to know
How you going to keep it?
I want you to think, think about it baby
Stop and start yourself
Don't let your mind ruin your heart
Is what you're laying on me fake
Or have you really got what it takes?

Oh how you going to keep it?
I want to know
How you going to keep it?
If I let you be careful with my ship
How you going to keep it?
I want to know, will you be able to hold your grip?
How you going to keep it?
When hard times come, (tell me about it) honey, would you pack up your bags and run?
How you going to keep it?
Sweet thing now, how you going to keep it?
I want to know
How you going to keep it?
I want to know
How you going to keep it?
And I want to know
How you going to keep it?

No, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before(not like before)

You don't kiss me like you used to
You don't say those pretty words
There's no thrill in your kiss, there's no sincerity
I do believe you've gotten over me

That's why,can't believe you love me
No,no I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before (not like before)

(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
Anymore, not like before (not like before)

Whenever we're together, not a word do you say
When I speak your name in sweestiest tone
It's as though I'm all alone

I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe you love me
I can't believe you love me

Ooh it's so good, it's so good

Ooh I'm in love, I'm in love,

You and me

Ooh I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love

I feel love
I feel love

I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind

Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind

Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah

Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah yeah

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you

And you're were long meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say, "We'll never part"

I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight

Je t'aime toi
Pour raisons sentimentales
J'espere que tu me crois
Je t'ai donne mon coeur

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I met a little girl, sure was fine;
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind.
She took me home, and, ahh, made love to me.
I knew right then and there, this is where I wanted to be.
Most of my life I had been all, all alone,
And you're so sweet to me; don't think I'll ever roam.
And then one day as time will pass,
I had this feeling that our love would last.
Nothing could go wrong, and it seemed everything I did 
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid.
Then one night after we made it, and we were through,
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you.
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife;
To love, hold, and cherish, for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin',
Cause I love you.
Nineteen sixty-four.
Once you really loved me,
Once I really loved you.
Nineteen seventy-six.
Then time would change you ,
As time would really change me.
We thought our love would stand the test of time,
And, as I sing this song, right now, I wonder today, today,
If you're a friend of mine.
Cry, cry, cry, I have done some crying.
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow.
Cry, cry, cried; you cry about me?
Do you think about the kind of love we had?
Hal, le, hallelejah. 
Hal, le, lu, I'm free.
Hal, le, hallelejah.
Hal, le, lu, I'm free.

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

You don't have to worry cause I'm comin'
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough, love, for me stay

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
 
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
Anywhere you are, oh oh
I wanna wanna be where you are, oh oh
Everywhere you are, oh oh

Please, don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
 
(Oooh!!)
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
Any, any, anywhere you are, oh oh
I wanna wanna be where you are, oh oh
I gotta be where you are, oh oh

I wanna be...
I wanna be... oh, oh
Yeah yeah, baby now
I wanna be...
I wanna be... oh., oh
Oooh
I wanna be...
I wanna be... ohoh
Now, now, yeah baby
Oooh
I wanna be...
I wanna be.. ohoh
Yeah, yeah, baby now
Oooh

I want you uh uh uh

I want you, the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me, too 9to want me, too)
Want you to want me baby (want you to want me baby)
Just like I want you

Oh, I'll give you all the love
I want in return, sweet darling
But half the love is all I feel
Ooh, it's too bad it's just too sad
You don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, aw baby

I want you, the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me, too
I want you to want me baby
Just like I want you

One way love is just a fantasy, oh suggar!
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with somethin'
You should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you want to care
Baby, lonely out there

I want you (the right way)
I want you
But I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
When I get down with you, get down, get down baby
Listen precious, I want you a lot of times

I want you, I want, I want, yeah, oh baby
I want you, the right way, baby
I want you, baby
But I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Oh the way that I love you
I want you

I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have faded long ago.
I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why must your kiss torture me as long as this.

I might be smilin' by now 
With some new tender friend.
Smilin' by now
With my heart on the mend.

But when I try
Something in that heart says "No".
You're still there
I wish I didn't love you so.

I won't cry anymore, now that you've left me
I won't cry anymore, now that you're gone
I've shed a million tears since we're apart
But tears can never mend a broken heart

I won't sigh anymore, I'll just forget you
And I'm closing the door of memories
Though you're the one love that my arms are longin' for
This is goodbye, I won't cry anymore

I wonder
Well, well, well, little darling
Where can you be
This moonlit night
Are you holding someone tight
I wonder
My heart is aching
I'm a fool to let it go on breaking
Maybe I'll awake and find that I'm mistaken
I wonder
I wonder
I've been through Lovers Lane
There's nothing there for me only rain
You've been traveling but will it last
While I'm traveling nowhere fast
I wonder
I wonder
Well, well, well, little darling
If this new love dies
Where will you be
Will your heart come running back to me
I wonder

I'll be around,
No matter how
You treat me now
I'll be around from now on.

Your latest love
Can never last,
And when its past,
I'll be around when he's gone

Good-bye again,
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then,
Oh drop a line to say you `re feeling fine

And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see
You're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone.

Good-bye again,
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then,
Oh drop a line to say your feeling fine

And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see
You're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone.

There's a spark inside my heart
That sets my soul on fire and keeps the flame inside me
Oh burning Marvin

Baby, just like the glow from out the night
When you're near, I feel all right
Somethin' inside me keeps me yearnin', oh baby

I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

Near to you, I'm sure I'll rhyme
Every dream that's passed through my mind
Simply because your love makes me believe

Near to you, I feel so strong
And I know I can right any wrong
Lovin' you gives me the power that I always need

I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

Oh baby, right from the start, you showed you cared
Every moment that we ever shared
Has brought me one step closer, oh to you
That one day, honey, since we met
Have you surely one reason to regret?
Givin' my love to you, dear, and I'll never leave you

I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no
Tammi, I'll never stop, stop
No no no no
I'll never stop lovin' you, no no no no

I'm just a weary soul
I got nowhere to go
Where I can ease my mind
Nowhere can peace I find
I have a troubled mind
Worried all the time
They call me crazy eyes
Cause I can't keep from crying

I walked the longest mile
For the darkest while
And it killed my heart
To see my people down
They call me crazy eyes
I have a troubled mind
And a cardboard sign
And a jug of wine
But I'll be alright
If I can make it through the night

Say can you spare some change
I'm not the dangerous type
Just a hard-hit friend
With an empty pipe
And when the morning comes
I struggle in the light
But I'll be alright
If I can just get high
Said I'll be alright
If I can just get high

Take a look at my crazy eyes
Mama say if I'll be alright
Ooh ooh ooh
Take a look at my crazy eyes
Mama say if I'll be alright
Hey hey hey

I'm just a weary soul
I got nowhere to go
Where I cane ease my mind
Nowhere can peace I find
I have a troubled mind
Worried all the time
They call me crazy eyes
Cause I can't keep from crying

Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet

I'm yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet

Listen, your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet

Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet and you hold my string, I'm your puppet

Darling, darling, pull the strings, let me sing you a song any day
I'm your puppet baby, you can sing for me all night long

Honey, yeah

Dreams of you, dreams of you
Are so fine, so fine, baby
Since I woke up
So is my state of mind

Since we've been apart, baby
God has healed my heart
Used to go out looking for love
Now love is looking for me
And sweet music keeps me happy

Not so long ago, darling, I was feeling sad
Who would've kissed my lips
I would've still felt bad, ah baby

There were times I've wondered if I was insane
Ah baby, I simply let my tear drop fall like rain
Oh baby, but when I kiss your lips
The clouds begin to roll away
Uh, down to my finger tips
I feel the happiness each day

Oh, my Mama said to me
She told me, son love goes where you take it
So, stay with the spirit, boy
I feel that you gonna make it, yeah

Got me wondering, yeah
Cause music's been my therapy
Taking the pain from all my anatomy
Music has never let me down
It's my symphony, always stayin' in me

Who'd know that the world ain't right, ah baby
Lots of people uptight
I'll go crazy if something ever happened to my musical thrill
And darling your love is just like music

Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a happy day
Music makes the clouds roll by, baby
Your music kissed my tears and set my eyes

Your music makes me want to sing
Your music is a joy to bring
Music is my heart and soul
It's more precious than gold

You're like a song in my heart
I love every part
A song, you're like a song
Happiness today is just a song away, just a song

I love your music, baby
I don't worry 'bout a thing
Oh, turn on your music, baby
See my happiness beam

Your love is music
Oh my darling, yeah
Your love is music, ah baby, yeah
And music is my life

Turn on some music more
Hey, turn on some music more
I got my music, hey, hey
I love my music, hey
We need the music

I got my music, hey
I love the music, oh
Turn on some music
Get off the music, ah
Turn up the music
Let's have the music, ha

Oh, if I could build my whole world around you, darling
First I'd put heaven by your side
Pretty flowers would grow wherever you walk, honey
And over your head would be the bluest sky
Then I'd take every drop of rain
And wash all your troubles away
I'd have the whole world wrapped up in you, darling
And that would be alright, oh yes it will

If I could build my whole world around you
I'd make your eyes the morning sun
I'd put so much love where there is sorrow
I'd put joy where there's never been none
Then I'd give my love to you
For you to keep for the rest of your life
Oh, and happiness would surely be ours
And that would be alright, oh, yes it would

Do-do-do-doo-doo
Do-do-do-doo-doo
Do-do-do-doo-doo
Do-do-do-doo-doo

Oh, If I could build my whole world around you
I'd give you the greatest gift any woman could possess

And I'd step into this world you created
And give you a true love and tenderness
And there'd be something new with every tomorrow
To make this world better as days go by

That is, if I could build my whole world around you
If I could build my whole world around you
That would be all right, oh yeah

If I could build my whole world around you
If I could build my whole world around you
Then that would be all right, oh yeah

If I could just build my world, baby
If I could build it, build it, all around you

Oh, If I should die tonight
Oh baby, though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar, yeah
'Cause I've known you ('cause I've known you)

Ooh, oh, how many eyes
Have seen their dream
Oh, how many arms
Have felt their dream
How many hearts, baby
Have felt their world stand still?

Ooh
Millions never, they never, never
And millions never will, baby
They never will

Whoo, If I should die tonight (if I should die tonight, love)
Darlin', it would be far before my time
I won't die blue
'Cause I've known you

Oooh
Grateful that you're here
Grateful that you're lovin' me, my desire
Is to love you 'till I'm no longer here
And never tire
Love has been so good to me, me now
I'm so thankful

Ooh, oh, how many eyes
Have seen their dream (seen their dream)
How many arms
Have held their dream (held their dream)
How many hearts, oh darlin'
Have felt their world stand still
Oh Lord

Oh, millions never, no, never-never
And millions never will, sugar
They never will

If I should die tonight, ah baby
I just want you to keep this one thought in mind
That I would never die blue
'Cause I've known you

I could write a million letters
Quote from every poem I've read
Sing each I've song that I've ever heard to you

But there's one thing I'd do better
If I had a voice instead
And the part of me that holds my love for you

If my heart could sing
I'd sing a song that all the world could feel
One that each word a thought would bring
If my heart could sing, sing

I'd sing of love to tell my story
A how love brought me you
And like a bell I'd toll and ring
If my heart could sing

There are things I'd like to tell you
Things I'd felt along the way
But my lips can't speak the magic words
That my heart alone can say

Oh, I'd prove to you I'll always love you
Girl, I will, till the end of time
I'll make you today eternal spring
If my heart could sing

There are things that I'd like to tell you
Like how I'll never, ever forget you
If my heart, my heart could only sing, sing, sing

If this world were mine, I'd place at your feet
All that I own, you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
For with your love inside me, that would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
With wealth untold, you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me

And whoah, you're my inspiration
Yeah, I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me, whoah

Every sky would be blue
Long as you're lovin' me

Whoa-oa-oah, with you here in my arms life is so wonderful

Whoa-oa-oah, give me plenty lovin', baby
Give me plenty lovin', honey
Keep on lovin' me
Whoa-oa-oah, you know I need you, baby
Reall-really need you, honey

Dah, dah, dah

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply cause we wear our hair long

Lady luck shows my love me
Oh, when she blessed me with your loving charms
I've found my place in the sun
With heaven right here in your arms

I feel so lucky, so lucky baby
Oh, lucky to be loved by you
And I wanna thank you, thank you baby
For all the little loving things you do

I got to tell the world about it
I've got to stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me

Ooh baby, ooh baby

I don't mind stormy weather
The rain no longer makes me blue
And I don't care when my friends all get together
And leave me out of everything they do

It's alright if the sun don't shine
It's impossible to darken my day
Makes no difference if I don't have a dime
I'll be wealthy anyway

Mmm, I'm no good without you
But listen baby, as long as I got you
Hey, look at lucky me, hey, ooh baby

In my life, there's no misfortune
No struggle or strife today
You're my lucky charm, my guiding star
So just smile and chase them blues away

I can't help it baby, you're so wonderful
Oh, how lucky can a-one man be
Oh, your tenderness and sweet caress
And it all belongs to me

I wanna tell the world about it
I wanna stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me

The ridahs, the ladies, the playas and the macks 
Now this is what I want ya'll to do for me, 
Kick back and blaze one up to this shit. 

Ya'll know who the fuck I am, 
But if ya don't

Yes I am 
I'm S, N Double O, P 
Hell yeah baby 
Snoopy Snoopy 
Sing it girls 
Say my name Bitch

Whoa, I was a fool from the start
Fooling around with my mind instead of my heart
I was young and fine and you plucked me clean
Oh but you didn't know that, I didn't know that
You didn't know what I mean

You know you had a brother who thought he was cool
But really, I was a dumb little fool
You said you'd never, never go away
And stay beside me night and day
You said you would love and obey
Well you should, well you should
It can only get you good

I was a dumb little fool
I was a dumb little fool
But I'll never get enough get enough
Enough of that funky stuff
I'm gonna jump back in
Up to my neck again

You always knew that I
Wasn't that kind of guy
All the times I thought you knew
Well I was busy loving you
What was you afraid to lose
Everybody's got to choose

I don't know if I'm gonna get a yeah or neh
Or if I'm gonna do what his honor says

(Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous
Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous)

But if I decide, baby, what you want
I wanna know
If you would be satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Would you be satisfied
Satisfied

Is that enough, baby
Is that enough
Last you a lifetime
Is that enough
Is that enough
Keep you happy
Is that enough
You know I do it
And I know that you just love
That expensive stuff

You got a flair for style
And the style is all the while
What could I do
The judge said she got to keep on living
The way she accustomed to
She trying to break a man
I don't understand
Somebody tell me please, tell me please
Why do I have to pay attorney fees (My baby's)
Attorney fees (Ooh baby)
This is a joke
I need a smoke
Wait a minute

One can have a dream, baby
Two can make a dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can see how it really feels

One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make a light shine through

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby,
Me and you
You know it takes two

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Make a dream come true
It just takes two

One can have a broken heart
Living in misery
Two can really ease the pain
Like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar,
Like an island he's all alone
Two can make just any place
Seem just like bein' at home

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you
It just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby,
To make a dream come true
It just take two

Just takes two
Just takes two

One can go out to a movie
Looking for a special treat
Two can make that single movie
Something really kind of sweet
And one can take a walk in the moonlight
Thinking that's it's really nice
But two lovers walking hand in hand
Is like adding just a pinch of spice

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you
Just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true

World, I'm not the same.
I can't remember my name half the time.
I took a walk, I thought I'd get some air
But was really not aware of what I said or what I did.
I never see the dark of night or the light of day.
I took a walk into the park and never saw the children play.
Everything I see is a crazy kind of mystery to me.
I'm flirting with the mother of insanity.
Oh, babe, where is my mind?
Since you left me it's been hard to find.
Oh where, where is my mind?
It started to rain, and I felt insane,
But one thing's for sure:
It's going to rain forever more
Until you come back to me.
Please, babe
World, I'm not the same.
I go somewhere and can't remember how I came.
I'm completely turned around, lost in space.
It's your face I see constantly.
I never know from right or wrong, or anything.
I'm like a desperate man,
Just see me try to cling
To the only other parts you've left to me.
I'm flirting, I'm flirting with uncertainty.
Oh, bring back my mind.
Since you left me, honey,
I can't find it.
Oooh, honey, bring back my mind.
I'm starting to say 
More and more every day.
Please release my soul.
Give me back control of my mind.
Only you can save me.

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

It's phony it's plain to see
How happy I would be
If you believed in me

Honey, your love is gone, I know your love is gone
It's a desperate situation
Now I'm all alone, I'm all alone
It's a desperate situation

I'm without happiness, without tenderness
Without the love we used to share
I spend eternity reliving memories
'Cause the truth is just too much to bear

Now that you don't love me, you love someone new
Death could be no worse than what I've been going through
Girl, this life of mine is just a waste of time
It's a desperate situation

Oh, it's a lonely world without your loving, girl
It's a desperate situation

I'm a dreamer now, just a dreamer now
'Cause it hurts so much when I awake
But in dreams of you, girl there's no-one new
I'm still the only man you take

Night after night I lay staring at the ceiling
Wondering where you are, who you're with and what you'refeeling
Oh, I've been forgotten, Lord knows I can't forget
It's a desperate situation

Oh, this foolish heart of mine still loves you, yeah
It's a desperate situation
Oh, come back, baby
Come save me, baby

Night after night I lay staring at the ceiling
Wondering where you are, who you're with and what you'refeeling
Oh, I've been forgotten, Lord knows I can't forget
It's a desperate situation

Oh, this foolish heart of mine still loves you, yeah
It's a desperate situation
Oh, this life of mine is just a waste of time
It's a desperate situation

Oh
Hey, hey, hey
There is a joy in a sweet word that's been spoken
And the joy in a dream that's come true
There's a joy that I get when I'm watching you baby, hey
And the joy that I get watching the skies of blue

And then there's a joy,

And the joy of a child that's born to you

Just a little love
Before my life is gone
Just a little love

Every flower needs a little water
Before it can bloom
Every bit of darkness needs some sunshine
To brighten up the gloom
Every lonely heart needs a little love
To keep it beating strong
And all I want is a little loving
Before my life is gone

Just a little love
Before my life is gone

Every rainbow needs a little colour
To brighten up the day
Every baby robin needs some teaching
Before he can fly away
Every lonely heart needs someone to love
To keep its purpose strong
And all I want is someone to love me
Before my life is gone

Just a little love
Before my life is gone

Every lonely man needs a loving woman
To keep his purpose strong
And all I need is someone to love me
Before my life is gone

Just a little love
Before my life is gone
Just a little love
Before my life is gone

You were my wife
My life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means
I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy
All the bitchin', too
Yes I'd forget it all
Once in bed with you
Oh darlin'
How did we end up like this?
Oh baby let me reminisce
(Ooh baby) And when we
Ooh, we stop the hands of time
You set my soul on fire
My one desire was to love you
And think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied
Oh baby, oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I never meant to
Now you see how much you hurt me
But, if you ever need me
I'll be by yor side
Though the many happy times we had
Can really never outweigh the bad
Oh, I never loved nobody
Like I love you, baby
Now it's time for us to say farewell
Farewell my darlin'
Maybe we'll meet down the line
(Ooh baby) It's too late for you and me

Let your conscience be your guide, it won't lie to you
If you live as others do someday you'll be blue
I'll stop beggin' you to stay if you're dissatisfied
You can come or you may stay
Let your conscience be your guide

I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon

Ah, baby, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar

And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good
So when you say you love me, I really believe you, girl
For it's what you say and what you really do

Oh, you've got to understand, darling
The world is not for long, baby
There's only time for singing and praying
And having a love party

You've got to check out the times, baby
'Cause what we need is a love explosion
We don't have no time to waste
Got to pray, whoo

Baby, your life and mine is grooving on the danger
Revelations prophecy's nearly fulfilled
We are blessed to experience a changing world
So let's love before our fate is closed and sealed

You've got to understand, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
The world is not for long
(Got to pray and meditate)

There's only time for singing and praying
(We don't have the time to waste)
And having a love party
(Got to pray and meditate)

Go check out the times, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
What we need is a love explosion
(Got to pray and meditate)

We don't have no time to waste
(We don't have the time to waste)
Got to pray and meditate
(Got to pray and meditate)

On the birdies and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the fishes in the rivers
And on all the things He give us

On your body in His image
And your power with no limits
On your heart and your soul
And your purpose and your goals

On your reasons and your rhymes
And your seasons and your times
On your family and your Bible
And your knowledge of survival

Meditation deep within
That's the way it begins
Baby, it begins
Baby, it begins

Love woke me up this morning feeling fine
I had you on my mind, oh oh
Love woke me up this morning
And I haven't had a heartache today, darling
All my little tears are gone away
Skies are blue because of you, I love you

Love woke me up this morning, oh yes indeed
Thinking of last night
You know, you made me feel all right, oh
Love woke me up this morning
I'm so glad, yes I am

Because of you, happiness is mine
All my cloudy days are all behind
Baby, every place I see your face
And now I smile, you made my life worthwhile
Yes you did
I haven't had a heartache today
And all my little tears are gone away
Because of you, happiness is mine
And all my cloudy days are all behind

I haven't had a heartache today
And all my little tears are gone away

When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belongs to a lonesome cop
I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk,
I go to work.

Love for sale, appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly spoiled
Love for sale
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale.

Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they.
If you want the trill of love,
I've been through the mill of love,
Old love, new love,
Every love but true love.
Love for sale.

I remember yet before we met
Every night and day I had to live the life of a lonely one
Oh and I remember meeting you, discovering life could be true
When shared by two 'stead of one

When you said, you loved me, said oh darling
And we could not be parted, no way
Then I built my world around you, honey yeah
Ever since I found you darlin'

Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, baby
And oh, loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, baby

Each day I pray, we'll never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger baby from day to day
As best I can, I'll always try to reassure and satisfy you
I'd be lost if you went away

Oh when you said, you loved me, honey yeah
And we could not be parted, no, no, no
Right then I built my world around you, yes I did
Ever since I found you honey

Baby you made my life so
So sweeter now baby
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, darlin' yeah, yeah

Honey when you said, you loved me, oh baby
And we could not be parted, oh
I built my world around you, honey
Ever since I found you, darlin'

Loving you, made my life
Sweeter than honey from the bee
You've been good to me
Just loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, oh baby

Baby, loving you
That's all I want to do
You made my life so sweeter
You made my life

Me and my lonely room
Snapping my fingers, pacing the floor
I sulk in my lonely room as I lay my weary head
Down then in comes you're vision you're vision once
Again I cry in my pillow baby

Pacing the floor no were to go as I stroll through the streets
Dragging my weary head down then in comes you're vision you're vision once
Again
Then he goes boo hoo

Every little kiss you give to me I'll store in my memory chest
Even all the tears I shed will be there along with your warm caress

Oh darling, there's no need for me to pretend
That this love will never end, it's possible, you see
So I'll store them away in my memory chest just for me

Every letter that you write to me I'll store in my memory chest
Oh Tammi, so I can look back and read the words and I'll reminisce

I'm not sayin' that you're going to leave me
But there's one thing I do believe, it's possible, you see
Baby, I'm gonna store them away in my memory chest just for me

Every kiss, each caress, all your love and tenderness
In my memory chest, baby

You promised me that our love would last till the end of time
Just in case you see another girl that can change your mind

Every happy moment I spend with you I'll store in my memory chest
Oh baby, you have filled my life, my life with much love and tenderness

Oh darlin', there's no need for me to pretend
That this love will never end, it's possible, you see
So I'll store them away in my memory chest, every little thing

Baby, gonna store in my memory chest
Every letter, baby
Oh, yes I will darlin'
Just for me

Just for me
Oh darling, just for me, baby
Baby, baby, just for me

Ah, mercy, mercy me,
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no.
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east.

Mercy, mercy me,
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no.
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon
Our seas fish full of mercury,

Oh, mercy, mercy me.
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no, no.
Radiation underground and in the sky;
Animals and birds who live near by are dying.

Oh, mercy, mercy me.
Ah, things ain't what they used to be.
What about this over crowded land?
How much more abuse from man can she stand?

So let me tell you 'bout
Last Saturday night
The club was rocking
Super freaks hanging out
Wall to wall
They tell me something's going on in the men's room
Soon as we come out we'll be high soon
Did you save a line for the ladies
We're not into that are you crazy
Who's the super freak in the red dress
When she starts to shake it, I can't take it
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Shake it baby, shake it pretty
We got the party, we got the sounds
We're off in the streets and all the freaks are getting down
Get in the groove baby, and boogie to the beat
Shake, shake your thing
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You make me rock
You make me rock
You turn me on
The way you dance

Midnight lady, sexy dancer
Hot and hardy, love to party
We're jammin' to love
Major love minor love
Jammin' to a great crescendo
Let's party baby, shake it, shake it
Party night to remember
Oh, everybody's having fun
Come on and party turn the green light on

When I saw you
I had to stop
I had to stop in the middle of a bop
I had to stop
I got the rhythm
I got the rhythm
Love is everywhere for the making
Freaks is everywhere for the taking
Blues is in the air if you sing it
Happiness come back if you bring it
I'm having me a good time

Midnight lady, midnight lady
Rockin' and  finger poppin'
Somebody said you was a super freak
I'm here to tell you I'm a super freak baby
Get in the groove

We got to rock, we got the rhythm
We got to come on down to the boogie

Give me that sexy beat

Midnight lady, sexy
You are the one I'm looking for
I never, never, never knew before
Oh, baby, you're looking too good
Super freaky

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?

With more love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy
And my love will be so sound
Gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down
Wear it down, tear it down

And each day I'll be living to 
Make sure I'm giving you more love and more joy

Gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down
Wear it down, tear it down, ooh, ooh
 
Ooh, as we grow older, no need to fear
When you need me I'll be here
I'll be beside you every step of the way
A heart that's truthful, and is keeping it youthful 
With more love, more joy than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound
Gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down
Wear it down, tear it down
 
Gonna give you

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
You make a brotha want to faint (damn!)
Or put you on a plate, sock you up wit a mu'fuckin' biscuit
Maan, it was a house party ayyo I probably sound corny
I got oatmeal hormones ma, I'm instantly horny
I mean, the way you carry yourself
I mean, if I wasn't you I'd probably marry myself
I'm in ya eyes, did I say ya ass? I mean ya eyes
Face bangin' haven't even got to ya thighs
I mean the walk-to-walk is like the Matrix
I could sit a drink on that ass if I had nowhere to place it
Face it, how could anybody dislike you?
These others girl are cool, but not quite like you
I mean, ayyo I focus on my pass a lot
But relationships like Twista, gotta hold ya spot
I mean, and you know that my time is skimpy
If I'm the only in yo heart then it's probably empty
Girl..

[Hook: Zee]
Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee
Ohh things ain't what they used to be, nooo
But ever since you hit the road
Yes I'm spent in this relationship
And I'm so in love and it makes me see

Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee
Ohh things ain't what they used to be, nooo
I can't spend this time alone
I tell ya without you
You'd make me stronger

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
You too fly to be askin' a guy why
All my life love kept on "passin' me by"
You can't change a woman by diamond chainin' her
Change don't make change, mathematically train her
It's a two way thing
Now Scott tell a Motorola by high chairs and baby strollers
I be the sun, you be the moon let the kids be the star
I know who you is, you know who I are
And when the do' close, you know I ain't goin' that far
You got keys to erry house, keys to erry car
And hell yeah, I need love too like LL
I must be on Neptune, 'cause love is for real but still
You not from much and, so girl it ain't no rushin'
And respect how there be more talkin' than touchin'
Seein' you no frontin' is way better than nuttin'
And it means summin to me, if you want me speak on it
Girl..

[Hook: Zee]
Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee

Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee
Ohh things ain't what they used to be, nooo

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
You a housewife
The type of girl that always know what time it is
The tick-tock type, keep her own shoes tied, push her own riide
Quick to give me money when my bills too high
..I need top-notch sex
Wash dishes, and sweep, mop topless
Never give me stress, love when the God bless
Makin' love to the mime boo could be a mental mess
And you don't like me like shy but I'm a lover mon
Other the other hond, can't stand you wit another mon
I went from Timberlond's, tuxedo's, camabons
I got a fast, fast girl I don't want to run
I can't help it I ain't ready
But see havin' a steady girl is a different world like Freddy
Love is deadly, in the shower singin' melodies
I'll make it up if ya let me girl..

[Hook: Zee]
Ohh Murphy, Murphy Leee

Your music makes me want to sing
Girl music, is a joy to bring (just like music)
Music is my heart and soul, more precious than gold
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
Happiness for days, justice all the way
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
I love your music baby (I got my music)
(Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music)

Just like music..

My funny valentine,
Sweet comic valentine 
You make me smile, with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Un-photagraphable
Yet you're my fav'rite work of art
Is your figure, less than Greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me 
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure, less than Greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
Don't baby don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me 
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl

I've even got the month of May
With my girl

I'm coming straight for your love baby
Like a rocket girl
Been so long
I'm making plans to get back to you
Still I'm wondering what to do
Seems so long yeah
I'll make it up to you
Like a rocket girl
I miss you baby

[Chorus:]
Miss your love
And I miss your mind
And your body
We had so much love
I need to love your body
Love your body
Here we are
In and out of love

I hope we're learning to fall in love anew
Girl I know, yeah
I know your tender lovin' that's why I want you
I need you lovin', yeah
Need your love
And I miss your mind and your body
We had so much love
Love to give
I need to love your body
Love your body

Seems so long
Since you were in my arms
I need to rock you
And hold you all night long
I'm so happy to spend this time with you
So very happy that we might start anew

[Chorus]

Love your soul baby
Love your soul baby
My love is waiting for you
I want to love you again
I need you again

My love,
I want to love you again
I need you again
Been so long
Making all my plans to get back to you
What I'm gonna do?
It seems so long, but I'll make it up to you
Like an IBM and a rocket girl

[Chorus]

When I make you mine, I'll be fine
My love is waiting for you

My Mistake (Was To Love You)
Diana Ross
(P. Sawyer/G. Jones)

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

First I had you
In the palm of my hand
But I let you slip through
Like rain to sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

You were sweeter
Then my very own skin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down
Since then darling
It's hard to track you down

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

Many a smile
You put om ny face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

My tenderness
Made you cold, not sweet
'Cause if a girl loves you
You only call her weak

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"



"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"

In the evening when the sun goes down
Oh, you'll find me hangin' 'round
'Cause the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life, oh yes it is

Many people just like you and me
Are dreamin' about how things used to be
But the nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life

Listen to the blues they're playin'
Listen to the blues, to what's saying
Hey, yeah

Home, it's just another place
Oh, from that world of broken dreams
Yes, the nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life, oh yes it is

Sometimes it's sad
Then again it's happy
Oh, mmm, sometimes

My lovin' heart would shake
More than the earth could quake
If you should ever go
You know my heart would break
If I lost your sweet embrace
Even time could not erase
The memories of you
Tears would cover up my face

Oh, how I'd miss you
Baby, I need you so
Oh how I'd miss you
Baby, never go
I'll never leave

My world would cease to be
Without the love you give to me
The chains around my heart
Would never set me free
When my life had just begun
My sky didn't have a sun
You fill my every need
So if you ever leave

Oh, how I'd miss you
Baby, I need you so
Oh, how I'd miss you
Baby, never go
I'll never leave

(Oh, how I'd miss you, baby, baby)
(Oh, how I'd miss you, baby, baby)

Oh you're always on my mind
Losin' you would leave me blind
Fill my heart forevermore
Never leave my love behind
With the joy your love can bring
To you I'll always cling
If you took away your love
It would be the end of things

And oh, how I'd miss you
Oh, baby
Oh, how I'd miss you
Marvin, I need you so
Oh, how I'd miss you

Once upon a time I almost lost my mind
I was lonely, so lonely
Once upon a time

Hoping every day things would go my way
Then you came into my life
Now everything is fine

I never knew what love could do till I met you
Now everything is oh so cozy
Now my skies are blue all because of you
I'm so glad; I was lonely
Once upon a time

Oh, one more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like a camel with a heavy pack
One last straw was added
Said it broke the camel's back
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't take it

One more heartache
It would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high
And then let me down
Like the house you built with toothpicks
Stacked upon the kitchen table
One more toothpick tore it down
The foundation was not able
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't stand it
No, baby
Oh, believe me

One more heartache
Is too much load
I'm fed up with the heartache
One more and I'll explode
Like a toy balloon that's filled
With as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to break
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't stand it
I can't take it
Oh, baby
Don't do it
Oh, honey, ooh, baby

Ooh, once I thought that
Love was a toy for girls and boys
I never gave my heart
I just played the part right from the start

Then there was you, sweet you
With a love that I knew, I knew was true
But in my pride, I left you, baby
Oh, just hangin' on, now love has gone

Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Only a lonely man would know
The hurt inside of me, since I left my pride
Make a fool of me

Ask any lonely man, you see, darlin'
Walk up and ask any lonely man like me, baby

Ooh, foolishly girl, I broke your heart
Now we're apart
Now, in my lonely room, I
Just reminisce, long for your kiss

And through my lonely tears
I can see ahead long lonely years
Without your love
My world, my world's at an end

Blinds closin' in, now, I know
Oh, what I was too slow in learnin'
Oh, now I know
No that I'm all alone, my heart is yearnin'

Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Ask any lonely man, you see, baby
Go on and ask him, baby

Only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Ooh, only a lonely man would know
The hurt inside

Father stop
Criticizing your son
Mother please
Leave your daughters alone
Don't you see that's what wrong
With the world with world today
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

We all talk about kindness
But it's only only a word
Brother turned on a sister
In this cruel cruel world today
That's what's wrong
With all in this world today
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Somebody to play with
Wanna to mold you, wanna mold you
Shape it like they wanna
Wanna to do their thing

Children are told
To give not just to take
If we were all children
You know the world
Will be a better place
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
We should all love each other
Love and take one another
We should love each other
Love and not hate, oh

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
True everybody wants somebody
To mold them, shape them own way
Everybody wants somebody
Try to make it
Or do their, do their thing
Everybody wants to take somebody
Got to make it do their thing
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

Stay baby, please stay
Don't go away baby
Please stay, please stay
(Stay) please stay baby
(Don't go away) don't go away
Don't go away

I'm askin' you darlin' please stay (please stay, baby)
Please, don't go away baby
Please stay baby, please (stay)
Don't go away, no

In bed without you beside me darlin', darlin' anymore
No sugar, no I won't be warm and secure
Oh, baby, baby, baby, like I was before
Oh, baby

I'll just lie tossin' and turnin'
(Tossin' and turnin', tossin' and turnin') baby, baby, baby
All night long, ooh-ooh
Scared that if I closed my eyes (ooh-ooh)
When I got ready to wake up (ooh-ooh)
I might find you gone

Stay, baby please stay
Don't go away baby (don't go away)
Please stay (please stay)
'Cause I could never find nobody (stay, stay, stay)
Make me feel this way (don't go away)
No, sugar (please stay)

For I never felt this way before
No, no sugar you did it
Oh, I never felt so good, honey, before
Oh, top of my head, tip of my toes
Oh I, never felt so good, oh before
No, sugar 'cause you dig it, you got it
Oh, I never felt so good before
Oh, I love you, I just love you

Oh, now, I never felt so good before
Oh, I love ya
Oh, I never felt so good before

(Come this way before)

To keep love and to hold

Keeping you is my goal

And I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days

And your loving ways
No I'll never part from you
And your loving ways

Give me love in return

To let your light come shining through
Aww, baby

Stevie
We really dig you
Hope you don't mind this riff from you

Oh, praise Him when you go to work
Praise Him when your feelings hurt
Praise Him when you're feeling bad
Praise Him when you're feeling sad
All praises to the power
Praise Him by the love you give
Praise Him by the way you live
Praise Him even when you dance and make romance
When you make romance(let your light come shining through,baby)
Praise Him when you got no time
Praise Him whether rain or shine (shine shine shine shine shine)
Praise Him for the sun lighted sky
Praise Him for the moonlight
Praise Him bringing summer
Praise Him for the weather
Praise Him with thy mighty soul
Praise Him with thy money bowl
Praise Him by the words you speak
You'll just have to let you see
Praise Him every single day
Praise Him in all kinds of ways
Praise Him from the mountaintop
Praise Him even
Praise to the power
Praise Him every day
Praise Him in a special way

Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend

Remember anyone can dream
And nothing's bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got
Could be a lot if you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?

Pretty Little Baby
Marvin Gaye
Written by: Clarence Paul/Marvin Gaye/Dave Hamilton

Darling, please stay, don't go away
(If you leave me)
What a heartache, for heaven's sake
(Don't you need me?)
Don't leave me blue of wanting you
(How could I live?)
Don't be untrue, what could I do?

CHORUS:
(Don't you know you)
You gave me the world, little girl
When you gave me your love
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too

Hey look at me, now can't you see
(Tears in my eyes)
Hear what I say, stay here, I pray
(Never leave me)
Why must I plead, you know I need
(All your loving)
Don't put me down, keep me around

(chorus)

And I say, baby, pretty little baby
Don't leave me
Baby, pretty little baby

Darlin', you give me your joy, am I your toy
(Cracked and broken)
I always share your every care
(Wishin', hopin')
All through the years we have no fears
(Now I'm cryin')
You leave the tears fallin' for years

(chorus)

And I say, baby, pretty little baby
Don't leave me
Baby, pretty little baby
...and fade

You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darlin'
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work seven days a week to give you all my money
And that's why you are my pride and joy

And I'm tellin' the world
You're my (pride and joy) pride and joy (pride and joy)
I believe I'm your (baby boy) baby boy (baby boy)
But I know you're my (pride and joy)
My pride and joy (pride and joy)
Yeah baby (baby boy) Yeah baby (baby boy)

You, you are my pride and joy
And a love like mine, yeah baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up (pick me up) when I'm down (when I'm down)
And when we go out, pretty baby
You shake up the whole town (whole town)
And that's why (that's why)
I believe you're my (you're my) pride and joy (pride and joy)

(Pride and joy) [Repeat x4] (baby boy) [Repeat x2]
(Pride and joy) My pride and joy (pride and joy)
And I love you like a baby loves his toy (pride and joy)

Softly they fall, where do they go? 

(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Gentle snowflakes)
Fall from the sky, before your eyes
(It's so thrilling)
Blankets of white, brighten the night
(Such a feeling)
They seem to say, that our love is 

Here to stay
We'll be cozy and warm until summer 

Flowers bloom

Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(Chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(Tootsies toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the 
Gloom
I will always remember this night, 

Here with you
There snowflakes, pretty purple 

Snowflakes
Snowflakes, pretty purple 

Snowflakes
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(Chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(Tempters toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the 
Gloom
I will always remember this night, 

Here with you
And I say snowflakes, pretty purple 

Snowflakes
I'll always Remember the snowflakes
And you baby, and you 
Snowflakes are falling, falling, 

Fallin
And I got you in my arms

Hey baby, that's alright people
I know that's alright
Everyday, that's alright
Oh, when we love each other

I know that's alright
Oh just feel it, feel it
Oh everybody feel it
God know that's alright, yes

Some of us were born with money to spend
Some of us were born for races to win
Some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowin' in the air

For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
And heed the people's cries
Let me say to you

Turn on, on, feel it, feel
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey, right on

For those of us who live where peace is craved
For those of us who live, where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life, yeah
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth, talk about it

For those of us who live a life, hey, hey, hey enjoyin' ourselves
For those of us who got drowned in the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else

Love, love, sweet love, love, wonderful love
Ah, true love, love, love for your brother
And love, love for God
Love, pure love

Ah true love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
And my darlin', one more thing
If you let me, I will take you to live where love is king
Oh, baby

Rockin' after midnight
We'll be rockin' after midnight (repeat)
After midnight, girl
After midnight, baby
It's time to rock, ooh
Let me rock you, rock you
Rock you into midnight, baby
Let me rock you into love
I know you give me lots and lots of good lovin' baby
After midnight, baby
The time, the time is right for you and me tonight
But now we've got to dance
And soon after we make romance
You know I need your love
Worser than the stars above
Darling don't hesitate
After the date, oh, no, no, no-o-o
Sweetheart, your so good to me
Your precious lovin' can't be beat
Oh my sweet
I love the way you do your thing
Hey
I love all the joy you bring
I love the way you coochie-coo
And
I love making love to you
Call out in the name of love
Call out in the name of tenderness
Call out in the name of sweet love
Call out in the name of happiness
I love the way you walk baby
And I really love the way you talk girl
And I really love the way you move
Thrill me, thrill me, thrill me
Groove me, groove me, groove me
I love those little pretty ways
Want to be in love with you
For the rest of my days
And I even love the funky little things you do
I'm in trouble baby
I love your mind and your body too
My heart is yours to keep baby
And your happiness is all I see
And your love will be my last
Oh, I say good-bye to the heartbreak past
Oh, yes, I'm understood
Oh, baby do me good
I love the way you do your thing, hey
I love all the joy you bring
I love all your pretty ways
I love you the rest of your days
I love the way you coochie-coo, and
I love making love to you
I love you baby
I love you baby
I love you baby
I love you baby
So tonight when the right time comes
I'll be getting some, get it, get it
So tonight when the right time comes
I'll be getting some
Having fun

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And its bound to forsake me

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I cant find it

In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
Ain't seen nothing but trouble baby paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self-destructions in my hands

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can find it

I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy
Who makes slaves out of men

Ahhh yeah

I did the best I could
Nobody understood

I did the best I could
Nobody understood (take way, take me away)
I did the best I could
Nobody understood

It was a sad wedding
A very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes

We fell in love
First day we met
Then later on we were wed
And as we stood there
Greeting all our friends
Here's what I heard somebody say

It was a sad wedding
Oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding
A very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes

I was so nervous, I just couldn't wait
To see you walk down the aisle
Then suddenly there was music, and all my fear was gone
And you came walking with a smile

We had our reception
Then we were on our way
Off to our honeymoon
When you threw your bouquet
And rice flew over our heads
I overheard somebody say

It was a sad wedding
Oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding

And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears, tears, tears

People are wondering about
The change that's come over me
Because a smile upon my face
Is something rare for them to see
But how can I tell someone else
What I don't understand myself?
It's like walking into the sunshine
Out of the glow, and oh baby

It's just a satisfied feeling,
Oh yeah, down in my soul
Imagine something so strong
That keeps the world from doing you wrong
It gives you power, it gives you drums
And there ain't nothing you can't overcome
Like a puzzle when the pieces fit
I know that this is it
It's like watching a brand new day
Begin to glow, and oh baby

Just a satisfied feeling
Down in my soul
And I don't know what
It is about you
But I can't stand the thought
Of ever ever being without you
So I'm going to love you
And never let you out of my sight
'Cause the way you make me feel
Has got to be right

Oh baby, you know it's like a flame
Burning within
And I know people can see it from afar
And it gives you a special something
That makes you wonder who you are
If we had words, we could tell it all
The joys big and small
But I'm afraid the love we got
Can never be told
Oh baby, it's just a satisfied feeling
Down in my soul

I just want to ask a question
Who really cares?
To save a world in despair
There'll come a time, when the world won't be singin'
Flowers won't grow, bells won't be ringin'
Who really cares?
Who's willing to try to save a world
That's destined to die
When I look at the world it fills me with sorrow
Little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow
Oh what a shame, such a bad way to live
All who is to blame, we can't stop livin'
Live, live for life
But let live everybody
Live life for the children
Oh, for the children
You see, let's save the children
Let's save all the children
Save the babies, save the babies
If you wanna love, you got to save the babies
All of the children
But who really cares
Who's willing to try
Yes, to save a world
Yea, save our sweet world
Save a world that is destined to die
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, oh dig it everybody

Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.

Ooh, now let's get down tonight
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the things you're dealing
I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
Get up, get up, get up, get up, let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, 'cos you do it right
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's good to me
My baby ohhh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feeling, I need sexual healing

This is the story of two lovers who shouldn't have been
They did their thing and went their separate ways again
Then by chance they met at the neighborhood dance
And got that old feeling all over again. That said,
How much I've missed (it) since I had you 

How much. How much.
Ooh I really wondered?girl
Wondered if you remember baby
How could say (wait) to me darling
Such a thrill?.
But it's been so hard since I had you baby

Ah sugar, come on give me a break
Cause it's been so hard since I had you baby

My - eyes must look serious
Cause when I look at you I get delirious
Your,voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again - baby

Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had your sugar
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had you baby

Big Daddy Rucker is sho' nuff playin'
Ahhh?this is a mello dance
Ouh?baby its been such a long time
Remember when I used to do this to you
Come on, let this be the last dance

Since I had you girl I have wanted no other lover
Since I had you honey there hasn't been no other woman
Since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
Since I taste you loving I haven't seen no other woman
Since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
You might believe it but since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me 
That's some kind of wonderful
Any time my little world is blue 
I just have to look at you
And every thing seems to be some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful

Dreamed of you this morning, 
Then came the dawn and ,

I used to hear a sparrow singing, baby
Oh, but one day as I went along I didn't hear his song
But I know the sparrow should sing
Sing on such a morning in spring
Oh sparrow, why don't you sing?

Sing to me, oh, sparrow come around
Come around, why don't you come around?
Sing about melody, aww, melody
About the things you see
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out now, sing it on out

Let the world know what life's all about
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Oh sing, little sparrow, won't you sing for me?

And for the rest of all my world
They'll appreciate it, I know
Every time I'm feeling low
I know I can always count on you
Sing, little sparrow
About the troubles you're in, places you've been
You can sing I know it, don't you try to pretend

Sing while you're here, sing a song, my dear
Let me hear your song, do you mean to call
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
I want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
A pretty bird song

Sing to me, let me hear your agony
Did you see me sucking up the lay?
Sing to me of peace and love
Sing to me of God and love
Sing sparrow, oh sparrow, sing

Sing to me about man's inhumanity
And all the injustice you see
Sing sparrow, sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing about what to give
Sing about about how to live
I want you to sing your tune sparrow
Oh, little sparrow, sing

Sing to me of jealousy
Aww, sing what that's all about
Sing it all out, shout, little sparrow
Aww, sing at me
Sing me a, sing me a song
I wanna know what's wrong, little bird, tell me
Aww, sparrow

Sing sparrow 'cause I wanna know
You sweet, itty, bitty, pretty bird
Sing before you go
Sing to me, Marvin Gaye before you fly away
Never stop singing sparrow till we hear your song

Sing your song
Sing your song
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and
I remember a bird

Woah-oh-oh, oooh

You're alone, all the time
Does it ever bother you? Have you asked why?
You seem, to fall in love, and out again
Do you really ever love? Or just pretend?
Oh baby, why fool yourself?
Don't be afraid, to help yourself
It's never too late, to late to

Stop, look, yes, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Love, oh, love, love

Though you try, you can't hide
All the things you really feel, this time decide
That you, will open up, let it in
There's no shame in sharing love, you feel within
So jump right in
Head over heels, and fall right in
It's never too late, to late to

Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Stop, look, oh, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Love, love, love

A buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
But the monkey grabbed his neck and said, now, listen, Jack

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

Ain't no use in divin', what's the use of jivin'
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

The buzzard told the monkey, you're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Fly right

Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.

Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

I try to put my arms around you
All because I want to hold you tight
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight
Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

I'm gonna love you
In every way
I'm gonna love you
In every way

With other girls I've wanted
I've made it just a moment
With you I'll share each day
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain
Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

Everybody sings
Yeah yeah yeah,  yeah yeah yeah
Everybody sings
Yeah yeah yeah,  yeah yeah yeah
Sing now everybody
Yeah yeah yeah,  yeah yeah yeah

Oh beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self, our country loved
And mercy more than life

America, America may God thy gold refine
Til all success be nobleness
And every gain divined

And you know when I was in school
We used to sing it something like this, listen here

Oh beautiful, for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain

But now wait a minute, I'm talking about
America, sweet America
You know, God done shed his grace on thee
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in brotherhood
From sea to shining sea

You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this
(America, America, God shed his grace on thee)
America, I love you America, you see
My God he done shed his grace on thee
And you oughta love him for it
Cause he, he, he ,he crowned thy good
He told me he would, with brotherhood
(From sea to shining Sea)
Oh lord, oh lord, I thank you Lord
(Shining sea)

Angel eyes angel eyes
The ways of the world are feeble
Don't give up on simple people
Angle eyes stun those nights
The blues you can live without
It's not what you song's about
Angel eyes angel eyes
Tell me what would we're doin'
Without the light from angel eyes

You can move the hearts of men
Just with a phrase you're turning
Since hearts ever have been yearning
Bear with us bear so alone
Thin lines you've been living on
Are so close to the danger zone
Angel eyes angel eyes
Tell me what would we're doin'
Without the light from angel eyes

Angelina, why did you have to go
It's hard enough alone, well you should know
The scars you never showed me
Your eyes that turned away

Angelina, to God for you I prayed
Angelina, I often heard you weep
At times I'd stay awake and watch you sleep
Your innocence would move me

At times you've made me scared
Angelina, my love for you I cared
Angelina, in silence you would speak
A simple touch of you and I grew weak

You finally let me hold you
The day before you died
Angelina, my angel in the sky
You finally let me hold you
The day before you died
Angelina, my angel in the sky

Well, I just stopped in this evening
To get myself a little taste
The music is nice and swinging
And of course, I really dig the place

Course, I haven't
Had much sleep lately
I feel sorta down and out

Yeah, but look over there
In the corner, man
Oh, yeah, there's something
To shout about

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
Cause as soon as I pay the bartender
Girl, I'll be right there

She looked up and blushed and smiled
And my heart skipped a beat
Mmm, she's stacked from
Her head down to her feet

Hey, barkeep
You better come here and get your bread
This little girl's getting ready to split
And I'm about to go out of my head

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
I'm afraid if I lose sight of you
I just might not see you no more

She slowed up just a little bit
And turned her head and smiled
She was 34-24-38
And dressed in the latest style

I finally caught up
With the pretty little thing
Before she got out on the street

And she told she was
Waiting on her old man
Who was a policeman on the beat

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
If you're a policeman's woman
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.
Just talking to you is a crime

(That's right, bud, let's go)
Oh, no

I say, baby, don't you cry
You know I'll soon discover
One day by and by
That you loved another

No matter what you say
I'm gonna leave you right away
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry

Mmm, you know you can't deny
I did my best to please you
But you were so unkind
But still I try to need you

True love that was sincere
You didn't really care
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry

And I remember, sweetheart
That it was you and I
Who said that we must part, uh huh

And the time has
Come to say goodbye
So why do you cry, sweetheart

Hey, hey, baby, don't you cry
Because I'm interfering
You ought to be satisfied
You know I'm gonna keep on caring

Why should you feel blue
I'll tell you, I'm gonna
Be the one to lose
Baby, baby, don't you cry

Whoa, baby, don't you cry
Because of any hearing
You ought to be satisfied because
I'm gonna keep on caring

Why should you feel blue
You know I'll be the one to lose
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry

Late at night
When it's dark and cold
I reach out
For someone to hold
When I'm blue
When I'm lonely
She comes through
She's the only one who can
My baby grand
Is all I need

In my time
I've wandered everywhere
Around this world
She would always be there
Any day
Any hour
All it takes
Is the power in my hands
This baby grand's
Been good to me

I've had friends
But they have slipped away
I've had fame
But it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes
Spent them fast enough
As for woman
They don't last with just one man
But baby grand
Will stand by me

They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these
Played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far
From the life I've strayed in
I've got scars
From those dives I've played in
Now I'm home
And I'm weary
In my bones
Every dreary one night stand
But baby grand
Came home with me

Ever since this gig began
My baby grand's
Been good to me

(I really can't stay)
Betty, it's cold outside
(I've got to go away)
Betty, it's cold out there

(This evening has been)
Been hoping that you'd drop in
(So very nice)
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

(My mother will start to worry)
Beautiful, what's you're hurry
(And father will be pacing the floor)
Listen to that fireplace roar

(So really I'd better scurry)
Beautiful, please don't hurry
(Well, maybe just a half a drink more)
Why don't you put some records on while I pour

(And the neighbors might think)
Betty it's bad out there
(Say, what's in this drink?)
No cab's to be had out there

(I wish I knew how)
Your eyes are like starlight now
(To break the spell)
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

(I ought to say no, no, no, sir)
Mind if I move in closer?
(At least I'm gonna say that I tried)
What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?

(I really can't stay)
Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside

(I simply must go)
Betty, it's cold outside
(The answer is no)
I say, it's cold out there

(The welcome has been)
How lucky that you dropped in
(So nice and warm)
Look out that window, man that's hard

(My sister will be suspicious )
Gosh, your lips look delicious
(My brother will be there at the door)
Waves upon a tropical shore

(My maiden aunt's mind is vicious)
Gosh, your lips are delicious
(Well maybe just a cigarette more)
Oh, never such a blizzard before

(I've got to go home)
Betty, you'll freeze out there
(Say, lend me your coat)
It's up to your knees out there

(You've really been grand)
I thrill when you touch my hand
(But don't you see)
How can you do this thing to me

(There's bound to be talk tomorrow)
Think of my lifelong sorrow
(At least there will be plenty implied)
If you caught pneumonia and died

(I really can't stay)
Get over that old lie
Ah, but it's cold outside

Baby let me hold your hand
Until I make you understand
Ohh, baby, baby let me hold your hand
I really believe, everything will sure be grand
Baby I want you by my side
Our love we could never hide
Ohh, baby, baby I want you by my side
Well you know pretty baby, our love we would never hide

Baby I'll buy you a diamond ring
Cadillac and everything
Then baby, I'm gonna buy you a house in style
Then I'll live there forever, yes lord with my little wife and child

I got the blues
I feel so lonely
I'd give the world if I could only make you understand
Yes, it surely would be grand
I'm simply wild about my baby
Ask her won't she please come home
Since she's gone I stay worried all the time
So, baby, won't you please come home?
You know your daddy's all alone
I have tried but all in vain
Never no more to call your name
Since you left, you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you please come home to your daddy?
Baby, won't you please come home?
Since you left you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you please come home to your daddy?
Baby, won't you please come home?

Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sirree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Basin Street, oh Basin Street
Is the street, mama 
New Orleans, land of dreams

Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally
If you will be my love
 
Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally

After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank god, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis. your chance, finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!

Ah, let me tell you people
About this blackjack game
It's caused me nothing but trouble
And I've only myself to blame

Hey-hey, hey, yeah
How unlucky can one man be?
Well, every quarter I get, now
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me

My friends don't come around me
Because I've been so blind
I can't even borrow a nickel
Now I've almost lost my mind

Hey-hey hey, yeah
How unlucky can one man be?
Well, every quarter I get
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me

I sat there with two tens
I thought I'd have some fun
The dealer hit sixteen with a five
Just enough to make twenty-one

Hey-hey hey, yeah, yeah
How unlucky can one man be?
Well, every quarter I get
Yeah, blackjack takes it away from me

Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away.

Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it,
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.

But Ill blame it on the sun,
The sun that didn't shine,
Ill blame it on the wind and the trees.

Ill blame it on the time that never was enough,
Ill blame it on the tide and the sea,
But, my heart blames it on me.

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?

Wish I could tell you,
But, words won't come for me to speak.

But Ill blame it on the sun,
That didn't fill the sky,
Ill blame it on the birds and the trees.

Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon,
Ill blame it on the nights that could not be,
But, my heart blames it on me.

(background)...yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh,
Your heart blames it on you this time.

Poor little, sad little blue Bluesette
Don't you cry, don't you fret
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken
And your blues will be forsaken
Some lucky day lovely love will come your way

If there is love in your heart to share
Dear Bluesette, don't despair
Some blue boy is waiting just like you
To find a someone to be true to
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay

Get set, Bluesette
True love is coming
Your lonely heart soon will be humming

Pretty little Blusette
Musn't be a mourner
Have you heard the news yet?
Love's 'round the corner
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons
To make your next springtime
Your gold wedding ring time

Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that you're not there
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

Born to lose and now I'm losing you

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry

Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I think I'm gonna die

There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy and I'm so blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry

I'm through with romance
I'm through with love
I'm through with countin' the stars above
And that's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me

Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I think I'm gonna die

I think I'm gonna die
I think I'm gonna die
I think I'm gonna die

I think I'm gonna die
I think I'm gonna die
I think I'm gonna die

You C C Rider, see what you done done
C C Rider, you see what you done done
You C C Rider, you see what you done done
You done made me love you and now your man done come

My home is on the water, I don't like no land at all
Home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
My home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
I'd rather be dead than to stay here and be your dog

So you C C Rider, see what you done done
C C Rider, you see what you done done
You C C Rider, you see what you done done
You done made me love you and now your man done come

California here I come,
Right back where I started from,
Where bowers and flowers bloom in the sun,
Each morning at dawning birdies sing and everything.

A sun kissed miss said "Don't be late." 
That's why I can hardly wait,
So open up those Golden gate California here I COME!

The tropic moves sides of ships at sea
But doesn't matter if my thoughts are free
Cant you see what you're doing to me
The honeybee makes a sigh at me 
The birds above sing a song of love 
Though I have cried constantly
That's not the thing to do
This feeling has me dangling on a string
With no escape seemingly
Though I have thoughts with myself that I'm lost
So let it be
Let my favorite cloud
Pass over me
Forget about
The past with glee
So if you smile real soon
I'll hear angels singing
A tune
Can't you see darlin' what you're doing to me?

Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

"Candy"
I call my sugar "Candy"
Because I'm sweet on "Candy"
And "Candy" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding "Candy"
And "Candy"'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
"Candy"
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my "Candy"
And make him mine all mine
Mine

Well, I say love, oh, love
Careless love
I said love, oh, love
Oh, careless love
Love, please tell me
What have I done
For you to hurt me all in fun

Well, you know
That I once was blind
But know I see
I say that I once was blind
But now I see
Whoa, you know I once was blind
But I'm so glad, so glad I see
That that old love has made
A fool of me

Well, you know what
A big fool I have been
Let me say what
A big fool I have been
Let me say what
What a big fool that I have been
But I'll be, I'll be one
All over again

Well, you know if I can mmm
Like a morning dove
Well, if I could mmm
Like a morning dove
Well, if I could moan
If I could moan
Like a morning dove
You know I'd moan
For everyone in love

That's why I said love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, love
Careless love

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,
There's where the darkey's heart am longed to go.

There's where I labored so hard for old massa,
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely,
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darkies' life am passed away.

Massa and misses, have long gone before me,
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore.
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tators grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,
There's where the old darkies' heart am longed to go.

Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam

Down through the ages, 'round this time of year
People's hearts all aglow
Yuletide carols fill the air with cheer
While children laugh and play out in the snow

Lights on Christmas trees and snowflakes fallin' down
What a lovely sight it is to see
You will always know when Christmas time is near
You feel the need to be in harmony

'Cause Christmas time is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love
Christmas time is all about receiving
The gift that God has sent from up above

People goin' here and people goin' there
Buying gifts for those they know and love
Never stop to think that the greatest gift of all
Is he who sends his love from up above

Waitin' in suspense to open all my gifts
It seems like the time just creeps along
When we finally see the presents that we have
We open up our hearts and sing this song

That Christmas time is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love
Christmas time is all about receiving
The gift that God has sent from up above

Christmas time is really more than givin'
Christmas time is all about receiving
Christmas time, spreading news of peace and love
Christmas time, the gift that God has sent from up above
Christmas time is really more than givin'
Christmas time is all about receiving

Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You gonna love me, like no one love me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
Wouldn't it be fine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we are out of the money, yeah
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

You gonna love me, like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine

You're gonna look for me, child, you know
And I'll be gone

So come back, baby, yeah, yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh, now, now

I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heaven's open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
Yeah when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Yes I need her in the daytime (I need her)
Yes I need her in the night (I need her)
Yes I want to throw my arms around her (I need her)
Kiss and hug her, kiss and hug her tight

Yeah when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

If your sweetheart, sends a letter, of goodbye
It's no secret, you'll feel better, if you cry
When wakened, from a bad dream, don't you sometimes think it's real
Well it's only, false emotion, that you feel

If your heartaches, seems to hang around, too long
And your blues, keep getting blue-er, with each song
Remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry

(If your heartaches seem to hang around too long)
(And your blues keep getting blue-er with each song)
Well remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
Why don't you let your hair down now, baby go on and cry

I said let your hair down, baby go on and cry.

Now you say you're lonely
You cried the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me,
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember?
I remember all that you said
Told me love was to plebeian
Told me you were through with me
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember?
I remember all that you said
Told me love was to plebeian
Told me you were through with me 
And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do 
Come on! Come on!
Cry me a river  
Cry me a river 
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin' Oooh
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder (fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger (stronger)
If I lived to be a hundred years old

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Yeah now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now you say you've found someone that you love better (better)
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow ('morrow)
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Alright now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
(That it won't be long before it's cryin' time)

Sad and lonely all the time
That's because I've got a worried mind
You know the world is in an uproar
The danger zone is everywhere, everywhere

Just read your paper
And you'll see
Just exactly what keeps worryin' me
Yeah, you'll see the world is in an uproar
The danger zone is everywhere

My love for the world is like always
For the world is a part of me
That's why I'm so afraid
Of the progress that's being made
Toward eternity

Every morning, noon, and night
Finds me hoping that everything's alright
Mm-hmm, the world is in an uproar
The danger zone is everywhere

The days of wine and roses,
Laugh and run away,
Like a child at play,
Through a meadowland,
Toward a closing door,
A door marked never more,
That wasn't there before.

The lonely night discloses,
Just a passing breeze,
Filled with memories,
Of the golden smile,
That introduced me to,
The days of wine and roses,
And you!

The lonely night discloses,
Just a passing breeze,
Filled with memories,
Of the golden smile,
That introduced me to,
The days of wine and roses,
And you!

I was oh, so blue till you came along
Just to make my life a wonderful song
You brought sunshine just to brighten my loneliness
Is it any wonder in my happiness
I confess

Do I want you
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do
Do I need you?
Oh my, do I
Honey, 'deed I do

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hangin' 'round you
Do I love you?
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do

There are lots of others that I have met
Those you meet today, tomorrow forget
You're the only one who ever could stand the test
That's the reason why I choose you from the rest
You're the best

Do I want you
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do
Do I need you?
Oh my, do I
Honey, 'deed I do

Do I ever cross your mind
Darlin' do you ever see
Some situation somewhere, somehow
Triggers your memory
And do you ever wonder
What became of all the time
And darlin' do I ever, ever cross your mind

Do you ever want to know
If all dreams go on endlessly
Or do they just run down
Somehow and gradually become
The custody of that melancholy jailer father time
And darlin' do I ever, ever cross your mind
Do I ever cross your mind
uninvited - when you're lonely
Or does that only, only happen to me
And don't you ever wonder
What became of all the time
And darlin' do I ever, ever cross your mind

Do I ever cross your mind
Uninvited when you're lonely
Or does that only, only happen to me
And don't you ever wonder
What became of all the time
And darlin' do I ever, ever cross your mind
And darlin' do I ever, ever cross your mind

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go, I don't know,
She wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Why she had to go, I don't know,
She wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Usin' the phone booth,
Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, "Don't be dizzy,
"Can't you see I'm very busy,
"Doodlin' away, doodlin' away."

"Do you doodle all day?"
Asked the waiter in his way,
"Do you doodle all night?"
Told the waiter he was right,
"In your doodlin' way-"
"That's the way I'm gonna stay,"
"Are you thinkin' things right?"
"Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,"
"Don't know what I can do,"
"Ain't nothing you can do,"
"With old doodlin' you,"
"Doodin's all I want to do,"

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away

We just doodle all day!

It brings a tear
Into my eyes
When I begin
To realize
I've cried so much
Since you've been gone
I guess I'll drown in my own tears

I sit and cry
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown, oh yes, in my own tears

I know it's true
Into each life
Oh, some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more

Why don't you
Come on home
Oh yes, so I won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon

I guess I'll (drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me (drown in my own tears)

Oh, yeah, baby don't let me (drown in my own tears)

Oh, hmmm

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care ?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely peopl
Where do they all belong

Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,
Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.

When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,

Everytime we say goodbye.
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,

Everytime we say goodbye.

Evening, every night you come and you find me
And you always remind me that my baby's gone
Evening, you got me deeply in your power
Every minute seems just like an hour, now that my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Oh evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my man is gone

Through these misty eyes I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country
heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
but don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the
Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

Never knew how much I love you, never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night.

Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, oh fever all through the night.

Everybody's got the fever, that is something that you should know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago.
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh
Tell 'em about it
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said "Julie baby you're my flame"
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth.

Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
But when her Daddy tried to kill him, she said "Daddy,Daddy don't you dare"
He gives me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right.

Now you've heard our story, (oh, it's your story)
Here's the point we have made (I'm listening)
Chicks were born to give you fever (that's right)
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn

Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.
Aha, what a lovely way to burn.
I tell you, what a lovely way to burn.
All right now, what a lovely way to burn.
I like that, what a lovely way to burn.

For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know

If you're ever in a jam, here I am.
If you're ever in a mess, S.O.S.
If you're so happy, you land in jail. I'm your bail
When other friendships are soon forgot, ours will still be hot
Da da da da da da dig dig dig
If you're ever up a tree, just phone to me
If you ever loose your teeth when you're out to dine, borrow mine
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are soon forgeet, ours will still be great
Loddle doddle chuck chuck chaa
If they ever cook your goose, turn me loose.
And if they ever put a bullet through your brain, I'll complain.
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship.
When other friendships are soon forgit, ours will still be it.
Ah loddle doddle hip hap hap.
If you ever loose your mind, I'll be kind.
And if you ever loose your shirt, I'll be hurt.
If you're ever in a mill and get sawed in half, I won't laugh.
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship.
When other friendships are are up the crick, ours will still be slick.
Ah loddle doddle woof woof woof, hep hep hep, chopp chop chop, dig dig dig.
Good evening friends.

You went away, didn't say goodbye
But I still love you, Lord, I wonder why
Oh baby, my baby

Nothing in this world too good for a girl, so good and true
Whoa, baby, ain't I good to you?

I bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring, yes I did
And a big Cadillac car, and everything

That's why I'm so good to you

I bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring
And a great big Eldorado and everything

It must be love that makes me treat you
The way that I do, gee
Baby, ain't I good to you?

Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

I said Georgia
Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

I said Georgia
Ooh Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Whoa, Georgia
Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just this old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

I said just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby

I've tried both night and day
But I'm beggin' you just one more time
Come back if you don't stay

Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby, yeah

You better come on, now
Get on the right track, baby, yeah
Come on home and treat me wrong again, oh yeah

And give my poor heart ease

Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby
Get on the right track, baby, yeah
Come on home and treat me wrong one more again
That's what I say now

Sunday is gloomy; my hours are slumber-less
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Gloomy Sunday

Well Ive had my fun if I dont get well no more
Well Ive had my fun if I dont get well no more
Yeah my head is spinning
And Im going down slow
Please write my mother tell her the shape Im in
Please write my mother tell her the shape Im in
Tell her to pray for me
Forgive me for my sins
(harmonica solo)

Dont send me no doctor he wont do me no good
Dont send me no doctor he wont do me no good
I said its all my fault
Did do things I shouldnt have... (chris)

Driftin and stumblin like a ship out on the sea
Driftin and stumblin like a ship out on the sea
I aint got nobody
To care for me

As I was walking down the street last night
A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, "Hold it bud, I don't play that game"
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, "My name's Flo, and you're on the right track
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back
So if you want to have fun in this man's land
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands"

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose
She said, "Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose"
I sat back down with a smiling face
While she went down to the powder place

With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

The music stopped and the lights came on
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long
I left the place with tears in my eyes
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

The torch I carry is handsome, it's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals, I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather, I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together, guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy, I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself: "Where is she?"
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops, moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories, remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her, but I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by - oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Well, if you loved me half as much as I love you
You couldn't worry me half as much as you do
Woah, you're so nice to me when there's no one else around
But you only build me up to take me down

Oh, but if you missed me half as much as I miss you
Well, you couldn't stay away half as much as you do
Woah, I know that I could never be this blue
Well, if you only loved me half as much as I love you

I know that I, I know that I could never be this blue
Woah, if you only loved me half as much as I love you

Well, as I love you
Oh, as I love you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say, "She told me so"
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her - on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her - on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know, I just love her so?
She's my little woman, waitin' all this time
Babe, I'm a little fool for you, little girl

Oh, hang your head in shame
Oh, don't your conscience ever bother you
Every time you hear my name
Well, try and think of all that I've gone through
And then you hang your head in shame

Someone came along and took my place
Then you gave me all the blame
Well, you should go somewhere and hide your face
And then hang your head in shame

When you said I was the only one
Was it just your little game?
Now look back on all the harm you've done
And then you can hang your head in shame

I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I kept the flame
Oh, you'll be sorry, darling, yes you will, will
And you gonna hang your head in shame
And hang your head in shame

In old Savannah
I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of a Southern brand
But here's what I don't understand

They got a gal there 
A pretty gal there
Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone.

They call her
Hard-hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them
To torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's hard-hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her hard-hearted Hannah,
The Vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas;
Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas

To tease them and thrill them
To torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say
An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your BVD's

She's hard-hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, GA
Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah
Anytime a woman can take a great big pan
Start pouring water on a drowning man
She's hard-hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, GA

Ooh, she's sweet as sour milk!

My mother told me
Fore she passed away
Said son when I'm gone
Don't forget to pray

Cause there'll be hard times
Lord those hard times
Who knows better than I?

Well I soon found out
Just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes
Just to pay the rent

Talkin' 'bout hard times
Lord those hard times
Who knows better than I?

I had a woman
Who was always around
But when I lost my money
She put me down

Talkin' 'bout hard times
Hard times
Yeah, yeah, who knows better than I?

Lord, one of these days
There'll be no more sorrow
When I pass away

And no more hard times
No more hard times
Yeah, yeah, who knows better than I?

In Ol' Savannah,
I said, Savannah,
The weather there is nice and warm,
The women are the Southern brand,
But there's one thing I don't understand
They gotta gal there
A pretty gal there,
Who's colder,
Than an Arctic Storm!
She's gotta heart as cold as stone,
And even nice men,
They leave her alone

They call her Hardhearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough,
But Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who likes to see men suffer

To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say.
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man
That's Hardhearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah G-A

They call her Hardhearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Talk about your cold refrigerating mamma's
Brother she's a polar bears pajamas

To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say.
An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like being in Alaska in your B.V.D.'s
That's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah G-A

You told me, we would never part

You know you broke my heart

Heaven help the child who never had a home,
Heaven help the girl who walks the streets alone
Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall,
Heaven help us all.
Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day,
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away.
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl,
Heaven help us all.
Heaven help us all
Heaven help us all, help us all.
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call Oh, yeah!
Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty one,
Heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun.
Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall,
Lord, Heaven help us all.
Heaven help us all.
Heaven help us all,
Heaven help us all, help us all.
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call, help us all.
 
Now I lay me down before I go to sleep.
In a troubled world, I pray the Lord to keep, keep hatred from the mighty,
And the mighty, from the small,
Heaven help us all.
Oh, oh, oh, yeah! 
Heaven help us all
Heaven help us all.
Heaven help us all,
Heaven help us all, help us all.
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call, help us all.

Here we go again
She's back in town again
I'll take her back again
One more time

Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again
One more time

I've been there before
And I'll try it again
But any fool knows
That there's no way to win

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

I'll take her back again
One more time

Hey, Girl! I want you to know,
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go.
And, Hey, Girl! I tell you  no lie,
Something deep inside of me's going to die,
if you say so long, if this is goodbye. Oh!

Hey, Girl! This can't be true,
How am I supposed to exist without you?
And, Hey, Girl! Now don't put me on,
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone.
How will I live. How can I go on.
How can I go on? Hey, Girl!

Hey, Girl! Now sit yourself down,
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground,
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!

Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?

Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe

And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me

Hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?

I'm free and ready, so we can go steady
How's about savin' all your time for me?
No more lookin', I know I've been tooken
How's about keepin' steady company?

I'm gonna throw my date-book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page

Hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?

Well, did you ever wake up in the morning?
Just about the break of day
Reach over and rub the pillow
Where your baby used to lay

[Chorus]
Hey Now!
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, Hey now
Well, you know they make you feel so bad
That you lay right down and die

Then you put on your crying
Like you've never cried before
You even cry so loud
You give the blues to your neighbor next door

And you say, Hey Now!
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, Hey now
Well, you know they make you feel so bad
That you lay right down and die

Well, I got the blues so bad now
I'm tellin' ya it just hurt my feet to walk now
I got the blues so bad now people
It justa hurt my tongue to talk now

[Chorus]

Then you cry Lord, Lord
Won't you hear my plea?
I know you can have mercy on everybody
So won't you please send a little bit down to me?

Hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me
Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe

I got a brand new car and a two dollar bill
Yeah, I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
So, if you wanna have fun, come along with me

So hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'

So, if you wanna have fun, come along with me

So hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me

Oh, I was lying in the bed with fever
And I was, burning up inside
My baby walked, in my bedroom
And I could hardly open my eyes
She said that she was going to the pawnshop
Just across the track
She started packing some clothes in a hurry
And then she said she would be right back
But I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away
I remember so well when she slammed the door
But the girl didn't make it back no more
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day
Well, I waited for 24 hours, and I was just about to starve to death
It didn't look like she was comin' back, so I had to look out for myself
Well I called, the police department, to find out what they knew
They said, "No, by heck, but we will get her yet", because they was lookin' for her too
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away
Well I don't know what happened a-cross the track
But I know my baby didn't make it back
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day

Well I called, my Dr. Foster, and when the girl answered the phone
I got a funny feeling, the way she said Dr. Foster had gone
She said, "He left with a lady patient, about 24 hours ago"
I added two and two, and here's what I got: I got I'll never see that girl no more
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah
But I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away
If Dr. Foster has got her, then I know I'm through
Because he's got medicine and, money too
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day
Whoa, no

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more
What'd you say?

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more

Oh woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever have seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more
What'd you say?

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more

Now baby, listen baby, don't you treat me this way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
Don't care if you do, 'cause it's understood
You ain't got no money, you just ain't no good
Well, I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more
What'd you say?

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more

Well (don't you come back no more)
Uh, what you say? (don't you come back no more)
I didn't understand you (don't you come back no more)
You can't mean that (don't you come back no more)
Oh now baby please (don't you come back no more)
What you tryin' to do to me? (don't you come back no more)
Oh, don't treat me like that, baby (don't you come back no more)

When I got misery, oh my where are you, honey
Honey, oh honey honey, where can you be
Whisperin' when the lights are low, to each
Teardrop on my pillow
Honey honey, honey honey, where are you
I crossed the scalds in dessert, just to be where
You are
I want you need you love you, but still we're apart
When I want to hold you, oh my where are you
Honey honey, my honey honey, where can you be

When I want to hold you, oh my where are you
Honey honey, my honey honey, where can you be

I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay
How are things in Glocca Morra this fine day?

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?

How long, baby, how long 
Has that evening train been gone?
Baby how long, yes how long?
How long?

I went to the station
To watch my babe leave town
Feeling low and disgusted
For my baby couldn't be found

How long? How long, how long?

If I could holler
Like a mountain jack
I'd climb the highest mountain
To call my baby back
Oh, how long? Yes, how long, how long?

I hear the lords of wheels and poet
But I see no train
My heart is aching and breaking and I want it bad
But how long, yes how long, babe, how long?

One of these days and it won't be long
You're gonna look for me and I'll be gone
'Cause I believe (I believe, yes I believe)
I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
Well I believe to my soul now,
Tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it, I believe it)

Well you're goin' 'round here with your head so hard,
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod
'Cause I believe (I believe, yes I believe)
I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
Well I believe to my soul now
Tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it, I believe it)

Last night you were dreaming and I heard you say
"Oh, Johnny" when you know my name is Ray
That's why I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
Whoa I believe to my soul now
Tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it)

(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
(Dreams of yesterday)

Those happy hours that we once knew
Tho' long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

(Those happy hours)
Those happy hours
(That we once knew)
That we once knew
(Tho' long ago)
Tho' long ago
(Still make me blue)
Still ma-a-a-ake me blue
(They say that time)
They say that time
(Heals a broken heart)
Heals a broken heart
(But time has stood still)
Time has stood still
(Since we've been apart)
Since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I said I made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times

(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday
(Of yesterday)

I could have been a gambler
'Cause I'm good with the cards
I could have been a lover
Breakin' other's hearts
And I feel so silly
Bettin' on the dice
And a lover seldom sees
The same girl twice
And that is why (that is why)
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)
I chose to sing the blues, yes I did
Now, I could have been a doctor
Helping the sick
And I could have been a lawyer
But you know that ain't my stick
'Cause I feel so bad
If a patient didn't do well
And I feel just as bad
To leave a client in jail
And that is why (that is why)
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)
I chose to sing the blues

[Sax solo]

Now a man has a lot
That he could present
Just to think I could have been
President
But I can't understand
What politicians say
So I want to talk to you
In my own little way
And that is why (that is why)
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)
I chose to sing the blues
Yes I did, friends
Don't you know what I mean
I like what I'm doin'
You know, I like the blues
Everybody understands
What I mean when I say
Something like this here
Unnnnnnn-hoo
Yeah
Yeah-hoo
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout when I sing

I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

Once I was young...
Yesterday, perhaps...
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps.

Once I was young,
But never was naive.
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve.

And now I know I was naive.
I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,

How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
You hold my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,

And I'll say it was grand.
Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,

Hear your voice say I'm all your own.
I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was

Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now.
Once I was old --

Twenty years or so --
Rather well preserved:
The wrinkles did't show.
Once I was old,

But not too old for fun.
I used to hunt for little girls
Up my immaginary gun.
But now I ain for only one!

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what time it was
You hold my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,
And I'll say it was grand.

Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.

I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize.
I whanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.

I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now.

I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor, no, no
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I've been too long away from my baby, ahh!
I'm coming down with a misery
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor
for my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor, I tell ya now
for my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
Only my baby's arms,
Could ever take away this chill
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
Now the doctor say I need rest
(hey hey)
Before I need her tenderness
(hmmm hmm)
Put me on the critical list
(hey hey)
When all I need is her sweet kiss
(hmmm hmm)
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe
(It didn't soothe)
My emotion
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor, no, no
Wahhh! my hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
All I need is my baby
Baby, Please!
Won't you please come on home
(I don't need no doctor)
You know what I'm talkin' about?
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no mattress (?)
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no lotion
(I don't need no doctor)
I say, I don't need, no vitamin pills
(I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no lotion
(I don't need no doctor)
I say, I don't need, no vitamin pills
(I don't need no doctor)

That's good to me, oh yeah

She's there to love me
Both day and night
Never grumbles or fusses
Always treats me right
Never runnin' in the streets
Leavin' me alone
She knows a woman's place
Is right there, now, in her home

I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Say I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Oh, she's my baby, don't you understand
Yeah, I'm her lovin' man, now
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Well, don't you know she's all right
Well, don't you know she's all right
She's all right, she's all right

Well I have a feeling (I had a dream) things ain't going right (I had a dream)
Come over baby (I had a dream) let me tell you about my dream last night (I had a dream)
I dreamed someone else (I had a dream) was here with you (I had a dream)
Doing all the things (I had a dream) that I used to do (I had a dream)
Please don't let this dream come true (I had a dream) 
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream)
Baby, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)

Well, well you know I came home (I had a dream) and found you gone (I had a dream)
I never felt so (I had a dream) so all alone (I had a dream)
Oh with your voice (I had a dream) ringing in my ear (I had a dream)
I just could not hold (I had a dream) hold back my tear (I had a dream)
Please don't let it come true (I had a dream)
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream)
Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)

Well, well, well it seems (I had a dream) that you love me no more (I had a dream)
I never felt (I had a dream) felt this way before (I had a dream)
You were so cold (I had a dream) I wonder why (I had a dream)
You didn't care (I had a dream) how much I cried (I had a dream)
Baby please don't let it come true (I had a dream) 
Won't you say that I'm not losing you (I had a dream).
Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)

Well, well, you know I begged you (I had a dream) to come back fast (I had a dream)
You know without you baby (I had a dream) I know I couldn't last (I had a dream)
Oh, but you would not listen (I had a dream) listen to my plea (I had a dream)
You turned around (I had a dream) and walked away from me (I had a dream)
Now you know you can't let it come true now (I had a dream). 
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream). 
Won't you say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)

My world is like a river as dark as it is deep
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just and endless stream of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories

[Chorus]
Sweet memories
Sweet memories
 
She slipped into the silence of my dreams again last night
Wandering from room to room, she's turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories
 
[Chorus]

I don't want you to say pretty words
Makin' music like the sweet singing birds
I don't want you to be no fool
And don't treat me no special way, just say
"I love you so" now and then
'Cause if you really, really love me, yeah
I like to hear it some time
Sometimes you ought to take me in your arms
And say the words that I want to hear

You ought to sooth me with your magic charms
Call me "sweetheart", "darling" or "dear"!
I don't want you to beg or cry
A little affection would satisfy
I don't want you to be upset
I just want to hear you say
"I love you so" now and then
'Cause if you really, really love me, yeah
I like to hear it some time

I live only for you my love
Just as sure as the stars above
I love you, I love you, I always will
I will not let you go

I dream only of you my love
You're the only girl that I ever think of
I love you, I love you, 'n I always will
I will not let you go

Sometimes when I am lonely
Have nothing to do or say
Thinking of you only
Helps to pass my lonely time away

I'd like to sit around and sing to you my love
Just moan like a mourning dove
You see, I love you, I love you, I always will
I will not let you

Sometimes when I am lonely
Have nothing to do or say
Thinking of you only
Helps to pass my lonely time away

I'd like to sing to you my love
Just hum like a mourning dove
Oh, I love you, I crave you, 'n I always will
I will not let you go, no, no!
I will not let you go

I know he'll never be forgotten
He was a king uncrowned
I know I'll always remember
The warmth of his sound
Lingering long I'm sure he's still around
For those who heard they respect him yet
So those who hear won't forget
The sound of each phrase
Echoing time uncountable by days
The things he played are with us now
And they'll endure should time allow
Oh yes I remember Clifford
I seem to always fed him near somehow
Every day I hear his lovely tone
In every trumpet sound that has a beauty all its own
So how can we say something so real has really gone away?
I hear him now, I always will
Believe me I remember Clifford still.

Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear And shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

I want a little girl, call my own.
She must be someone who's all alone now.
Say, I want a little girl to fall in love with me, oh yeah.

I want a little girl, but she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book.
If she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T.

And she don't have to wave her hair
Or even wear fancy clothes, I wouldn't even care.
She don't wear nylon hose, oh.

I want a little girl to love a lot.
You know that I'd give her everything I got.
I want a little girl to fall in love with me.

Reading old magazines,
I'm on the road no one to save me girl,
I wish you were here tonight,
There's a knock on my door,
Yes, it's time to give another show,
I wish you were here tonight.

Chorus

My love is all imagination,
Just a dream without you to make it real,
And, baby, I got a dream,
Burning inside,
No one else around,
Just you and I,
Loving in the fire,
It made us so right,
And I wish you were here tonight.

The T.V is a friend,
'cause I can choose the show with a happy end,
That never ends,
Forever and ever more,
If I make believe your on the show,
Your the lover that says she has to go,
And I end up wishing you were here tonight.

Chorus

You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long-ago
And each has meant heaven to you
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn
And have sworn to them all you'd be true

You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune
Then you've left her to hunt a new game
Does it ever occur to you later, my boy
That she's probably doing the same?

If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue
Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed

But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year

I wonder who's kissing her now
I wonder who's teaching her how
I wonder who's looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs, telling lies

I wonder who's buying the wine for lips
That I used to call mine
I wonder if she ever tells him of me
I wonder who's kissing her now

I want to know, baby
Just how you feel, girl
Said I want to know
If what you feel is real, girl

'Cause there's a reason
For the things that I say, what I talk about
But oh, I want to love ya girl
In a special way, come 'ere woman

          We've been together, for so very long
          I'd hate to break up, break up my happy home

(The way we stand and the way we lie)
The way we lie
(The way we love and the way we cry)
Girl, we cry
(Of all these things, there comes a time)
There's a time
(Makes me feel that it's worth a try)
Makes me feel
(I'll be good to you)

(Good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)

Girl you said, we've been together
So very long, very long
I would hate to break up, break up my happy home
          Let me take off your shoes
          Take a stand, now, and let me know how
          Oooh always, baby always, and all your know-how, baby

(The way we stand and the way we lie)
          Um-hum the way we lie
(The way we love and the way we cry)
          The wa-ay-ay-ay, we cry
(Of all these things, there comes a time)
          Oooo
(Makes me feel that it's worth a try)
          Oooo
(I'll be good to you, good to ya, good to ya)
          I'll be good
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)

(Good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
     {I'll be good}
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
     {So good, to you}
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
     {I'll be good}
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)
     {So good, to you}

Girl, I'll be good to you, baby
why'know I'll be good to you
Take you shopping, you know what I mean baby, anything you want
I'll be good to you
I'll give it up, with my credit cards,
Like Visa, MasterCharge, American Express,
Turn my pants upside down
Any day of the week
Ow-oh, you, you, you
Come here, give me love
Talk to me

(Good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
Girl I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)
I'll be good to you, I said I will, I ain't lying, baby
          Oooo-hoo

(Good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
     {I'll be good}
I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
     {So good, to you}
Girl, I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
I'll be good to you
     {I'll be good}
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya)
I'll be good to you, I said I will, I ain't lying, baby
     {So good, to you}

          Oooo-ooo
(Good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)
     {I'll be good}
Good to you, yeah!
(I'll be good to ya, I'll be good to ya, good to ya)
     {So good, to you}
Yeah! Yeah! I'll be
(I'll be good to ya, good to ya, good to ya)

     {I'll be good}
Whoo-hoo, well I'll be
I'll be good to you, I said I will, I ain't lying, baby
     {So good, to you}
I'll be good to you

I'll never stand in your way
I'll never stand in your way

If you ever found someone new
Who means more than me to you
Well, I'll never stand in your way
(I'll never stand in your way)

If you feel we must part
Don't let pity rule your heart
Because I'll never stand in your way

I love you much too much to ever lose you
(Ever lose you)
But what is to be will be and I'll obey
(I'll obey)

I'll be blue when you go
But I'll never let it show
And I'll never let it stand in your way

You see, I love you much too much to ever lose you
(To ever lose you)
But what is to be will be and I'll obey
(I'll obey)

I'll be blue when you go
But I'll never let it show
And I'll never let it stand in your way
(I'll never stand in your way)

I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low

I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light

You've found a new love
And you say it's divine
I've glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine

I hear you saying
It's the real thing inside
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine

Oh, how it hurts my pride
To have to step aside
And watch somebody new
Taking my place with you

But if you're happy
I don't care if I pine
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine

I'm goin down to the river and drown myself, well
I'm goin down to the river and drown myself
Oh babe, oh I'm goin down yes and turn myself in,
Cause my baby's lovin someone else
Now you know why I'm goin down to the river and drown
Myself

I'm sick and tired of this misery down in my heart,
Way down in my heart
I'm sick and tired of this misery down in my heart, oh
Lord
Well I'm sick and tired of this misery, lord have
Mercy, have mercy on me
I'm sick and tired of this misery down in my heart

So goodbye baby ( bye baby ) well I got to go, so
Please dont cry, cause its too late to cry
Bye bye baby well I got to go, so please dont cry,
Oh no
Oh bye bye baby, I've got to go, thats why I called
You, just to let you know
I'm goin down to the river and drown myself

She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding

[Chorus]
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row

She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit

[Chorus]

So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band

For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
Yes it's fools gold

When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your f me pumps
And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to

'Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
'Cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife

You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night-stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right

In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed

You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big baller
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You can't sit down right
'Cause you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers

So you did Miami
'Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting cane

Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives

Don't be mad at me
'Cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps

Simple sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
Some kind of laid back feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

Whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, oh

He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks, What's she running from?

Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies

Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be

Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies

So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her it never dies

So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies

When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
There must have been but I don't care
I feel the way your soul does there

Darling they empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Be slight nobody can be that wise

I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
You can get so much from me
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You've got the degree in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me
('Cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen

(Drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
(What do you want)

To hold your head above the sea
(Keep you high and dry)
And carry you even though you're bigger
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure

And anyway we're still so young
(Yeah I'm so young)
And this isn't yet the day

I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
(You won't help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone yeah
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years oh most of the time
And I'm, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
You are like nothing that I ever knew

I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco, where everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl, and only having fun
Your worn out dresses, got stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a date unknown

But you were just a rich girl, hardly having fun
Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, I wrote this song
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong

At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache, because the screen star was you
You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams

You were a rich girl, and only having fun
But your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

I couldn't resist him
His eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down

You are everything he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect?
You left me here alone; I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely

How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you I guess he looked like you
No he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating; you were on my mind

Yes he looked like you
But I heard love is blind

Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
Its not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing

Its something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone the sun comes up
Your still clinging to that notion

Every thing is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There is nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mines a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed

I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did

Now its not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right
Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed

You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man,
Not pal in comparison to who you think I am,

You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair!

'cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy,
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy,

You should be stronger than me,
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey,
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role,
Always wanna talk it through- I'm ok,
Always have to comfort you every day,
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay?

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy

He said 'the respect I made you earn - 
Thought you had so many lessons to learn'
I said 'You don't know what love is - get a grip!' -
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna rip your body over mine
So tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy

Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger
Than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
try, cry
why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream
Dream

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you
Nobody knows where my johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine

Play all my records keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Till johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile

Judy and johnny just walked through that door
Like a queen with her king
Oh what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

When will we get
The time to be
Just friends?

It's never safe for us
Not even in the evening
'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning
When your shit works
It's always dangerous
When everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
Can we be alone?
Can we be alone?

When will we get
The time to be
Just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends?

And, no, I'm not ashamed
But the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
Thought we need to find a time
To just do this shit together
'Fore it gets worse
I want to touch you
But that just hurts

When will we get
The time to be
Just, just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends, just friends?

When will we get
The time to be
Just friends, just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends, just friends?

Just friends

You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need your nerve to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
As you were

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about, yeah

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and them
I gotta know you now and then

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
But I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, oh

It's not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
I'll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
Fun to punctuate, pronounciate the funds I make
The miles I take put in your face
Oh my mistake, you're not a floozy
Then excuse me
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
Y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary
I kick the narrative, this is legendary
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess
I hold a lady's interest, I just met
The love scholar, she's the teacher's pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumphant, no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin' for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can't stand it
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? 'Cause I'm deemed a heart breaker
Like smoke, girls linger 'round a player, yaya

I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hang around in the unbalanced
Woah, oh

Yo, this recession is a test
It's affecting my complexion
Misdirectin' my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I'm IEG
Those fly suites and my bourgeoisie
Tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you're so deep
I said, no let's go through it
Historically so ruthless as feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classifies me as a whore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy, in her dismay
She's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
And it's a dragon, it's a bastard you're in tune with, just lust
I'm through with you after my crush
So is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, "Yeah"
You know how me and Amy are, straight players

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hang around in the unbalanced
Woah, oh

For you I was the flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game

One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Nobody stands in between me and my man
It's me and Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of **** is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig
(Oh, Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did
(When I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that
(Out)

No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss
(All them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this
(To yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself like this
(Out)

Rulers one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of **** are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me
(Dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me
(Make it up)
Who's playing Saturday?

What kind of **** are you?
Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew
(Best black Jew)
But I could swear that we were through
(We were through)
I still wonder 'bout the things you do

Mr. Destiny 9 and 14
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)
Me and

Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke

Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Yeah, 'cause you come naturally

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love, love, love (Mister Magic)
I see you through the smoke

Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke
 
Mister Magic
Mister Magic
Mister Magic, waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear

Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
Sung for my Ava every night

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise

With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise

Our day will come (our day will come)
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy (we'll share the joy)
Falling in love can bring

No one can tell me that I'm too young to know (young to know)
I love you so (love you so)
And you love me

Our day will come (our day will come)
If we just wait a while
No tears for us (no tears for us)
Think love and wear a smile

Our dreams have magic because we'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come (our day will come, our day will come)

Our dreams have magic because we'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come (our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come (our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come (our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come (our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come

They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with a Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know we don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, "no, no, no"
Yes, I been black

He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go

The man said, "why do you think you here?
I said, I got no idea.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, I just think you're depressed
This, me, yeah, baby, and the rest

They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I don't ever want to drink again
I just, oh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

And it's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab

If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side, and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow

Put it in writing
But who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting, my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, whoa, whoa

If, if my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dying for?
B, I would have died too
I'd have liked to
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting

There's a saying old 
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told 
"Seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek 
A certain lad 
I've had in mind

Looking everywhere 
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair 
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think 
Of with regret

I'd like 
To add his initial 
To my monogram
Tell me 
Where is the shepherd 
For this lost lamb?

There's a somebody 
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns 
Out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb 
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could 
Always be good
To one 
Who'll watch over me

Although he may 
Not be the man some 
Girls think 
Of as handsome
To my heart 
He carries the key

Won't you tell him please 
To put on some speed
Follow my lead 
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please 
To put on some speed
Follow my lead 
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me

You should be stronger than me
You've been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always want to talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
You always want to talk it through, I'm okay
I always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said "the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn"
I said "You don't know what love is get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script"
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just want to grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me

Your neighbors were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box

Take the box

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't want to be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you

Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'
I think I love you

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it
Take the box
Just take it, take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box

Did you say I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think, I'm tryin' not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Oh, teach me tonight

Let's start with the A B C of it
Roll right down to the X Y Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a black board
High above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Come on and teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me, please, teach me tonight

All I can ever be to you,
Is a darkness that we knew,
And this regret I had to get accustomed to,
Once it was so right,
When we were at our high,
Waiting for you in the hotel at night,
I knew I hadn't met my match,
But every moment we could snatch,
I don't know why I got so attached,
It's my responsibility,
And you don't owe nothing to me,
But to walk away I have no capacity

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And in this grey, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own,

I don't understand,
Why do I stress a man,
When there's so many better things at hand,
We could a never had it all,
We had to hit a wall,
So this is inevitable withdrawal,
Even if I stop wanting you,
A perspective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon,

I shouldn't play myself again,
I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men,

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own,

So we are history,
Your shadow covers me
The sky above,
A blaze

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own,

I wish I could say no regrets,
And no emotional debts,
And as we kiss goodbye the sun sets,
So we are history,
The shadow covers me,
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see,

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own,

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry on their own

He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry

There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but everytime your near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
and get a release from this awful misery

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My heart's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never knew what love was all about
James Moody would you come on hit me,
you can blow now if you want to, I'm through

Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah!

When she moves it's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah!

Oh but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
He would just give his heart gladly

But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he

Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
He smiles
But she doesn't see
No she doesn't see
She just doesn't see

To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile

To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
And I do
And I do

Oh I'll be good to him
I'll bring joy to him oh oh
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him

To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I really do
And I do

Why can't he see?
How blind here he be?
Someday he'll see
That he was meant just for me, oh oh oh oh

To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile

To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I really do
And I do

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?

'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Why don't come over Valerie?

It's okay in the day
I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself, I do a one-eighty
I stay up, clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears 'soon as the sun sets

He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop, the sleep catches up
And I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me, and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him (before him, I)
It's all I can do to assure him (assure him)
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light

He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone

Understand once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hated
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal agression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all

It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?

It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?

Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star

I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow

Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good

Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh huh

And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase
But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be

Although my pride, yeah, is  not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans, yeah and your Beasties tee, yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this, no with you next to me yeah yeah

His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
But I never hated myself, for my age so much, yeah

And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb, yeah
So with your battered jeans, yeah, and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me, yeah

And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me

You're wonderin' now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wonderin' how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved

First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

You're wonderin' now, what to do, now you know this is the end

First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

You're wonderin' now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wonderin' how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved

You're wonderin' now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved

You're wonderin' now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need
To see me through

Sometimes it seems the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need
To see me through

When food is gone you are my daily meal, oh
When friends are gone I know my savior's love is real
Your love is real

'Cause you got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Time after time I think "Oh Lord what's the use?"
Time after time I think it's just no good
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love you loose
But you got the love I need
To see me through

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through

Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy

There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
He that lame, you love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yet you know that I'm no good

It begins to tell 'round midnight
'Round midnight
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And old midnight knows it too

When some quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darling I need you
Lately I find
You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind

Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around

Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around

There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

Tell your boyfriend next time he around
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if brave would give me some more
I'd rather him leave you than leave him my draw
When you smoke all my weed man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours

Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security team

When you smoke all my weed man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine and you get yours

I'm my own man
So when will you learn
That you got a man but I gots to burn
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself and smoke my homegrown
Its got me addicted, does more than any dick did

Yeah I can get mine and you get yours
Yeah I can get mine and you get yours

Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
Distract me, stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair.

Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculin you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel

It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness from the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track

Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before

Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel

His own style, right down to his diesel jeans
Imobile, I can't think by any means
Underwhere peeks at the top
I'll let you know where you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you

Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel

Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize

Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel
Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel

Mmm yeah
Oooooh, yeah

[Chorus x2:]
B boy, be my baby (won't you be my baby)
My one and only baby (be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby (be my baby now)
My one and only baby (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

It was winnin' time, you know what they say
Did you think about us, did you miss your baby?
I'ma catch the train, guess I'm headin' your way
You're my number one, that's all, a newborn son
Won't you be my king? (won't you be my king?)

'Cause I know you care, I'll dirty dance for you
And when I'm done I'm gonna do it again
And when it's over I'ma pull you closer
Keep your Nikes on, you know how we do
There's nothing he won't try
We're like two stars in the sky

You are my rainy day, sunshine
It's plain to see
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please

[Chorus]

Put two in the air if you feel like me
Someone who cares feels so freaky
In demand by all the ladies
He's not for sale, he's being home-delivered to me
So hang up for your trying cards, please (he's my baby)

Love-sick calls, that's what I get
I hear his voice and things get wet
Knows what I want, then he'll fetch
He's my boo and I'm his little pet, his little pet
You never know what he'll do next, he's my baby

My rainy days, my sunshine
Living fantasy
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please

[Chorus x2]

He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow, and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to

Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
I go back to
I go back to

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to black

I can't wait to get away from you
Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends, right?

You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you?re home at night
But we're best friends right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?

I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right?

You?re Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro'
Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right?

I would die before I divorce you
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kiss a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
'Cause anyone who will see us
Through our victory and done defeat
Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats

Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh

My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still make this housewife blush
So I'm holding my hand in his
I'm sitting on the royal flush
Women drink him in, swimming in his green eyes
Then go home and catch the chips you got
And take a bad beat to ooh to boat oh!
The jack of hearts is my jackpot

Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh

Catch me on, have to ?
And I know as my heart beats
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats

Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance, oh oh oh oh
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender, myself to you, body and soul

Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender, myself to you, body and soul

My heart is sad and lonely 
For you I sigh, for you dear only 
Why haven't you seen it 
I'm all for you body and soul 
I spend my days in longin' 
And wondering why it's me you're (ogling) 

I tell you I mean it 
I'm all for you body and soul 
I can't believe it 
It's hard to conceive it 
That you turn away romance 
Are you pretending 
It looks like the ending 
And less I could have one more chance to prove, dear 

My life a wreck you're making 
You know I'm yours for just the taking 
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul 
My life a wreck you're making 
You know I'm yours for just the taking 
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Brother
There's so much that I could never say to your face
Bye, bye now
You should know the world and all its ways so find your place

How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend
A son not a sob story

(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were

She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now well life turns around
My brother

Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like its so run through

(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
Your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were

(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were

The way we were, we'll never be
And your priority, it must be heard

Tommy Mottola, lives on the road
He lost his lady, two months ago
Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't
Oh wonder that love

Brothers try to pass me, but none could match me
No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, STOP! (Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these (She's a hottie, hottie)

Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of rats
I know they are over

One in the head, I'm fed, this is how we doin
Put a Ruff Rider on my dick, bust right through 'em
Come out your shirt, insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr. Buzzard, Bacardi Lime
We passin it, takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist, taste and follow mine
Swallow nine, model dimes from Bahamas
Slim doo-doo makers stuffed inside pajamas

They'll take all your rhymes with a Colgate smile, hey baby
They'll love you one second, then hate you the next
Oh ain't it crazy baby, yeah
Tony's his name, the undefeated champion, whoa, yeah (Blow 'em down God)
Now he's alone, he's just the king of his throne (Yeah, aha)
Always will be my friend, Ghostface Killah (Truly yours, peace boo)

Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down

And you're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you're stubborn as a mule

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar

Only paid attention in your lessons
I Sat close at the front so I could see
Your enthusiastic demonstrations
Teaching to a class of only me
And I couldn't speak directly to you
Without stuttering or turning red
So looking back I don't know how I handled it, yeah
Futile frustration in my head

[Chorus]
I can't help but analyze your actions,
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

Hated it when I saw them together
I sat around waiting for shit to end
Unconsciously I tried to sabotage it
To get revenge on my best friend
Because I was in love with him before her
I had just cause to grieve
So not long after she broke up with him
I got my closure on new years eve

[Chorus: x2]

I love all the bickering and insults
And when I shout at you and you smile
Making coffee while my mind spills over
How I catch your art once in a while
Shouldn't I have grown a little wiser?
Why haven't I learned my lesson yet?
And although I have made my love progresses
I tend to learn as much as I forget

[Chorus: x3]

Cupid, draw back your bow.
And let your arrow flow.
Straight to my lovers heart for me.
Nobody but me.
Cupid, please hear my cry.
And let your arrow fly.
Straight to my lovers heart, for me.

I don't want to bother you but I'm in distress.
There's danger of me losing all my happiness.
I love a man who doesn't know I exist.
And this you can fix.

Cupid, draw back your bow.
And let your arrow flow.
Straight to my lovers heart for me.
Nobody but me.
Cupid, please hear my cry.
And let your arrow fly.
Straight to my lovers heart, hold me

Now if your arrow makes his love strong for me.
I swear I'm gonna love him 'til eternity.
I know between the both of us, his heart we can steal.
Cupid help me if you will

So Cupid, draw back your bow.
And let your arrow flow.
Straight to my lovers heart for me.
Nobody but me.
Cupid, please hear my cry.
And let your arrow fly.
Straight to my lovers heart, for me

Yeah, Cupid.
Oh, Cupid.
Mm mm, Cupid.

Got back together with my man last night
But I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips

I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how

Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good

It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight

I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how

Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good

Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me

Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me

For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go

So
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me

When you walk in the bar, 
And you dressed like a star, 
Rockin' your F me pumps. 

And the men notice you, 
With your Gucci bag crew, 
Can't tell who he's lookin' to. 

Cause you all look the same, 
Everyone knows your name, 
And that's you whole claim to fame. 

Never miss a night, 
Cause your dream in life, 
Is to be a footballers wife. 
You don't like players, 
That's what you say-a, 
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. 

You don't like ballers, 
They don't do nothing for ya, 
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller. 

You're more than a fan, 
Lookin' for a man, 
But you end up with one-nights-stands. 

He could be your whole life, 
If you got past one night, 
But that part never goes right. 

In the morning you're vexed, 
He's onto the next, 
And you didn't even get no taste. 

Don't be too upset, 
If they call you a skank, 
Cause like the news everyday you get pressed. 

You don't like players, 
That's what you say-a, 
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. 

Or them big ballers, 
Don't do nothing for ya. 
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller, 

You can't sit down right, 
Cause you jeans are too tight, 
And your lucky its ladies night. 

With your big empty purse, 
Every week it gets worse, 
At least your breasts cost more than hers. 

So you did Miami, 
Cause you got there for free, 
But somehow you missed the plane. 

You did too much E, 
Met somebody, 
And spent the night getting caned. 

Without girls like you, 
There'd be no fun, 
We'd go to the club and not see anyone. 

Without girls like you, 
There's no nightlife, 
All those men just go home to their wives. 

Don't be mad at me, 
Cause you're pushing thirty, 
And your old tricks no longer work. 

You should have known from the job, 
That you always get dumped, 
So dust off your fuck me pumps

You better beware, my friends all told me
When they saw that I was falling for you
You better beware they told me that girl ain't gonna be true
She'll have you walking with your head in the air
Have you thinking that she really, really care
Then a, then she'll let you down, she'll really let you down
She's a girl with no understanding
And when she's getting tired of you hanging around
She'll let you drop and say have a happy landing (happy landing)

Oh but I fell for you anyway
I didn't care what my friends have to say
'Cause I was so glad that I had found you
I build my whole world right around you
You had me hope on a lie for awhile
Have me thinking you'd be mine for awhile
Oh, then you let me down, you really let me down
'Cause you're a girl with no understanding
And when you're getting tired of me hanging around
You let me drop and said have a happy landing (happy landing)

So now you want me to take you there
Staying away for a long, long time
You won't call it a lost of loving
Now ya coming back to the scene of your crime
Gonna keep you in suspense for awhile
Keep you hanging on a fence for awhile
Then a I'll let you down, then I'll let you down
I ain't gonna have no understanding
And when I get tired of you hanging around
I'll let you drop and say you have a happy landing (happy landing)
Have a happy landing, now (have a happy landing)
I've got to put you down (have a happy landing)
Don't want ya hanging around, now (have a happy landing)
You know that you better (have a happy landing)
You know that you better (have a happy landing)
So come on and have (have a happy landing)
Don't you know that I ought to

Saw you there and your laughter seemed to fill the air
A scent like perfume from your lovely hair
I said that I do adore

My heart said to me, don't walk head on into misery
Hey, with your eyes wide open can't you see?
A hurts in store just like before

Oh ho ho, but here I go again walking into love
Here I go again never thinking of
The danger that might exist
Disregarding all of this just for you

I ignore the detour sign
I won't stop until you're mine
I'm past the point of no return

Girl, you walk by and I said to me, myself and I
Now we've got to give it one more try
I know somehow the time is now, right now

Oh whoa, here I go again walking into love
Here I go again walking into love

Here I go, here I go
Here I go, here I go again

I am, I am

Lord, who will be with you
Every day, all the way, come with me
Your? come through
Thick and thin, back again
I'm gonna hang right in

[Chorus]
I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah

I'll be standin' by
Prepared to take
Some heartache, for your sake
Can you did that, baby

What kind of fool am I
When winding up?
When the going gets rough
Can you did that, mama

[Chorus]

And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

Why do you give your love
And like?
Through youth and age
Can you dig that, baby?

What of the life you?
Realize your dreams
Though it may seem
Too extreme
Can you dig that mama?

[Chorus]

And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

I am, I am I am
I am I am I am, I am
Oh baby, I am I am I am
Oh, you bet your life I am

And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

Every now and then
Somebody comes into my life
Oh, and for a little while
It seems they're the answer to my dreams
To my prayer

As sudden as they come
They start to fade
Like floating smoke rings
Oh, how can they stay with me when
They're only penciled in
You're always there

So all my love
If you can find it in your heart
To do just one thing for me
Come back (Come back), come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back), come back

I don't wanna look
When I know where
Just what I need is
Oh, honey, you've got it with you
So what else can I do
But come to you, my love and say

Take me in your arms
Hold me close
I need to feel you

Oh, to me there's nothin like your touch
It's what I need so much
Oh, yes, I do, my love

So if you feel the need
To ever be with me again
Don't let another moment pass
Come back (Come back), come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back), come back

(I can't find) My way to a very special somewhere
(I can't find) Myself ?cause without you, I'm just out there
(I can't find) That person I wanna put that much in
(I can't find) Anybody like you who makes touchin' more than touchin'

I've been lookin'
There's just nobody around, ooh
No sense lookin'
For who can never be found

Mmm...

So if you feel the need
To ever be with me again
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Come back (Come back), come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back), come back

(I can't find) Sleep at night, I'm either watchin' TV or walkin'
(I can't find) Any conversation that means more to me than talkin'
(I can't find) Satisfaction even when I do surrender
(I can't find) Anybody like you who makes tender more than tender

I've been lookin'
There's just nobody around, oh
No sense lookin'
For who can never be found, oh, oh...

(I can't find) Anybody like you who gets my full attention
(I can't find) Anybody who means enough for me to mention
(I can't find) That person

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool 
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool 
No no no no no 
I'm only payin' the price for a trip I took to paradise 
'Cause I looked into a pair of eyes 
And what I thought was the look of love was only hurt in disguise 
Too bad I didn't realize, oh but don't apologize, no, 'cause
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool 
I should've did it myself 
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool 
No no no no no 
I think it's pretty plain (pretty plain), holdin' you would take a ball and chain (ball and chain)
Every bet I made was all in vain 
'Cause what I thought was an ocean of love (ocean of love, ocean of love) was just a wee drop of rain 
Too bad that it couldn't rain, oh but you don't have to explain, no, 'cause
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool 
I should've did it myself 
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool 
No no no no no 
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool 
That's the thing to do 
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool 
No no no no no
Yeah, oh yeah yeah, ooh hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh
I said, what I thought was sure to last, to last was just a minute instead 
Too bad that I got misled (too bad, too bad), ah but you don't have to hang your head, ah 'cause
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool 
I should've did it myself 
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool 
No no no no no 
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool 
'Cause that's the thing to do 
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool 
No no no no no

Come on everybody
Gather 'round my friends here
Help me forget my hurtin' tears
About the only girl I ever loved
The only one baby
I gotta dance to keep from cryin' (crying)

Do the twist (do the twist)

Ooh, you've got the wrong girl 
I think you're makin' up too much noise
So get soft, oh, just a little bit soft
Oh, just a little bit soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, just a little bit soft, soft, soft
Guess, I turn it up, I, guess I turn it up, I, guess I turn it up, higher, just a little bit
Come on and dance with me, swing, dance with me swing
I do that move, I do that move,

I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before 
Between the two of us guys 
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say 
When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself 
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
I'm just about to love my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah

I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through

I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime
Going to the movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
When I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose
It needs the sun and rain
Oh, I need your sweet love
To beat all the pain

I just don't know what to do with myself
I just don't know what to do with myself
Baby, if your new love ever turns you down
Come back, I will be around
Just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do

Like a summer rose
It needs the sun and rain
Oh, I need your sweet love
To beat all the pain

I don't know just what to do with myself
I don't know just what to do with myself
Baby, if your new love ever turns you down
Come on back, I will be around
Just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do, no, no, no
I don't know what else to do
I'm still so crazy for you, no, no, no, no
I don't know what else to do, no, no, no
I'm still so crazy for you

Clap your hands now everybody
We're gonna have some fun tonight
We're gonna sing, shout, knock ourselves out
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

Now let the bassman start playin'
He's gonna come in right on time
He's gonna add a beat to make you pat your feet
Everything's gonna work out fine 

And we can say I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, that's where it's at and I like it like that

Now after a man finds himself a woman
She doesn't have to be a beauty queen
And then she holds you tight, she makes you feel alright
Any man that I've ever seen

He's got to say, I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, I like it like that (oh, I like it like that)
Oh, that, I'm trying to tell you  (oh, that's where it's at, that's where
It's at, oh, that's where it's at) and I like it like that

I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)

Yeah, ooh, now I know why my mama, taught me to be true
She must have known one day that you would come my way
And I would fall in love with you

And we could say I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, I like it like that (oh, I like it like that)
(Oh, that's (I'm trying to tell you) where it's at, that's where it's at,
Everybody  sing now(that's where it's at, that's where it's at)
(That's where it's at) one more time now (that's where it's at, that's where it's at)

I love your face
I love the way you smile at me
An open door that lets the sunshine in
It lights my world, my days
I love your face
I love the look that's in your eyes
You see right through the deepest part of me,
Right down into the heart of me
I love your face

Don't you ever change
You're just right for me
I love all of you
And especially I love your face
I love the message there for me
The greatest love story I ever heard
Without a sound, without a word
I love your face
I love your face
I love your face

Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'll go away and never call, darling
And a taste of honey is worse that none at all
Oh little girl

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools
And so you think it's wise to break the rules
Oh little girl

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Oh, alright
In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion, baby
I second that emotion
Say, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
Oh, baby, I second that emotion

Every day that passes by
I think about the new love you found
And my eyes cloud up and cry 
'cause I want you 'round
I want you 'round
I spend my saddest moments
After the sun goes down
That's when my heart starts aching
'cause I want you 'round 
I want you round
No matter where I travel
In the country or a town
My lips call out your name 
'cause I want you 'round
I want you 'round baby
I want you 'round
I want you 'round

I will build you a castle with a tower so high 
It reaches the moon 
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly 
And compose you a tune 
Give you lovin' warm as mama's oven 
And if that don't do 
Then I'll try something new 

I will take you away with me as far as I can 
To Venus or Mars 
There we will love with your hand in my hand 
You'll be queen of the stars 
And every day we can play on the milky way 
And if that don't do 
Then I'll try something new 

I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea 
To wear in your hair 
I'll do anything and everything to keep you happy 
Girl, to show you that I care 
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellas 
And if that don't do 
Then I'll try something new 

I'll take the stars and count 'em and move a mountain 
And if that don't do, I'll try something new 
I'll tell the moon above it's you that I love 
And baby, if it don't do I'm gonna try something new

Oh, well if there's something to see, try, here's what I'll do
Always trying something new, always trying something that's new

I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love

Now you say every time you need some affection
The one you love goes in another direction
And you just sit there in a daze reminiscing
When you know some other lips he's been kissing

Now when you need the love he's never shown you come round here
And when you need some loving arms to hold you come round here
Now I may not be the one you want
Oh But I know I'm the one you need
Said I may not be the one you want
Ooh but I know I'm the one you need

Your life stands still the minute he goes
You count the hours just hoping he shows
Girl can't you see while you're longing for his touch
That I'm the one who loves you so much
While you're longing for his embrace
You're all alone there with tears on your face

Now when you feel the need to cry to someone cry to me
And when you feel the need to lean on someone lean on me
Now I may not be the one you want but I sure 'nuff the one you need
Oh baby I may not be the one you want ooh but I know I'm the one you need

Now the days the days you sit alone by yourself
He's out fooling round with somebody else
Leaving you alone here with nothing to do
Just waiting 'till he has time for you

Now when the loneliness gets hard to bear girl come round here
And when you need a little tender loving care girl come round here
Now I may not be the one you want
But I know I'm the one you need

I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality, step up, wake up to reality?
But each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin.
Yes, I've got you under my skin.

I've made love to you a thousand times,
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

It's so real, when I dream about you
I can feel you in the morning
All day long the feeling of my dream
Comes on me without warning
I'm standing there, and suddenly
There you are all over me

I've made love to you a thousand times,
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

Let it be, let it really happen
Set me free form loves desire
And if my imagination is any indication
Then of your love I'll never tire
Oh, hold me close, kiss me sweet, 
And repeat and repeat and repeat

And after I've made love to you a thousand times
And after I've made love to you a thousand ways
I'm gonna gonna keep on with the real thing
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

I've made love to you a thousand times,
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

Then I wanna keep on with the real thing
Keep on with the real thing
Keep on keep on keep on with the real thing
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

For a thousand nights and a thousand nights
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

For a thousand nights and a thousand nights
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

For a thousand nights and a thousand nights
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

Oh 
Oh, you may not love me now but I'm stayin' around 
'Cause you want my company 
Just like push can turn to shove, like can turn to love 
And it's my philosophy that 
If you can want, you can need 
And if you can need, you can care 
If you can care, you can love 
When you want me I'll be there 
Whenever you want me, I'll be there 
Oh, now this may take some time, but if time was money 
I would be a millionare 
So whenever you want me call, any time at all 
And for sure I'll be right there, 'cause 
If you can want, you can need 
And if you can need, baby, you can care 
If you can care, you can love 
So when you want me I'll be there 
(I'll be there) when ever you want me, oh yeah
I'll be standin' by, not far way 
Let your mind give me a sign 
'Cause I'm prepared to wait until that future date 
When you'll want me all the time, 'cause 
If you can want, you can need 
And if you can need, you can care 
If you can care, you can love 
So when you want me I'll be there 
(I'll be there) when ever you want me 
You can want, you can need
You can need, you can care
You can care, you can love
So when you want me I'll be there
I'll be there, whenever you want me (you can want)

Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday,
Happy Birthday to you.

A few years ago on my birthday,
I had just become twenty-one (I remember).
I had a lot to live, said I had a lot to give,
Til a man comes to give me a gun.

And though that war he sent me to didn't claim me,
If I'm bitter don't blame me.
It's just my Soul responding.

Don't you try to tell me I'm un-patriotic.
I deserve an explanation!
I can't help but wonder,
If you really got it.

It's just my Soul responding, 
Soul responding, 
Soul responding

This land once belonged to my father,
And to his father before him too.
Let me tell you now, I'm on a reservation,
Living in a state of degradation.
What's a Soul suppose to do?

Cause I'm out,
Pushin, right?
I'm not in doubt.
When it's just my Soul responding,

To seeing little hungry children in the "Land of Plenty".
Just my Soul responding.
To doing lots of deeds.
But never having any.

It's just my Soul responding, 
Soul responding, 
Soul responding

I was born and raised in the ghetto,
On the run down side of the track.
And there are forces who do everything they can do,
To hold me back because my skin is black.

Oh, but more and more I mind!
Hell, It's about time!
It's just my Soul responding,
To being second-class in a land I helped to form
Just my Soul responding,

To too many roaches and not enough heat to keep my babies warm.
In this land I helped to form,
I've got too many roaches, and not enough heat to keep my babies warm.

It's just my Soul responding, 
Soul responding, 
Soul responding

Just to see her
Just to touch her
Just to hold her in my arms again one more time

If I could feel her warm embrace
See her smiling face
Can't find anyone to take her place
I've got to see her again

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again

I can't hide it no
I can't fight it
It's so hard to live without the love she gave to me

Doesn't she know it
I tried hard not to show it
Can't I make her realize that she really needs me again

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
She brightened up my everyday
Made me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
I've got to see her again

(Just to see her)
I want to see her
(Just to see her)
Hold her hold her hold her
(Just to see her) see her
Just to touch her
Touch her

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
She brightened up my everyday
Makes me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay (today)
I've got to see her again

(Just to see her) it would it would it would
(Just to see her) make me feel so good
(Just to see her)if I if I could only see her again
Just see her again
Just to see her theres nothin' I wouldn't do
Just to see her oh don't you know its true
Just to see her (if I could only see her again oh)

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

Oh... Oh...

Let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah
Let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time

I'm a cuckoo I know
Counting hours till we will be together
When the door to my heart will open
It's for sure that I will be hopin', hopin' that you

Will let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, baby, oh, yeah, babe
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time
Let it begin

Cause every moment we're apart
Is some good feeling wasted
A good feeling deep down inside me told me
A good time for me to try to get you to hold me
Is right here and now so

Let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, baby
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time, for the first time

I wanna be your pendulum, baby
Striking your chime

Hickory dickory dock
I want to be your clock
Just set me for lifetime
And I'll wake you up every morning

Woo... Woo... Oh... Let me
(Let me be the clock for the time of your life)
For the time of your life (Oh, yeah), oh, yeah, oh...
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime for the first time
And every time after that cause I know where it's at

So let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, baby, ooh, ooh
And let me be the pendulum striking your chime for the first time
For the first time

And every time after that ?cause I know where it's at

So let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, baby, ooh, ooh
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime for the first time

There you were,
Beautiful
The promise of love was written on your face
You led me on
With untrue kisses
Oh, you held me captive in your false embrace
Quicker than I could bat an eye
Seems you were telling me goodbye
Just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Sweetness was only heartaches camouflaged
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
We used to meet in
Romantic places
Oh, you gave the illusion that your love was real Now all that's left
Are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel
And all our meetings you avoid

And so my world you have destroyed
Just a minute ago your love was here, oh baby
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear, yeah
The way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
Oh yeah, you only filled me with despair
By showin' love that wasn't there
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged, oh
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
Oh, yeah
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand, ooh
You lured me into something I should have dodged

Alright, is everybody ready
Alright now, here we go
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four

Let it be soon, don't hesitate
Make it now, don't wait
Open your heart and let my love come in
I want the moment to stop when I can fill your heart
With more love, and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
My love will be so solid
It would take a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down

This is no fiction
This is no act
This is real, it's a fact
I'll always belong only to you
Each day I'll be living to make sure
I'm giving you more love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
My love will be so solid
It would take a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down

As we grow older no need to fear
When you need me I'll be here
I'll be beside you every step of the way
A heart that's truthful and keeping you youthful
With more love, more joy
Than age or time can ever destroy
My love will be so solid
It would take a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, war it down, tear it down

Whether you are here or yonder, whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But baby I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said "Good-bye"
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know

Much better off is my life since you came
And your heart spoke my name
Bringing me so much joy
From a lonely boy your love is me

Much better off friends
And neighbors say so
Just you and I and they know
You were made for me
Everyone can see your love is me

Much better off
Four words to define now
Since you said your mine now
It's my day right now
Let me say right now
Your love is me

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl ooh)

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame 
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
Well I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

(Talkin' 'bout my girl my girl) I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout

My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on.
I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.

You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love
Never my love

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you (on you)

Never my love
Never my love

You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
With me (with me, with me)

Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you
Day and night, night and day, why is it so

That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Day and night, night and day

Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

Love's a puzzle, love's a puzzle
Confusing as can be
But work it out and you'll discover
The beauty of love's mystery

Oh, be my love
Come let the work begin
Be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Be my love
We'll fit the pieces in somehow

Jagged edges such as heartbreak
Can drive you out of your mind
They don't seem to fit
But, oh, don't you quit 'cause
They're part of love's design

Oh, be my love
Come let the work begin
Be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Be my love
We'll fit the pieces in somehow

Oh, be my love
Come let the work begin
Be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Be my love
We'll fit the pieces in come, now

Oh, be my love
Come let the work begin
Be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Be my love
We'll fit the pieces in, ooh

Ooh, baby
Oh
Uh-huh

Two hearts, two of a kind
Love at first sight, why do they say love is blind
Slow down, we don't have to move fast
Cause the love that is real is made to last

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

Oh...

We paint a picture walkin' down the street
Leaves are fallin', baby, so are we
Hand in hand, that's the way it should be
How could somethin' so easy make me feel so complete

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

Take it easy, ooh
I want o feel your every emotion
Shh... Don't talk
And we'll makin' love in slow motion
Oh... Slow motion, baby
Oh... Slow motion, baby

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

One heartbeat at a time (Slow motion, baby)
One heartbeat (Oh, slow motion, baby)
Sooner or later it'll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat

One heartbeat (Yeah)
One heartbeat (Oh, baby)
Sooner or later it'll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat

No sooner had you come into my sight
When I thought I had been struck by
A bolt of lightning
It wasn't in the forecast, from the weatherman
I told myself , you got to get yourself together man
What a vibration to my brain,it was
The thought to be with you was instantaneous
Something bout' you woman
The (?) you call it
If what I see is what I get
I'd like to touch it all
One time baby
Could be the start of from now on

I don't know how you
Do what you do to me
But I know the feeling
Is getting through to me

The feeling that I have
Become a slave to
When I'm with you or without you
I still crave you

I hope that in the very near future you'll
Tell me that the feeling is mutual
I want you baby so much
Get you by yourself,
Touch to touch

One time baby
Could be the start of from now on

We could be good
(don't you know)
We could be the best
(don't you know)
It's about time
(don't you know)
We put it to the test
(don't you know)

My only request is
One time, one time, one time

And maybe then we could make it happen
Again and again, again and again
Again and again, again and again

Whisper I still love you 
Until that day is here ooh I'm cryin'.
 
Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby

It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go
Oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
Oh, but our love is here
Our love is here
But our love is here to stay
To stay

Hmm
Point it out, point it out to me
Point it out, this I've got to see

You're the one that I'm crazy for
And every day it seems I love you more and more
Now if there's some reason why I shouldn't love you
The way that I do with a love that is true
So go on and
Point it out girl, point it out to me
Though I doubt, it could ever be
Love's a hallway with so many doors
Which one did I go through that made me yours?

I want to close it up and never again
Leave from within to go back where I've been
So come on and
Point it out, point it out to me
Lock it up throw away the key, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's where I want for you and me to go
A life of happiness is guaranteed
All that we need is love to succeed

So let me in
Point it out (point it out), point it out to you-hoo
Show your love yeah, girl like you never knew
Point it out, oh baby now point it out to me
Show your lovin'

Soft and warm, a quiet storm
Quiet as when flowers talk at break of dawn, break of dawn
A power source of tender force
Generatin', radiatin', turnin' me on, turnin' me on

Oh, you short circuit all my nerves
Promising electric pains
You touch me and suddenly there's rainbow rings

Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, oh
Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, oh blow, baby

Oh, when you sigh, we can ride
A butterfly caught up in a hurricane, hurricane
Lucky me, I'm glad I'm free
Suddenly I'm caught up in your summer rain

oh, shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons 
Let it pour and never stop

Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm blowing
Through my life, through my life, through my life
through my life, through my life

Blowin', blowin', blowin', blowin'
Ah, through my life

Kiss me softly
Let your lightenin' light my fire

Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, through my life

Through my life, through my life

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

When I became of age my mother called me to her side,
She said,"Son, you're growing up now pretty soon you'll take a bride.
And then she said, "Just because you've become a young man now,
There's still somethings that you don't understand now,
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now."

My mama told me, "You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around." (shop, shop around)

Ah, there's somethings that I want you to know now.
Just as sure as the winds gonna blow now
The women come and the women gonna go now
Before you tell em that you love em so now.

My mama told me, "You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around." (shop, shop around)

A-try to get yourself a bargain son.
Don't be sold on the very first one.
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen,
A-try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.
My mama told me, "You better shop around."

Ooh yeah, a-try to get yourself a bargain son.
Don't be sold on the very first one.
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen,
A-try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'.

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.
Make sure that her love is true now.
I hate to see you feelin' sad and blue now."

My mama told me, "You better shop around (shop, shop)
Don't let the first one get you
Oh no cause I don't want to see her with you
Before you let her hold you tight, ah yeah make sure shes alright
Before you let her take your hand my son
Understand my son, be a man my son I know you can I love you"

There is a pain inside my heart
You mean so much to me
Girl, I love you, girl, I love you so bad

And if you leave, my pain will go
But that's no good to me
Girl, I love you, yes, I love you so bad

Well, it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had

There was a pain but now you're here
And I don't fear a thing
Girl, I love you, yes, I love you so bad

And she said, "Boy, I love you
Boy, I love you so bad"

(I love)
Girl, I love you
(I love)
Girl, I love you so bad
(I love, I love)

Well, it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had

There was a pain but now you're near
And I don't fear a thing

(I love)
Girl, I love you
(I love)
Girl, I love you so bad
(I love, I love)

She said
(I love)
Boy, I love you
(I love)
Boy, I love you so bad

(I love)
Girl, I love you
(I love)
Girl, I love you

Speak low when you speak love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon.

I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near,
Tomorrow is here and always too soon,
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

We're late, darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon.

I wait, darling, I wait,
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon

I wait, darling, I wait,
Will you speak low to me,
Slow to me, oh please,
Just don't say no to me
Let it flow to me, slow to me
Soon, soon, soon,
Oh, soon, darling, speak low to me
Darling, speak slow to me, 
Oh, oh, oh!

Mmh, yeah
Special occasion
Like when you dress up in your tie and tails, yeah
Special occasion 
Ev'ry time and it never fails
To give me a thrill
That's fresh and new
Every time I'm kissin' you 
It's something that you do 
That makes ev'ry time I kiss you 
A real special occasion
Like one that calls for toast of champagne
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Special occasion 
Ev'ry time and it's hard to explain
How the same old touch 
From the same old hand
Can make me feel like a diff'rent man 
I just can't understand 
But all the time you touch me 
It's a real special occasion yeah, yeah
Special occasion, oh
Mmh, mmh, yeah
Ooh, beautiful music begins to play 
You are the sun 
Brighten up my day 
Why don't you stay 
'Cause ev'ry time I'm with you
It's a real special occasion 
Like when in school
You got your cap and gown yeah
And it's a real special occasion
And every time that you come around, baby

She's a very kinky girl, 
The kind you don't take home to mother; 
She will never let your spirits down, 
Once you get her off the street.
 
She likes the boys in the band, 
She says that I'm her all time fav'rite; 
When I make my move to her room, 
It's the right time;  she's never hard to please.
 
That girl is pretty wild now;
The girl's a super freak;
The kind of girl you read about 
In the new wave magazines.
That girl is pretty kinky;
The girl's a super freak;
I'd really like to taste her 
Ev'ry time we meet.
She's all right; she's all right;
That girl's all right with me yeah.
She's a super freak, super freak,
She's super freaky; super freak, super freak.
 
She's a very special girl,
From her head down to her toenails;
Yet she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends,
In a limousine.
 
Three's not a crowd to her, she said;
"Room 714, I'll be waiting."
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles;
It's such a freaky scene.
 
That girl is pretty wild now;
The girl's a super freak;
The kind of girl you read about 
In the new wave magazines.
That girl is pretty kinky;
The girl's a super freak;
I'd really like to taste her 
Ev'ry time we meet.
She's all right; she's all right;
That girl's all right with me yeah.
She's a super freak, super freak,
She's super freaky; super freak, super freak.
Temptations sing; oh, super freak,
Super freak, the girl's a super freak; oh.
 
She's a very kinky girl, 
The kind you don't take home to mother; 
She will never let your spirits down, 
Once you get her off the street.

This song is dedicated to some people, 
With whom I had the pleasure of living over half the years I've lived, 
'til now, when we come to our fork in the road.

And though our feet may travel a different path from now on, 
I want them to know how I feel about them, and that I wish them well.

Sweet harmony,
Go on and and blow on.
Stay in perfect tune,
With your own familiar song.

Make the world aware,
That you're still goin' strong.
Go on,
Spread your joy around the world.
Spread your joy around the world.

Sweet harmony,
Yeah, yeah.
Go on and blow on.

I believe in miracles,
If you can dream it,
It can be done.

And though a task was made for two,
It can be done well by one.
Go on,
Spread your joy around the world.
Spread your joy around the world.
Ew

Sweet harmony,
Spread your joy around the world.
Ew
Sweet harmony,
Go on,
Spread your joy around the world.
Sweet harmony,
Ew

Sweet harmony,
Go on and go.

You were the prelude for the song,
The village minstrels play.
Though most of them have come and gone,
You're still around today,
Go on,
Spread your joy around the world.

Harmony, huh!
Spread your joy around the world.
Keep on!
Sweet harmony,
Ew,
To every heart and soul,
You know the joy you bring,
When you do your thing.

Sweet harmony,
Yeah!

Don't stop now,
No

Sweet harmony,
I believe
Spread your joy around the world.
Sweet harmony

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea,
Just me for you and you for me, alone!
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us,
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear.
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me,
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear;
It won't be too late, dear, for me.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea,
Just me for you and you for me, alone!
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us,
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear.
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me,
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

Oh yeah yeah yeah
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there trying to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you
Now honey that's quite a different subject

But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really I'm sad, oh I'm sadder than sad
You're gone and I'm hurting so bad
Like a clown I appear to be glad (sad, sad, sad, sad)

Now they're some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown when there's no one around, uh
Oh yeah, baby 

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
And honey to shield my pride I try
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you
'Cause I had to go (why did you go), oh I need you so (I need you so)
Look I'm hurt and I want you to know (want you to know)
For others I put on a show (it's just a show)

Now they're some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown when there's no one around, uh
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my surface hid
Smiling in the crowd I try
But in my lonely room I cry
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around, oh yeah, baby
Now if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care
'Cause really I'm sad

That place, deep inside of you
That special place, you give me

That you say is mine exclusively
What you say is my private domain

You've made that so plain
That place deep inside of you
Where no other one is allowed

Cause it's mine,
All mine, all mine, all mine
Makes me feel so proud
What you say is my territory
Is there just for me

Ooohh
It's my paradise
Ohhhh
It's my comfort zone
Ooohh

It's so very nice
Knowing there's a part of you
That's mine alone

There's no place like that place
Deep inside of you
That's always ready for me

That's so full of love
And you let it flow free
It comes flowing down
Like warm summer rain

Before the feelings over
Here it comes again
Before the feelings over
Here it comes again

There's no place like that place
No place like that place
No place

Wanna tell you that
There's no place like that place
No, no, no, no place
No place like that place
Deep inside of you

What's it all about, this crazy love
How did our two worlds entwine
How do I fit in to your life
How did you get into mine
I belong to someone else we know

Back when first we met
Oh, we thought for fun
One night together might be nice
Oh... Oh... But fun turned into love for both of us
So now we pay forbidden lover's price

Oh, cause love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy)
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy) oh, oh

Nights when you're alone, you know that I
Laid with someone else beside me
Oh, but you love me still and I love you
You know I would no matter where I'd be

Hey, but love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy)
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
We got to pay some agony if we wanna have ecstasy (For the ecstasy), oh...

Hey, got to pay some agony
If we wanna have an ecstasy, yeah
And we need each other desperately, don't we baby
And I'll never from you be free, no, no
So you'll have to do the leavin' me, yeah
And you'll have to do the leavin' me, oh, baby
Cause I'm gonna pay the agony, yeah
Cause, oh, lovin' you is ecstasy, that's what it is
And I'm willin' to pay the price, oh
Cause I'll make it a sacrifice, oh, yes, I will
And I'll never, never, never, never, never, never, never be free
From agony

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,
Jack Frost nipping at your nose,
Yuletide songs being sung by a choir,
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way,
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.
And every mother's child will want to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
For kids from one to ninety-two,
Although it's been said many times, many ways,
Merry Christmas to you.
They know that Santa's on his way

You may not know how
To make words rhyme
Carry a tune or a clap on time now
You may have no knowledge of musical things
But deep down inside of me
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song
That my heart sings
You may not what
Quarter notes are
Or what I mean by Four to the Bar now
Such musical terms may be Greek to your ears
But deep down inside of me
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song
That my heart hears
Now it's a tender song
It's like a rhapsody, a symphony
This song I find in this heart of mine
And it's begging you
Let nothing keep us apart
Oh, my darling
Cause you put a song in my heart
Now this song that I find in my heart for you
Every lyric and line
I swear it's true
The number one song on my personal chart
Deep down inside of me
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song
That's in my heart
Deep down inside of me
You have created a symphony
You're the composer
You put a song in my heart
You're the composer
You put a song in my heart
You're the composer
You put a song in my heart

Now if there's a smile upon my face 
it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care 
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around

You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
And babe you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

Well you could of been

You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

Well you could of been

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

Well you could of been

You may dismiss me as unimportant.
A guy who's only in the corner of your eye.
Right now I know I'm just a?
I'm just an easy friend on whom you can depend.

But darling, there will come a day,
Oh, when you look at me, my baby, another way.
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you.
Oh.

Oh baby, oh baby.
Ew oh oh baby.
Yeah.

I only see you in little glimpses.
We work together in a world of?
I'm only dreamin' of champagne kisses.
You pass right by me, honey.

But girl, there will come a day, baby,
When you look at me, my baby, another way.
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you.
You, you

There will come a great big day, yeah,
When you look at me, my baby, another way.
There will come day, baby.
Look at me, look at me

There will come a time, baby,
When I'll be yours, you'll be mine, baby.

There will come

Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, "go slow, I fall behind"
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

You said, "go slow, I fall behind"
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Time after time

Break of day
Why you coming so fast
Go away
I don't want to have to leave her yet

Here we lay
And we want it to last
We'll take every extra second we can get

Have you ever been involved
Doing something
And you don't want it to stop
You hope it's never done

Like the old saying goes
Everybody knows
Time flies when you're having fun

Father time
Won't you slow down tonight
Mother Nature
Is taking her course

You know I'm feeling more than alright
And my lovin' baby
You're the loving source

Have you ever been involved
Doing something
And you don't want it to stop
You hope it's never done

Like the old saying goes
Everybody knows
Time flies when you're having fun

Tu do do do, tu do do do, tu do do do, tu do do do do do do
People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you (need you), need you (need you)
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
Oh, you'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace
Oh, the tracks of my tears

Oh, I need you (need you), need you (need you)
Hey yeah, outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you
Baby, take a good look at my face
Oh, you'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah, just look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, take a good look at my face
Yeah, you'll see my smile looks out of place
Ooh, look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace

Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

When I'm with my friends
And the man talk begins
And they brag about all the love they've known
I sit in the corner all alone
The best thing I can do is listen
The most I've done is just some kissin'

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But when the conversation turns around
Virgin man they always put him down
People say he must be "funny"
He ain't had a taste of honey

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

My gift of love has never been unwrapped
My well of love it still remains untapped (oh baby)

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man
Can you (really) love a virgin man (baby)

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But a man who is a man
Ain't supposed to be that way
No no no no no no

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love a virgin man
(Wonder what my friends would do if they only knew)
Can you love a virgin man
(I've been saving all my love for you, you)
Can you love a virgin man

They say making love's an art
In which each man should take part
By the time he reaches twenty one
Making love is something that he should have done
It ain't like I've never wanted to
But it's easier to think than it is to do

Can you (really) love a virgin man (baby)
Can you (really) love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

Oh, oh, woah, oh oh
I've got a lover way over there on the mountain side
And I know that's where I should be
Don't you know
I've got a lover way over there across the river wide
I can hear her calling to me
Oh, she's calling my name (calling my name)
So sweet so plain (calling my name) I can hear her saying
(Come to me, baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby) ah

They tell me that the river's too deep 
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't get across to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine
'Cause I can hear her saying
(Come to me baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna get to you
(Come to me baby)
No matter what I have to do
(Come to me baby)

Oh, they tell me that the river's too deep 
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't make it over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine
'Cause I can hear her saying
(Come to me baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby)
Oh, baby when I get there
I'm going nowhere
Oh, oh, 'cause the river ain't deep enough
Oh, nothing's deep enough to keep me from your side
Ah, ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

Last night we had an argument
Oh, oh, yes we did
Although baby, the things I said
I never meant

Girl, I'm so sorry
That I broke
Your tender heart
For we've come too far to end it now

You say you're satisfied
And we can leave things just like this
Oh, oh, baby, but what you don't realize is
Without your love I can't exist

So, please, oh, please
Have mercy on me
Can't you see
We've come much too far to end it now

We've come much too far to end it now
Ohh, baby now, I know, I know
There's much too there in store
Oh, yes it is oh, yes it is oh, yes it is

To ever think about ending this
Would be so very wrong
Oh, yes it is
Oh yes it is

We've had arguments before
But there's one thing you must know
That I think
We've come much too far to end it

Baby, don't ya know
I could never let you go
Baby, love you so gotta let ya know
We've come much too far to

Baby, come to me
Gotta make you see
We can make it last
Just like in the past
We've come much too far to end it

What once was a dream 
Will now become 
Two hearts 
Will now be one, hey 

We're gonna write the book on happiness 
Pages that time cannot erase 
Starting here and now, oh, oh
Starting here and now, ooh, oh, oh
From this time and place 

Oh, what a beautiful day 
To take a vow 
Pray that the things that we say 
Will last from now on 
I do take you for mine 

We're gonna lock our lives together now 
Unshakable, unbreakable embrace 
Starting here and now 
Starting here and now 
Starting here and now 
From this time and place 

Oh

What love has joined together 
Only love can put asunder 
And we are 
What love has joined together

What's so good about goodbye?
All it does is make-a you cry
Well, if leaving causes grieving
And depart can break you heart
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?
Since you said goodbye to me
All I've known is misery
Well, if everything goes wrong
And lovers say so long
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares?
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair?
Won't you please tell me why
You could say this is goodbye
Girl, when it makes me so sad then it's got to be bad
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?

Won't somebody tell me, now
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares?
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair?
Won't you please tell me why
You would have the nerve to say this is goodbye
Girl, when it makes me so sad then it's got to be bad
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?
Baby
What's so good about goodbye?

Whatcha gonna do
With those beautiful fingers
When you stroke me like that
I get a thrill that lingers
Even after you take
Your hands away

The feel of your touch
Seems to stay and stay
Feels like the touch of love to me baby
The look in your eyes
Makes me wonder what you have in mind

I'm really anxious to find out
Whatcha gonna do, to me, with you

Whatcha gonna do
With those beautiful lips
Just watching you talk sometimes
Sends me on trips
I'm looking right at you,
But I don't hear what your sayin'
Cause I'm mesmorized by you're beautiful mouth
And my mind is strayin'

Sounds like you're talking love
(sounds like you're talking love)
To me baby (to me baby)
No matter what you might be talking about

I can't wait to find out
Whatcha gonna do, to me, with you

All you need is
What you got and
You got so many assets
That make my blood run hot
To me you're as good as it gets

Hey hey baby baby

Whatcha gonna do
With a body so fine
Will you hold it against me
If I say I want you for mine

Feels like you wanna be with me baby
Got me anticipating and waiting for whats in store

Don't make me wait anymore
(don't make me wait anymore)

Do what you wanna
Do what you feel
(do what you feel)
Do anything baby

As long as it's real

Do it

Ooh, yeah
I can't explain the things you do to me
But I'm sure there's an explanation or
Maybe it's the way that you carry yourself
Or maybe it's your conversation
Ooh, you've got me tiptoein' on a cloud
I pray that I might fall through
And hit rock bottom, soon to be forgotten
Like so many other people do

I need you to help me convince myself (oh oh oh, I love you) 
That besides me there's no one else (oh oh oh, I love you) 

'Cause I, (I feel) I feel a whole lotta shakin' in my heart (in my heart) since I met you, girl
Don't you know I, feel a whole lotta shakin' in my heart (in my heart) since I met you?

The guys I used to run around with
Tell me I've changed, that I'm acting kinda strange
But they don't realize that since I met you
My whole life has been rearranged
Ooh, you make me feel kinda insecure
'Cause my heart, I can no longer control
And you've got me knockin', jumpin' and stoppin'
Don't know which way I'm supposed to go

My heart is all tied up in knots (oh oh oh, I love you) 
I walk around daily in a state of shock (oh oh oh, I love you) 

'Cause I (whole lotta feelin' of lovin' in my heart since I met you, girl)
Don't you know I got a feelin' (there's a whole lotta feelin' of love in my heart since I met you?)

Whole lotta feelin' of love in my heart since I met you, girl
There's a whole lotta shakin' goin' on in my heart since I met you

Now my heart is all tied up in knots (oh oh oh, I love you) 
I walk around daily in a state of shock (oh oh oh, I love you) 

'Cause I (whole lotta feelin' of lovin' in my heart since I met you, girl)
There's a whole lotta shakin' goin' on in my heart since I met you, you, you
(You know what?) a whole shakin' goin' on (shake me up, yeah) in my heart since I met you, girl  
(Yeah, you makin' me shiver, ooh, you makin' me shiver) There's a whole lotta shakin' goin' on
In my heart since I met

Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow

Ooh  
Yesterday we made future plans 
She loved me I could tell 
Can today be that tomorrow that we planned so well? 

Yester baby I'll never forget her 
Though tomorrow might bring me one better 
Today I go on my way to love my yester love 
Today I go on my way to love my yester love, oh oh 

Yesterday I felt a tender kiss upon my face 
Now the day is gone and there's a teardrop in its place 
Oh, yester kisses that I used to treasure 
Now you're given some other lips pleasure 

Today I'm on my way dreamin' of my yester love 
Today I'll go on my way dreamin' of my yester love, oh 

Yester is, the prefix that we fix to things that have gone by 
Forever they seem, yeah even though my yester love 
Has slipped through my fingers, I find it still lingers 
In my heart today 

Yesterday I thought I had a love to call my own 
No one could have told me that today I'd be alone 
Yes the sweetness today has gone sour 
Seemin' further away with each hour 
Today I go on my way dreamin' of my yester love 
Today I go on my way dreamin' of my yester love 
Today I go on my way dreamin' of my yester love

Even mountains will crumble
Rivers will dry, stars will fall
And kings will be humbled
The weakest of men will be standing tall

Time changes, rearranges
Mountains and kings, everything
But you are forever
Baby, you are my night and day
You are forever
Darling I cannot remember when
I didn't love you

Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow will come and fade away
But my love is eternal
I promise you it will always stay
Time changes, rearranges
Things come and go
But one thing I know is
You are forever
Baby, you are my now and then
You are forever
And darling I cannot remember when
I didn't want you, need you, love you
Yeahess, love you, ah love you, love you, love you

Time changes, rearranges
Mountains and kings, everything
But you are forever
Baby, you are my now and then
You are my forever
I cannot remember when
I didn't love you

You're forever and ever
Baby, baby, ever ever, and ever
I, I cannot remember when
I didn't love you
Oh, love you, oh, love you love you
Can't remember when I didn't love you
Love you, love you, love you, hey yeah
Love you, oh, love you

You're like a baby, I'm like a set of blocks you got for a toy 
First you build me up and that gives you joy 
Then you change your mind and you start to destroy me 
Piece by piece I'm torn apart 
And all my dreams of being yours are crumbed to the ground 

Oh you only build me up baby, baby 
You only build me up baby, baby 
You only build me up to tear me down, down, down (ooh)

Oh on Monday maybe you might make me feel like I am a king (you build me up)
Tell me you're a puppet (you build me up) and I've got the string (you build me up)
Oh but then on Tuesday (you build me up) it's a different thing 
(Ooh) just as I begin to get the feel of the throne and (ooh) start to cherish the crown 
I found out you only build me up baby, baby
(Only build me up) baby, baby, baby, baby
You only build me up to tear me down, down, down (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Yeah, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh you give me hope, for a while you had me walkin' 'round on a cloud
Braggin' about you and feelin' real proud
Then without a warnin' in front of a crowd 
You bring me back to Earth with some unkind deed soon as I am heaven bound
Oh you only build me up, only build me up
You only build me up, only build me up
Baby, baby (only build me up)
Baby, baby, baby (baby baby), you only build me up to tear me down, down, down
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) yeah, yeah
(Only build me up baby, baby) baby, baby
(Only build me up baby, baby) ooh yeah, baby 
You only build me up to tear me down, down, down
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) yeah, ooh wee baby
(Only build me up baby, baby) baby, baby, baby
(Only build me up baby, baby) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah baby

I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Though oh, oh, oh,
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you,
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and, all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter, tighter

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend 
Another day here
Though Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, squeeze me, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
I've said you've really got a hold on me
You know you've really got a hold on me

Ooh ooh
Now you say every time you need some affection
The one you love goes in another direction
And you just sit there in a daze reminiscing
When you know some other lips he's been kissing

Now when you need the love 
He's never shown you 
Come round here 
And when you need some loving arms 
To hold you 
Come round here 
Now I may not be the one you want 
Oh but I know I'm the one you need 
Said I may not be the one you want 
Ooh, but I know I'm the one you need

Your life stands still the minute he goes
You count the hours just hoping he shows
Girl can't you see while you're longing for his touch
That I'm the one who loves you so much
While you're longing for his embrace
You're all alone there with tears on your face

Now when you feel the need to cry to someone cry to me
And when you feel the need to lean on someone lean on me
Now I may not be the one you want but 
I'm sure 'nough the one you need 
Oh baby I may not be the one you want 
Ooh, but I know I'm the one you need

Now the days the days you sit alone by yourself
He's out fooling 'round with somebody else
Leaving you alone here with nothing to do
Just waiting 'till he has time for you

Now when the loneliness 
Gets hard to bear 
Girl come round here 
And when you need a little tender loving care 
Girl come round here 
Now I may not be the one you want, ooh 
But I know I'm the one you need, ooh

Honey you do me wrong but still i'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and i can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more

I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me

It's a dog gone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true

Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

Are you still here
Are you still haunting me
Are you still wanting me to want you
Although you have gone

Are you still here
I don't know what to do for this
I thought I traded you for Mr. Blues
But you keep hangin' on

I thought you had gone for good
I thought I could make it
Even though I thought I could
I cant take it

You're like a chain, my love
And I cant seem to break it
You're like a chain, my love
And I cant seem to break it

Yes, you're still here
How can you be here when you're there
I feel your presence everywhere
Although you have gone
You keep hangin' on
Although you have gone

Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain
Let him walk on out if he wants to
He really doesn't deserve you
His loss is our gain so don't be blue

Cause stone blind and out of his mind
Is what he has to be, yeah
So baby straighten up, come on and fly right
It's no catastrophe, yeah
And say now baby, baby don't cry

Baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby here's why
Love is here standing by
Love is here standing by

Too bad it was him that you trusted
Too bad but you can't be disgusted
It's time that you got readjusted
And realized that tear filled eyes
Can't stop him now
That man is on his way
I think he's gone to stay
You better drop him now, yeah

Oowee now, baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby here's why
Because love is here standing by
Love is here standing by
You trusted him and gave him your love
A love he proved unworthy of
Oh baby, oh baby all you've got to do
Is dry your eyes long enough to see

That you have found the love you thought
You had in him here in me
Love is hope girl, love is strength
Here's someone standing right beside you
Who would go to any length

To give you love true and deep
And hope you realize at last
You found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep
So standing by you , tears aren't shed in vain
I said so

Turn the lights down low, baby come close 
Put your hand in mine, oh please be kind 
Let me touch your heart, let the fire start 
Oh so warm, so warm 

Soft music plays, please sit down & stay 
Put your trust in me, let this love be 
This is for real, let time stand still 
Oh so warm, so warm 

Turn the lights down low, baby come close 
Oh so warm, so warm 
So warm, so warm 

Oh turn the lights down low, baby come close 
Let dreams come true for me & you 
We won't regret, we won't forget 

Oh so warm, so warm, yeah yeah 
So warm, so warm 
so warm 
Turn the lights down low, baby come close

[Repeats till fade]
Oh so warm

Put a song in your heart, so you say
Sing it out, let the world know what its all about
If I make it possible for the impossible to happen for like you say

[Chorus]
Oh, baby thats backatcha
Baby thats the same thing you do for me
Baby thats backatcha
Oh baby thats tit for tat
I'm giving you this for that

You're flying high with your head in the clouds
Trouble comes along to bust your bubble
Its not incredible that I make regrettable
Things seem much better for you

[Chorus: x2]

[x3]
Baby thats backatcha

Time to move and start to jam
What it is exactly
You don't know what it is
So when you feel it don't try to conceal it
Just let it happen for you

[Chorus]

[x8]
Baby thats backatcha

Nothing so blue as a heart in pain,
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain.
 
Let him walk on out if he wants to, 
he really doesn't deserve you.
His loss is our gain so don't be blue 
'cause stone blind and out of his mind 
is what he has to be. Yeah!
So baby, straighten up, come on and fly right, 
it's no catastrophe.
Yeah!  And say now 
 
Baby, Baby, Don't Cry,  Baby, Baby, Don't cry, 
Baby, baby, here's why,
Love is here standing by, 
Love is here standing by.
 
You trusted him and gave him your love,
A love he proved unworthy of.
 
To bad it was him that you trusted, 
too bad but you can't be disgusted.
It's time that you got readjusted 
and realized that tear filled eyes can never stop him now.
Yeah!  That man is on his way 
I think he's gone to stay, you'd better drop him now.Yeah!
 
Oo wee now 
Baby, Baby, Don't Cry,  Baby, Baby, Don't cry, 
Baby, baby, here's why,
Love is here standing by, 
Love is here standing by.
 
All you've gotta do is dry your eyes long enough to see,
that you have got the love you thought you had in him,
Here in me, love is hope, girl, love is strength.
Here's someone standin' right beside you who would go to any length 
to give you love, true and deep,
And hope you realize at last you've found a love that you can keep, 
and only losers weep.
 
So, Baby, Baby, Don't Cry,  Baby, Baby, Don't cry, 
Baby, baby, here's why,
Love is here standing by,

She's not a bad girl
Because she made me see
How love could be

But she's a bad girl
Because she wants to be free
She wants to be free

She's not a bad girl to look at
Finer than fine
Said she was mine, mine, mine

But she's a bad girl
Because it was only a lie
I, I, I beg to the birds about [Incomprehensible]

It brought me out to find out
She was bad and my only wish is that
I wish I could make a bad girl to be good

She wasn't a bad girl, girl at first
So good at the start
But now, now we must part

Oh yes, she's bad girl
Because she's breaking my heart
So, so, so bad, she's breaking my heart

I don't care what they think about me, and
I don't care what they say.
I don't care what they think if you're leaving,
I'm gonna beg you to stay.

I don't care if they start to avoid me,
I don't care what they do.
I don't care about anything else but being with you, being with you.

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene,
Be out of the picture, and off of the screen.
Don't let them say we told you so,
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go.
I heard the warning voice from friends and my relations,
They tell me all about your heartbreak reputation.

I don't care what they think about me, and
I don't care what they say.
I don't care what they think if you're leaving,
I'm gonna beg you to stay.

I don't care if they start to avoid me,
I don't care what they do.
I don't care about anything else but being with you, being with you.

People can change, they always do,
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be that like love I am blind,
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?
One thing I know for sure is really, really real,
I never felt before the way you make me feel.

I don't care what they think about me, and
I don't care what they say.
I don't care what they think if you're leaving,
I'm gonna beg you to stay.

I don't care if they start to avoid me;
I don't care what they do.
I don't care about anything else but being with you, being with you.

We had our chance
Lord knows how we tried
To keep our love alive
To keep it strong
So if i hurt you girl
Try and understand
You can't go on pretending
When we know it's ending

Blame it on love
On the memories that linger in the night
Love never showed us how to make it right
So baby
Blame it on love tonight

We had our time
It went by so fast
We tried to make it last
To make it right

We gave it all we had
Girl don't look so sad
Let's go out remembering a happier ending

Blame it on love
On the memories that linger in the night
Love never showed us how to make it right
So baby (so baby)
Blame it on love tonight

There ain't no use in harping on
Girl it's time to let it be
We did all we could
And it won't do no good
To blame it on you and me

Blame it on love
On the dreams we shared that won't come true
On the feeling that our love would always see us through

So baby, (so baby) let's blame it on love tonight

We can blame it on love
On the dreams we shared that won't come true
On the feeling that our love would always see us through

Let's go

[Chorus:]
Ooo hey, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can
Ooo yeah, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can

What kind of fuckery has been required lately
It seems like these MC's heads need deflating
And I'ma play the pin cause I've been waiting
Now make my mark on pop culture from my generation
80s babies from the age of Nintendo
Transformers, Ninja Turtles, Hungry Hippos
GI Joes, Phot, can't forget the clothes
Kangaroos with the zipper had a couple those
Breaking into heavy spinning on my elbows
Couldn't get me out my _______
R.I.P ________
_______You know I miss you more then Shaq miss free-throws, that's alot
You put it back in the air, when the wee's (whistle) gone
Reminiscing bout when we were young, but now we've grown

Ooo hey, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can
Ooo yeah, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can

Comon ya'll
Lets talk about the scene for a minute
I know we ain't been seen in a minute
We left it for a minute now we all up in it
Baby boy if you've got them big dreams go and get it
Never been the type with tight jeans, I wont fit it
When I see those scene girls, bet they all gonna get it
And I'm living clean
Now a lot of ya'll won't get it
Now it's mean but I don't give a damn if ya'll don't get it
So fresh and so clean in my new jean
While I'm laughing at the bacon, you're all crying a the clinic
I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I've got my own to whirl, gotta live with it
Never played basketball, but I could show you how to dribble
Make your moves in that black hatch back Honda Civic
Like I did in high school, wishin' I could relive it
But I can't so let's go on, give the hook a revisit

Ooo hey, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can
Ooo yeah, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can

Maybe I'm wrong
But after twenty six years I feel I've payed my dues
So when you play this song
Just know that I live my life the way I choose
And now I stand here proudly in L.A.
At a sold out crowd
And when no one's around
I refuse, to be as inferior to you

Ooo hey, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam,
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can
Ooo yeah, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can
Ooo yeah, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can oh yeah, well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and back again
From Japan and Amsterdam,
With a ticket in my hand, singing
Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can

Ooooo hey
Ha ha ha
Yeahhh
Ha ha ha

Beggars can't be choicey I know
That's what the people say.
But though my heart is begging for love
I've turned some love away.

Maybe one was true love I'll never know which cause
your love is the only love to make this beggar rich.
I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.

People say you can't have your cake
and then eat it too.
They tell me I've been making a mistake
waiting around for you.
Oh, I'm begging for love and
why can't they see that yours is the only love for me

I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.

If beg you I must then I'll never give up cause
your love is the only love to fill this beggars cup.

I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.

I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.

If you took your heart

Till the end of time

Ooh yeah, doggone right
Doggone right

You brighten up baby
Each and every day that I have to face
And if the sun don't shine
Your smile is there to take its place

Smooth and warm tender touch
Letting me know that it means so much
To be loved by somebody who
Is just as much in love as you

Oh yeah, doggone right

Doggone right

Oh, you're doggone right now

You take the time to be concerned
It makes a man feel so good
To know that his love is being returned

Eenie meenie miny moe
Love is a guessing game I know
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
But I've got to win 'cause it's you that I choose

I choose
Doggone right
Doggone right
Said you're doggone right, oh baby
Doggone right, doggone right

If you think I'm gonna stay
Let nobody take my love away
And your doggone right

I waited 'til I saw the sun
Don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
Don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind
Forever

I would cross the angry sea
Die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind
Forever

Something has to make you run
Don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
Don't know why I didn't come
Don't know why I didn't come
Don't know why I didn't come
Don't know why I didn't come

Come to me soon as you can my love
Come to me now
Come to me soon as you can my love
Come to me now

I am on fire and what I require
Only you can fulfill my request
I have felt good and I have felt better
But you make me feel the best

Come to me soon
'Cause you know you're the one
Who can right up my life
Yes you're the midnight moon
And the morning sun
And you light up my life

You got a soothing moving tender touch
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much

I've some to find
For my peace of mind
Your presence is mandatory
You've got a few little things that you do 
That nobody else can do for me

Come to me soon
And we'll both have it made
Our love will be stronger
Yes you'll break my balloon
And rain on my parade
If you're gone much longer

You got a soothing moving tender touch 
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much
Come to me soon
Baby, baby come to me now
Come to me soon
Come to me now

Well you got a soothing moving tender touch
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much
Come to me soon
Come to me now
Come to me soon
Come and be with me
Come to me now

Oh my darling
Where are you tonight
Our situation wasn't really wrong
But it was not quite right
It hurts so much to say goodbye 
Still I'm so glad we met
Cause you're easy to love
Hard to forget

I really miss you 
But then I knew I would
We had some ruff edges that needed smoothing
But the good times were really good

Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love 
For one command I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love 

What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me
Although she has another, I can't have another for I'm not free 

She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love 

What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me
Although she has another, I can't have another for I'm not free

My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love

Problems with your man today

You know I, this is James Brown
I'm such a lover of people
Because people did so much for me
I'm a lover of all humanity, all man kind
And I feel that he who has been successful
Should look out of for his fellow man, his brother
I feel that's my role, that's my job
I know when I was a kid
You see I was gonna be a preacher, huh, ay
Maybe I am, but to me, I feel like I'm a teacher, somewhat
'Cause I've been able to experience things that most, poor
Or a lot of people haven't been able to, even the rich
So I'll start by preaching right here
'Cause I want to preach to you one more time about heroin
I talked once before, now I want to preach
I want to start by saying
I heared heroin talking one more time and said
From where I came, nobody knows
I come from a land where the poppy seed grows
A whole nation gathered to plot my destruction
Because I'm a breeder of crime and wholesale corruption
You say, I'm pure and then undiluatable
And once I'm in your blood I make it pursuitable
Now only they say sing it on son
Sing it on son, she says I've lost my son, he's gone away
Sing it on son, you might save a life
I said madam, I say lookie here
I say, on a record and make all men
That date to use it will wallow in sin
Driven then to commit a world of crime
Captive their will and destroy their mind
They changed their lives and destroyed the meek
Misurer of fools and made the strong men weak
I know, wait a minute, lookie here
They take gold from the rich and made them poor
Take young foolish maden and made her a whore
Look at that
And then I heared about that time
I heard a man over in the corner
He was sitting down with his head hanging low
I noticed him when he first walked in
And he was addicted to drugs but he said I feel it
And brother I want to get up and testify
So everybody started screaming and hollering and crying
I saw a little tear coming from my eye 'cause I know I felt it
And this brother got up and said let me have it
I want to tell you everything
Talk to a man that knows
He said some will sell me and some will buy
For a state of affection and they 'cause high
But regardless of the position, reason of use
You control my addition and I give nothing but abuse
He said let me tell you about heroin
With a full cause of torment
For it's pleasures and pain
It will take all of your money and poison your brain
Lord, I started singing, I said mmmm
The place started rocking to kinda rocking a little bit
I heard someone tapping their foot and they sing on brother
I started humming a little in the back ground
And then that brother said wait a minute
He said, beware of the sharp needle brother, it'll make you sick
Annoyed, anguished, and won't let you kick
It'll make you hustle, steal, borrow and beg
I'm still talking about that bad thing, king heroin
When you want to look for a vein in your arm or your leg
I felt so bad I didn't know what to do
He said, more priceless than diamond, more treasured than gold
More important than whiskey more deadly than wine
It'll just give you discomfort and no piece of mind
And when you come out the nod, he said you'll always be aware
You've shot every drop of your heart and it's full of fear
Now you must rush out and hit another sting
Praise me as old heroin, the king
But he said be quick my friend get off your knees

Ahhooww
Hey

C'mon now, I need that money

With her hands on her hips, oh, and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me
With her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream, I wish she'd just leave me alone
Because French cream won't soften them boots and French kisses will not break that heart of stone
With her long hair falling and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
Whoa-oh, she's the one
She's the one

That thunder in your heart at night when you're kneeling in the dark, 
it say's you're never gonna leave her
But there's this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies
and all you want to do is believe her
And tonight you'll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through
Oh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you,
she's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run
Whoa-oh, she's the one
She's the one

Oh oh, and just one kiss, she's fill them long summer nights with her tenderness
That secret pact you made, back when her love could save you from the bitterness
Oh, she's the one
Oh, she's the one
Oh, she's the one
Oh, she's the one

So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in!!

CHORUS:

Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you've been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Since you've been gone

So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

CHORUS

If you will come back
Baby you know
You'll never do wrong

CHORUS x 2

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

There's a storm outside, and the gap between crack and thunder 
Crack and thunder, is closing in, is closing in
The rain floods gutters, and makes a great sound on the concrete
On a flat roof, there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain 
Aerial held high, calling "come on thunder, come on thunder"

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul 

It's a monsoon, and the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys, stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are turning into something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore 

The boy is hit, lit up against the sky, like a sign, like a neon sign
And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on 

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul 

There's four new colors in the rainbow
An old man's taking Polaroids
But all he captures is endless rain, endless rain 
He says listen, takes my head and puts my ear to his
And I swear I can hear the sea 

Sometimes, when I look in your eyes I can see your soul
(I can touch your soul )
(I can reach your soul)
Sometimes

Huh!
Know we need it (soul power)
We got to have it (soul power)
Know we want it (soul power) 
Got to have it (soul power)

Give it to me (soul power)
Hey, you need it (soul power)
Huh, we want it (soul power)
Got to have it (soul power)

Under your skin
If I get there
I've got to win

You need some soul
Come on and get some
And then you'll know
Where I'm coming from

Huh, a man
A man, they come and go along
But I'm still on the case
And my rap is strong

Huh, ha, hey!

And a little special love, my little soulful girl

Gotta get ready, bring the New Year in

Merry Christmas and a happy New Year
All good cheer, there's one more thing
You've been so nice to me down through the years
And I'll always remember you, well, I'll never forget

You bought my records, come to see my show
That's why James Brown love you so
You come to see my show
That's a debt that I'll always owe

Come to see my show, see you at Christmas
Come to see my show, see my show

What goes up must come down
Spinning Wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles
It's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin
You got no money, you got no home
Spinning Wheel all alone

On the straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign?

And show you the colors that are real
Someone is waiting just for you

Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain

Oh, the dark days are done and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace

You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you

That's life, that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

I said that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine ol' world it keeps spinning around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a p*** and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself, flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life
I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a p*** and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life
That's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out
But my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shakin' come this here july
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die

There are four black horses
With eyes of flaming red
Their rovers are tied with ribbing
All around my baby's head 

The bells are ringing And their sail is going to sea 
Yes I know why they're ringing
They ring on for me
Oh yea 

I wish I could see my baby
This can't happen to me
No...

Baby please forgive me
I know I've caused you pain
I'll place your tears with diamonds
Just to see your face again 

(Repeat) 
Ashes into ashes
Dust to dust
Ashes into ashes

1 2 get down

Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
I paid the cost to be the boss

Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mutha
Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mutha

Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss

Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mutha

Told you so!
Told you so!

Havin' fun, got money to burn
Havin' fun, got money to burn
Havin' fun, got money to burn
Havin' fun, got money to burn

'Cause I paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss

Caught, tracked, turned my back
Caught, tracked, turned my back

Paid the cost to be the boss
I'm a bad mutha,
I'm a bad mutha

Head for the turn around
Headin' for the turn around
Told you so!

Paid the cost to be the boss

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!

It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

To run the game on me

Then dig it
From the real side
Stand, sure enough
To be satisfied

Get down

Let everybody know

My main squeeze
Just hit the town
Get up and do what, what you can
Get up and do what you can

For the world to see
Games don't mean
Nothing to me

You can't run a game on me
Don't need to thank me
Don't mean a thing
Hey, hit it, come on, uh

Playing in the car [?]
Wipe the sweat
Gonna have some fun
Time's getting short

We got to move
But in the meantime
Mama, we got to groove, hey

Long as you see
Can't run a game on me
Long as you see
Games don't mean a thing to me
Long as you see

Hey, hey

Where we all get down
Let everybody know
The main man just hit the town

Got a mean man
We got a mean man
I wanna see the man scream
I got the mean man

Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The "Ile de France" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom)

Hey y'all, John Coltrane yeah he plays the sax
Me, myself I love to max
Up in the studio laying tracks
Burn it on the CD, melt the wax
And now I'm feeling fine
Coz daily music's on my mind
And I feel mellow
When I watch the girl play the cello
Hello to all my fellow peers in here for the quality
Music quality, yeah
That'll be the focus in the top pick of the day
So pass the peas like we used to say
Pass the beats like they used to say
Pass the phunk like they used to say
That's my joint like we used to say
Syncopation the true school way

Ooh, la la aw wee wee
Nowadays music is all about fee
The soul is caged no bits now free
Unless the rhyme was rocked by me
I got the balls to bang (baw ba-ba-baw, ba-ba-baw, ba-baw bang)
Yeah, steady, just doing my thang (steady, just steady, just doing my own thang)
I just do it (ha!)
I just do it you know
My momma said to do what you know
So I'ma do what I know
James Brown gave me the fluid
That means a baby could do it
The Peas will do it so

Do it, do it, do it
Get up on the stage and release my fluid
Do my thing, do it through the music
Funkafied and therapeutic

I don't know what you came to do
I came to drop the funk on you
Depends on that sonic sound
But you know what?
They don't want music [x2]
They just want (a boom, boom, boom boom boom [x2])
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
They don't want music [x2]

Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger
Than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
try, cry
why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream
Dream

[Chorus]
What my baby needs now
Is a little more loving
What my baby needs now
Is a little more loving

One day, found myself
Feeling sad
But then I remembered
All the times that we had

Then I knew it
Wasn't what I was doing
I found out for myself
It was what I
Wasn't doing for you
And I said

[Chorus]

Some people laughing
They don't know what it's all about
And I, I promise myself
I, I, I won't lose out

[Chorus]

I love you, darling
I know it's true
And when the times get hard
I know you're gonna see me through

[Chorus]

Our love grows
Stronger day by day
And when people
Try to break us up
I say, ain't no way

[Chorus:Repeat x3]

Why did it happen this way?
Someone has taken my place
No one to share my embrace
Oh, why do you do me like you do?

I give my heart to you
Like no one else could do
I'm just-a lonely and blue
Oh, oh, why do you do me like you do?

Way down inside me
There is no one else but you, oh
Deep down inside me
There is no one else but you

I give my heart to you
And no one else could do

I'm just-a lonely and blue
Oh, why do you do me like you do

Way down inside me
There is no one else but you
Deep down inside me
There is no one else but you

I give my heart to you
But no one, no one else could do
I'm just-a lonely and blue, oh yeah
Why do you do me like you do?

Yeah, yeah

(I'm a woman)
I'm a man
(I'm a woman)
I'm a man

What makes a man break up inside?
And what makes a man give up his pride?
What makes a man feel he's began to fail?
And when he can't win he thinks he even can't tell me

(A woman)
Say it again
(A woman)
Say it again
(A woman)
I ask you

What makes a man jealous of each other?
So tacturned against his brother, now here's the reason
She makes a cloudy day seem bright
She makes a nightmare turn into the warmest night

You know, she makes trouble seem so, so
She can turn a hardship and she makes it so easy to cross
She brings life into the world over and over again
No man in the world could ever bear those pains

She never lets you know when se feels bad
And she smiles when she feels sad
And when you and when you feel blue
She know her place right beside you

Right beside you and I wanna know
What makes a man stop tiring?
And who's the only one
Can stop a baby from crying?

[Daz]
Motherfuckers know that it's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shoot out or fight
Niggas don't understand that it's on tonight
Hap hap hap it's on tonight.. Young Gotti!

[Kurupt]
Take preparation (preparation) meditation (meditation)
Convalescent solo solo psycho store storm and store propane
To roll the game rearrange change rain or snow
But for real explain the exceptional view
With the exception of an exceptional feud I view
Impose the arsonists to burn a bunch, extreme kerosene
Helium dioxide aquanated oxide acquitted lop side

[Chorus]
Baby this is it fuck da world
I'ma be the first nigga to fuck da world
Converse apparel inspired by..
Fly out the barrel five out the barrel

[Kurupt]
Just take position ammunition, convalescent Converse
Where we at first is where we at last, where we last cash
One last toke will make your smoke ride high
I'ma give everything like pushing the button
Now how does it feel when you die for nothing?
Metropolis crumble, apocalypse mo' lines surround and dine
Let loose in at least a Nam, calculate keep time
Finish the World War I've been a star
The knock quiminitar(?), strange and restrain
Retired and rewired, melodically molecules
Strategy and logic enables our positions then points us missiles
All sided equal... deeper than pistols
For instance... unknown the science of forensics
Get your backpacked like ten sticks
Hit like ten sticks hit with the effect of tense ticks inglow(?) sticks

[Chorus 2x]
[Kurupt] Baby this is it

[Daz]
It's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shootout or fight..
Boop boop hap hap, nigga it's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shootout or fight

[Kurupt]
Nigga you want war? Yeah right, I'm mic sky like stiletto
Holocaust to high school, roscoe to Vasco
Impossible lives the hospitalized
Franchise strip niggas is broke for ranches mansions avalanches
Alarms ring cause harm in court
Like platinum and gold
I've sold a whole, explosions hit explode implode
Popped out bodies dropped off on Rider's road
I've seen and foreseen the unseen
And able hardly able to separate the myths from fables
I'ma buy a Baltic while you purchase fireplaces
Poisonous supply and occupy in space
The midnight I could hide the dark until the spark
Light up the night nothing everything in sight
I'ma cross the finish line with both legs broken
Flow coke broken both toke smokin' (wha?)
Daz dilly machine dean two shottie
The life of a party is a live scene
Gastra.. neo kung-fu niastra
Monsoons swarm en route like harpoons
Young black Sinatra analytical ANTRA
A million percent proof bound to found the youth
Uncrude uncoil bubble and boil turmoil

To know of life
(To know of life)
Is to know what I'm living for
Touch my hand
And, baby, I'm yours

To know of love
(To know of love)
Is to know that I live for you
To be in love
Is to be there with you

(Everyday)
Everyday means so much to me
But it all depends on you
don't you know, oh, baby
We were meant to be
Oh, and life for me
Begins and ends with you

To know you're mine
(To know you're mine)
Is to know how it used to be
Yesterday is all I can see
that's how I know
Life can be beautiful
But it all depends on you
Now that you're gone, baby

(Since you've been gone)
Just not the same, baby
Since you've been gone
Just not the same, baby

To know of us
Is what I'm still living for
But it all depends on you
Baby, it all depends on you

(Baby, come home)
To know happiness
Is to know you're here in my arms
(Baby, come home)

Let me know, let me know, let me know
What it is to live again
(Baby, come home)
(Baby, come home)

I've an awfully funny feeling that this thought
That's been a-stealin' through my brain is not to be ignored
But to really tell the truth, though I'm not a well-known sleuth
I honestly believe that you are bored

You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses now are so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words "I love you"
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you ever cared

You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, yes, it's all over now
You've changed

Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come, no baby, the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

When tears come down, hey baby, like falling rain
Till now, you don't around and call my name
The way I think, you gotta walk the floor, way, way I do, baby
Your cheatin' heart, yeah, will tell on you, babe

When, when tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around, you call my name
You'll walk the floor baby, the way I do
Your cheatin' heart, will tell on you

The stars that shine
Are yours and mine
The rainbows in the sky
Are yours and mine

The song of springtime
The lullaby of Fall
The sunshine of summertime
Belong to us all

The moon above
Is yours and mine
The right to fall in love
Is yours and mine

The hope of finding the dream
Our hearts desire
All this is
Yours and mine

Fellas, I'm ready to get up and do my thing
I wanna get into it, man, you know
Like a, like a sex machine, man
Movin', doin' it, you know
Can I count it off? (Go ahead)

One, two, three, four

Get up, get on up
Get up, get on up
Stay on the scene like a sex machine

Wait a minute
Shake your arm; then use your form
Stay on the scene like a sex machine
You got to have the feeling sure as you're born
Get it together, right on, right on

Get up, get on up

I said the feeling you got to get
Give me the fever in a cold sweat
The way I like it is the way it is
I got mine and don't worry 'bout his

Get on up and then shake your money maker
Shake your money maker

Baby, give it up or turn it a loose
Baby, gives it up or turn it a loose
Starting over again
Baby, give it up or turn it a loose
Baby, give it up or turn it loose all right

Baby, give it up, turn it a loose
All night long, all right
All night long, ain't no use

Baby give it up turn it loose
Lord have mercy
Baby give it up turn it lose
Lord have mercy

Hold you tight
Cause I need you so
With all my might
I've got to squeeze you
Hold you tight
Because I love you so
Baby give it up all right

Wo! I feel good, I knew that I would now
I feel good, I knew that I would now
So good, so good, I got you

Wo! I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, I got you

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love won't do you no harm

And I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, I got you

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can't do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms

So good, so good, 'cause I got you
So good, so good, 'cause I got you
So good, so good, 'cause I got you

Hey! Oh yeah

A little dream castle with every dream gone
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay
Our beautiful garden has withered away
Where you planted roses, the weeds seem to say
A cottage for sale

From every single window
I see your face
But when I reach a window
There's an empty space

The key's in the mailbox, the same as before
But no one is waiting for me anymore
The end of our story is told on the door
A cottage for sale

From every single window
I see your face
But when I reach a window
There's an empty space

The key's in the mailbox, the same as before
But no one is waiting for me anymore
The end of our story is told on the door
A cottage for sale, for sale, a cottage for sale

Spread your wings for New Orleans
Kentucky bluebird, fly away

And take a message to Michael, message to Michael
He sings each night in some cafe
In his search to find wealth and fame
I hear Michael has gone and changed his name

It's a year since he was here
Kentucky bluebird, fly away

And take a message to Michael, message to Michael
Tell him I miss him more each day
As his train pulled out down the track
Michael promised he'd soon be coming back

Oh tell him how my heart just breaks in two
Since he journeyed far
And even though his dreams of fame fell through
To me he will always be a star

Spread your wings for New Orleans
Kentucky bluebird, fly away

And take a message to Michael, message to Michael
Ask him to start for home today
When you find him please let him know
Rich or poor, I will always love him so

Fly away, Kentucky bluebird
Fly away, Kentucky bluebird
Fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless they love you all the way
Happy to be near you
Oh, when someone cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless they need you all the way
Through the good years or the lean years
And all the in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us, baby
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all, all the way

Deeper than the deep blue sea
That's how deep it goes if it's real
When somebody needs you
It's no good unless they need you all the way
All, all, all the way, all the way, all the way

Talking 'bout me leaving America
You gotta be crazy, man, I like
All the nice thing, Jack
Colonial suits and things, look at here

Now I am sorry for the man
Who don't love this land
Now black and white, they may fight
But when up the enemy come
We'll get together and run about all side

I love it

The sun don't come out in rainy weather
But when you ball it down they are still together
Now let's not overlook the fact that we are, we are still in reach
You got to chance to make it and you got a freedom of speech

Say what you wanna, tell 'em how you feel
There may be a lot of places, a lot of places that you like to go
But believe me if you get an education you can blow
You can all it blow, dig this

Now you tell me if I'm wrong
America is still the best country
And that's without a doubt
America is still the best country
Without a doubt

And if anybody says it ain't, you can try to put him out
They ain't going nowhere, you got a good fight
When I tell you one time that I was a shoeshine boy
Every word I said, I meant

But name me any other country
You can start out as a shoeshine boy
And shake hand with the president
It ain't gonna help you gotta had that royal blood to make it
And I ain't got nothing royal but me
So I can take the chances, I'm gonna stay home

And look at here I got a brand new jet
When I need to move
I saw a brother made it
Now it ain't that a rule

So look at here
Brothers and sisters and friends, dig this
So quit your dreaming all night
Stop beatin' yourself and get up and fight

Don't give up, you might give up, but just don't give out
I know if you give out don't give up
There's no quick going, I mean like keep it moving you know
Cause if you stop like a ball quit rolling

Now we got two of the [Incomprehensible] from Florida to Rome
Which we know there's one thing we'll never forget
America's still our home, hit it bad
God bless America, I'm talking about me too
You know I'm American myself, I like that kind of thing, look at here

Live while you're livin', 'cause you know what they said,
Don't matter how long you live, you're a long time dead.

And I don't care what the people don't allow,

Dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha, dance, boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says,"Baby, uh, uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers though you don't care; you dance and shake the hurt
 
Dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha, dance, boogie wonderland
Sounds fly through the night; I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
"Boogie wonderland, wonderland"

Dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha, dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland

[Charlie Brown:]
Yo, I don't mean to brag, there's the tag
Brown got a brand new bag
Shining star up to par
Bars guitars
So far so good, gettin' greater at last
Where it counts, later for the last
First you're dead and stinkin'
Thinkin', winkin', drinkin', sinkin'
Ba-ba-ba-blinkin'
Baby paw, New York City is in the house
Without a doubt, we turn the mutha out
Routs threw out shouts, "Ain't we funky now"
Godfather, Soul Brother Number One

[Milo:]
Ugh! (Ugh!) Ugh! (Ugh!) Ugh!
I'm hot, huh! 
90 are levels of degrees burnin
Turnin' in a rough rotation
Livin' in the land of the lost and found
Can't drown in sounds of the James Brown, Brown, Brown
This is the mixture when you add hard texture
Can't get no harder, so I'm out to getcha
Its essence felt, you're turned inside out
Fellas, what you gon' say now?
Thirsty? Not, my verse just quenched your thirst
From the burst of energy
Shinin' on the appetite
Can't cross the thin line of the end of my time
(Hah!) Hold it, I'm still burnin'
Pop or not, I come to break up slots
'Cause it can't get no harder
Give it to me, Godfather

[James Brown:]
Can't get any harder, than what I got
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop
Can't get any harder, 'cause what I got
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop
Hey!

I've been around for a long time
Won't let nobody bring me down
Rock solid, solid as a rock
Too smooth to move and too hard to stop

[Busta Rhymes:]
Oh yes, come and get with this entourage
As we get busy in the garage
Leaders of the New forever large
'Cause we got the funk flip script, oh yes
Get up and ill, everybody move your hip, scream out "Yes!"
That's what I'm talkin about, ah!
Busta, Leaders come and turn it out
Don't try to front on the flavor
Save that for later
Or join the Maker in the spirit like an elevator
You want to know somethin' funny? I was devasted 
When I elaborated how we collaborated
With singers in music activated
Most necessary that we salute many too livin' legendary
James Brown comin to you, better open the door
Because I want to mop the floor!

[James Brown:]
Do it, ya
Gimme some rap, now hah
Put it there
Welcome to the club
Huh!
Bring it all together

Can't get any harder, ugh, than what I got 
(Soul!)
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop
Can't get any harder, ah, good God, than what I got 
(Soul!)
'Cause what I got, aaaaeeew, is sho' nuff hard to stop

I've been around for a long time
Won't let nobody bring me down
Rock solid, solid as a rock
Too smooth to move and too hard to stop
Can't get any harder
Ugh!
Agh!
Move-a
Aaaaaaooooh yes-a!

Aaaaaaaw!
The groove move ya

Can't get any harder, than what I got
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop
Can't get any harder, good God, than what I got
'Cause what I got is sho' nuff hard to stop

It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me

Happy together, unhappy together

But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

Take me to heart
And I'll always love you
And nobody
Can make me do wrong

Take me for granted
Leaving love unsure
Makes willpower weak
And temptation strong

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man

If you want to do right all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right all night man

Yeah, yeah, they say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together, baby
Show some respect for me

If you want to do right all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right all night man

A woman's only human
This you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man

If you want to do right all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right all night man
You've gotta be a do right all night man

Wait a minute, now
Who you say that was over there
Familiar looking cat
I know I seen him somewhere

Is that Maceo
He's doing everything over there
Maceo, is it who
Maceo, you know like
Maceo, won't you blow
Oh, yeah, Maceo

Now a good friend of mine
Sat with me and he cried
He told me a story
I know he ain't lying

Said he went for a job
And Mr. Man said
Without an education
You might as well be dead

Now don't get me wrong
He said, it's not who you are
But people come to me
From near and far

But I do just what
And I follow the rules
I didn't have an education
So I had to go back to school

Tell me one more time, people now
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

One more time
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

My friends told all his buddies
That he loved so well
And of their personal troubles
I will not tell

Now those guys didn't seem good
And they didn't seem bad
They didn't seem so happy
And I know they weren't sad

But the point isn't
That they follow the rules
They got an education
And they all been in school

Now underneath his tears
I could see the true fact
When he dropped out of school
He never, never went back

Tell me one more time, people
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

Got to, got to, got to listen now, now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

So one day he got tired
Of his little spending change
So he looked up his friends
To check their pay range

When he got there, the crib
He found that he was a drag
'Cause man, they were clean
And his clothes were like rags

One was a business man
With the plenty of dough
He had his thing so set up
You know he couldn't blow

The other had his job so uptight
He had his whole family
And his kids all out of sight

Tell me one more time now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to get a little learning
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

What made him so hurt
That these were his friends and he was a drag
They looked at him
And he was in the same old bag

For his friends they worked real hard
When the work day was through
Now, he realized
He should have done the same thing too

Tell me one more time now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to get a little learning now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

For the last time, I'm gonna say
They kept on pushing
When the going was tough
And now they know
That things don't seem so rough

So kids, stay in school
Don't be no drag
Take a fool's advise
And stay out of that bag

Look here, tell me, Bobby tell me one more time
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

Tell me, The Jewels, tell me now one more time
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

Everybody, tell me one more time
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to, got to get some learning now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

Don't be a drop-out, stay in school now listen to me
What do you say?
Kids, kids
Might as well be dead

No, no
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

Stay in school, have a good time
What do you say?
Don't, don't, don't ever blame
Don't ever blame, don't ever blame, come on

Feels so sweet

About to work me to death

Georgia, oh Georgia
No, no, no, no, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind

I said a Georgia, heh, maybe it's because
I'm from Augusta, Georgia
A song, a song of you
Comes so sweet and clear
Like the moonlight through the pines
Oh now

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you, yeah

Georgia, yea, Georgia
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind, sing the song

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes will smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you, oh, oh

Georgia, Georgia
Ahh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia, my hometown, on my mind
Oh Georgia

Don't guess why
Over what you're doing

Over what you're doing
If I keep loving you

Take care of business, sister, I'm your fella

Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger
Than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
try, cry
why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream
Dream

We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

May not know enough about you, babe
That can only come in time
Only know enough to make you stay
On my mind

Though I met you only yesterday
And only for a moment then
I knew I couldn't let you get away
I just can see you, girl

I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me

Can't say I can't live without you, babe
That's just some worn out loser's line
May not know enough about you, babe
But you stay on my mind

I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me

I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me

I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me

I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart

On just and ordinary day, no reason, no reason for a fuss

But even though, it isn't Christmas, let us love one another, let us love

On just a day, just a day, no special name, no pretty presents, pretty presents to exchange

Make it a good day, just the same

Let us love one another, let us love

No special greeting, special greeting for the day

No happy easter, no merry christmas, only how are you today

Make it a good day, anyway

Let us help one another, help your neighbor, he's your brother

Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us love, love one another

Help your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, now let us love

One another,

Help your neighbor, he might not feel so good sometimes, 

Let us love, love one another, help your neighbor,

Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us help, help one another

Love your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, let us love

Let us love, let us love, love one another, help your neighbor

He's your brother, let us love one another, let us love

Probably one of the nicest affections in the world
Is that feeling that's there between
A worldly old uncle and very innocent young niece

Liza, won't you lay your head on my shoulder?
Cry if you want to, I don't mind
Seems as if you need some love and kindness
And all I've got is time

Wiser is the way when you grow older
Nothing heals a broken heart but time
I know what it means to need a shoulder
So lay your head on mine

Wiser is the way when you grow older
Nothing heals a broken heart but time
I know what it means to need a shoulder
So lay your head on mine

I know what it means to need a shoulder
So lay your head on mine

Yeah, yeah, I know you wit' her and you all in love
What am I supposed to do, congratulate you?
Whatever...
How you in love wit her, when every thug hit her
Just met her off a lap dance now you babysit her
And get her everything she need
From pills to weed
Bite into the forbidden fruit like Adam and Eve
I can't believe you all in, when the snake bitch crawlin'
Watch her slither, body glitter
I know you did her, you was wit' her when she shed her skin
She gave you head again to make sure the venom sunk in
Poison, she fucked all your boys and brought the sex toys in
Vibrators, she said she was a dick hater
She didn't want you to fuck her, just masturbate her
Now you in love wit' the hoe

[Chorus:]
You in love wit' that hoe [11x]

Now this is some sick shit said
I'm smackin' bitches wit my dick head
And yellin' 'all tricks dead'
And if you paid for the pussy ain't nothin' wrong
To her you just anotha nigga pealin' off ya Sean Jones
This hoe love pullin' down jabodes
Behind closed doors, niggaz ready to bust those
But some niggaz be like 'I love you'
We like 'Fuck you dyke, suck a pussy too'
The bitch is raw, I mean yo bitch is raw
Sucked the milkshake straight out the straw
Flippin' up outta her drawers like Dominique Dawes
Now you runnin' round tellin' niggaz she all yours

[Chorus:]

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
How you love that hoe when you know what she is
Got five baby daddies and eight different kids
Her last man did a bid for some shit that stank bitch did
Now she pregnant wit' your kid so you wish you slid
Last week you said you loved her and you can't get ridda her
This week she gave you crabs and gave your ass Cymatia
Fuck you Ms. Jackson, I still don't pity ya
Bitches lie and suck dick after dick
And still some niggaz can't cope wit' it
And be like...
'I love you, I need you'
Fuck that!
'You my girl, you my girl, fuck whatchu niggaz say, man'
Fake ass niggaz! You punks, you niggaz should have pussies
Instead of dicks! And that's all you fake niggaz!

When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day

Make a smile for me
Lately I've been so lonely
And a smile from you
Might make these blues go away

Stay awhile with me
Can't you tell I've been lonely
And a smile from you
Might make it a nicer day

Close your eyes and dream of a sunny place
Watch the world light up when you smile
Stay with me and smile at me, sunny face
Chase the clouds away with your smile

Close your eyes and dream of a sunny place
Watch the world light up when you smile
Stay with me and smile at me, sunny face
Chase the clouds away with your smile

(Hmm, hum, hum)
Ah, she keeps me moanin', groanin'
Hey, because I feel so good, feel real good
Why can't nobody love me like my baby does?

Young girl turned out to be two times
Quite the woman that I thought she was
Oh she keeps me moanin', groanin'
Hey, because I feel is good. I feel real good

Oh, can't nobody do, no, no, no,
What my baby's done
Said, if she ain't the best in the world
She's good as the goodest one

And she keeps me moanin', groanin'
Hey, because I feel real good
I feel real good, oh, oh, eh, hey
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh, ho, oh, ho

When you appeared in my imagination
I had no idea that you'd ever be real
Now you're my life, not just some fascination
I love you now that you're here

Now that you are real not my imagination
But someone to love and I do love you dear
Long before love you were here in my memories
And I love you now that you're here

And now my dream talks to me
And fixes my coffee in the morning
And rubs my back when I'm weary
Thank you dear
And I love you now that you're here

Now my dream talks to me
Fixes my coffee in the morning
And rubs my back when I'm weary
Thank you dear
And I love you now that you're here

Now that you are real not in my imagination
But someone to love and I do love you dear
Long before love you were here in my memories
And I love you now that you're here
And I love you now that you're here

When I was a little boy back in West Virginia
We lived very close to a railroad track
And I remember I used to dream about them trains
And where they might go
And the people that worked on the trains

And the train made music, it made you feel good
I can remember sometimes
I could just stand off all by myself
And just get funky listenin' to the train

And I used to pick up a handful of gravels
And throw 'em down on the ground for ties
Yeah, and I'd make up songs, I'd sing

He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train

He rode across the plains
He rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
And wore bandannas made in old Japan

He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
And a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train

He used to change his name
To every place he came
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine

And a railroad man
No, he was a railroad man
And a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train

Used to change his name
To every place he came
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine

He rode across the plains
He rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
Wore bandannas made in old Japan

And he was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
Oh, a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train

Used to change his name
[Incomprehensible] to every place he came
His name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine

You know, he was a good time railroad man
Good time railroad man
Oh, a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train

It's alright
Say you know it's alright
If you've ever been downtown
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout

You know, he was a good time railroad, road
Good time railroad man
Oh, a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train

He used to change his name
To each and every place he came
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine

He rode across the plains
He rode, he rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
And wore bandannas made in old Japan

Oh, railroad man
Oh, railroad man
Oh, railroad man
Stepped in front of the railroad train

Staring at shadows on the wall
Wish I knew of someone I could call
Someone who might understand it all
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me

Someone's lying with me in my bed
Some stranger who don't understand my head
Wish it was you lying here instead
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me

Drowning in a sea of pretty faces
Being quite the man about the town
Packing up and going different places
But I show miss having you around

I listen to the noises down the hall
Think I'll move out of here in the fall
I ain't exactly having me a ball
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me

Yeah, no

She spends the daytime being a lady
But when the nighttime rolls around
She's got some games to play
She wants to get on down

Get down, down, get down, down
Get down, down, down, down, down

Don't fall in love, love, nothin' to say
Won't let your story get off the ground
Don't let your feelin's get in the way
She wants to get on down

Get down, down, get down, down
Get down, down, down, down, down

Never could stand to be tied to a lover too long
Hurry to play but plan before the day to be gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

Down, get down, down, get down
Down, get down
Down, get down, down, down, down, down

Don't fall in love, love, nothin' to say
Won't let your story get off the ground
Don't let your feelin's get in the way
She wants to get on down

San Francisco morning coming clear and cold
Don't know if I'm waking or I'm dreaming
Riding with Fats Waller on the Super Chief
He said, musics real, the rest is seeming

Oh, deep pain
Feeling that won't go away
There's the sound of his soul in the air
I can hear it up there
And I know he left those soul shadows
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind

Soul shadows on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Soul shadows on my mind
On my mind, on my mind

Standing by the window as a fog rolls in
I swear I can hear a far-off music
Jelly Roll is playing down in Storyville
And Satchmo is wailing in Chicago
You ought to heard 'em play
Feelings that won't go away
Left the sound of their souls in the air
I hear out there and I know

They left them soul shadows all on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
They left them soul shadows all on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
They left soul shadows on my mind
They left them shadows on my mind
They left them soul shadows on my mind

Who will buy a glad story
That a young man has to tell?
Come into my house of glory
And I will treat you well

Who will buy a sad story
That a widow has to tell?
Come into my house of lonely
And I will treat you well

Young and old, we all have stories
That we all must try to sell
Tales of how you get to heaven
And how we been through hell

Who will buy a perfumed story
That a young girl has to tell?
Sleep with me on satin pillows
And I will treat you well

Very superstitious, writing on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass 
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way 

Very superstitious, wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song 
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeh, yeh 

Very superstitious, nothin' more to say
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, no, no, no

In a room with soft satin pillows
Cracklin' fireplace keeps us warm
Whisprin' wind through weepin' willows
And sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms

In a soft light her eyes are gleamin'
Pretty little hand covers
Up her mouth when she yawns
Wake me up, I must be dreamin' that
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms

Sleepy kisses, warm me softly
Get much warmer later on
I reach for the light and turn it off
Uh, huh, sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms

Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms

You can fill up a room with idle conversation you can sit 
up a whole darn nation with your mouth 
but before you start to show you indignation 
about a situation you ought to take it all in and 
check it all out 
You can create a boom with catchy information 
you shake up a lot of people if you shout 
but before you begin to grin about the 
success of your creation, you ought to take it 
all in and check it all out. 
You can make out a plan with aimles 
dedication you can hang up a million slogans 
in you house 
But before you put it into operation before 
you man your station, you ought to take 
it all in and check it all out, and find out 
what it's all about.

Sweet and tender things
Are so much nicer than silly games
Softness makes it easier to smile

It's better to remember things
That makes the sun shine in your memory
There's clouds enough for you to see
Smile for me and take a look around

And you know that you're in love
When things are better than you thought they'd ever be
Won't you smile for me
I like what's going down

hmm

And you know that you're in love when things
Are better than you thought they'd ever be
Make a pretty smile for me (smile for me)
I like what's going down (since you've been around)

Sweet and tender things (Sweet and tender things)
Makes you feel better than playing games (better than playing games)
Softness (softness, softness)
Makes it easier to smile

You're in love when things
Are better than you thought they'd ever be
Smile for me
Sure you like what's going down (since you've been around)

A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you
You looked at the ground

I don't know who he is
But I think that you do
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you

Something in my heart and in your eye
Tells me he's not someone just passing by
And when you cleared your throat
Was that your cue
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you

Now when I add the sum of you and me
I get confused when I keep coming up with three
You're too much for one man
But not enough for two
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you

Well, you tell me men don't have much intuition
Is that what you really thinking girl
Or are you wishing
Before you wreck your old home
And search for another new

Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you

Lookin' at the pictures of the places 
That he'd been, an old man told me what he'd found
Said it don't make no difference whether you're
Out or whether you're in, though the world keeps
Goin' round and round.  Goin' round and round.

Said he looked at the places talked of the faces that he'd seen
Then he turned the pictures upside down.
Said it don't make no difference how many places you've been
Said the world keeps goin' round and round.
Goin' round and round

Then he put up the pictures shook his head, and with a grin,
He talked about his ups and downs
Said it don't make no difference how many fixes you've been in
No, the world keeps goin' round and round
Goin' round and round.

Betty Joe Johnson, don't you pull no Daisy Mae on me
Daisy Mae she did me dirty, so I had to leave her for 
Anna Lee.  Anna Lee she had big street feet.  
She spent her nights out on the row

So I started seeing Sally Jackson, I had to let Anna Lee go
Sally Jackson was a player
Had another man along with me
So I just took me one step backwards
Checked up on old Anna Lee
Anna Lee still had them street feet
Liked to dance all night and sleep all day
So I just took one more step backwards, 
checked up on old Daisy Mae
Daisy Mae was still doin' dirty, 
so I'll tell you what I had to do
Had to go just one step further Betty Joe Johnson 
Yeah, and that's how I know you

Looked at the places talked of the faces in life he'd seen
Then he turned the pictures upside down
Said it don't make no difference how many places that you've been
Said the world keeps goin' round and round
Goin' round and round

You just cant smile it away
Its much more than passion
Oh its love
And I've heard some people say
They've seen love move mountains
You just can't laugh it away
Its too deep inside
you feel it
Oh its love
Not just some game you can play
no laugh and then go on your way

Lets sit and talk it over
And work it out
I love you so
Can't we just talk it over
And see what we can do?

You just can't pass it away
Like some silly fashion, no its love
And love comes eager to stay
It just won't leave you that way
Lets sit and talk it over
and work it out
I love you so
can't we just talk it over
and see what we can do

Crazy hours, party nights
Lady power, hardly right
Oh! The showers cold and light
Hot! And lonely every night

Try to find a love
Holding on, wanting love
You try to find love
Keep on holding on
Just hanging out
Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night

I will be there
Every night
How you see me
Hardly right

A one and only would be nice
Hot and lonely every night

You try to find a love
Holding on, wanting love
You try to find love
Keep on holding on
Just hanging out
Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night

Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night

Sometimes I feel like
Not a single blues

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know,
Hey, I oughtta leave young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away

If you don't look into your mind and find out 
what you're running from 
tomorrow might just be another day to run 
If you just sit and waste your time you'll be 
going where you're coming from (think about that) 
tomorrow might be just another day to run 
Someone must control your mind 
you're the one 
dark confusion's what you find when you run. 
I don't want to waste your time but I'm talking 
to you like a son 
Tomorrow might be just another day to run 
Walking down the road of life looking for direction sometimes 
my mind gets so mixed up I can't tell lust from affection 
Gonna stop in to a roadside church and get my mind a rest 
and Lord Jesus, help me get my soul together in the process 
Pretty ladies stand in line waiting for inspection 
ragged old men drinking wine trying to drown rejection 
I've been wasting too much time, I'm going to lose my 
mind unless, Lord Jesus 
You help me get my soul together in the process 
I see Tony Jr. fill up his arm with dope and dream 
about a valley but he lives in an alley 
filled with papers thrown away -- Lord tell me 
He's long on dreams and short on hope and sometimes 
he goes to rallies and stops by to see Sally just 
to pass the time away 
Lord tell me Tony tell me why do you want to get high 
enough to die.

She couldn't stand me anymore 
so she just took the kids and went.
You see, I've got a drinkin' problem, 
all the money that we had I spent.

Now I must die by my own hand 
'cause I'm not man enough to live alone.
Hey, hey, she's better off without me 
and I'm better off dead now that she's gone.


Ah, she gave the most, took the least, 
she even had the priest come to our home.
And I cried and prayed and promised 
that I'd leave the stuff alone.

Now I must leave what I can't face, 
I hope she finds the kids a happy home.
Hey, hey she's better off without me 
and I'm better off dead now that she's gone.

She used to call her friend and cry, 
then the man cut off the telephone.
She'd sit and cry while I went out 
and pawned the things we owned.

Now I must die by my own hand 
'cause I'm not man enough to live alone.
Hey, hey she's better off without 
me and I'm better off dead.

Can We Pretend
Can we pretend 
That from now on 
There is no yesterday 
Paint a portrait of tomorrow 
With no colors from today

[Chorus]
There's a light that shine in your face sometimes 
That takes my feeling wraps them around your need 
But there's shadow hiding in your heart sometimes 
That makes my feelings turn back in on me

Can we pretend 
The pain is gone 
And go our merry way 
Paint a portrait of tomorrow 
With the colors bright and gay

[Chorus]

City of the angels spread your wings for me
I've been other places lookin for my dream
Eastern cities move to fast
Southern ones to slow
I can't go back to my past
And I need someplace to grow

City of the Angels 
Clear your cloudy skies for me
I heard you got some places that I oughta see
Heard you got a disneyland not too far away
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day

LA, LA, find a place for me
Gimme all your spaces please 
It's where I wanna be

City of the Angels spread your wings for me
I heard you got some places an old man like me should see
Heard 'bout your disneyland not too far away from town
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day

LA, LA, find a place for me
Gimme all your spaces please
It's where I wanna be

I heard you got a disneyland not to far away
And when it rains I understand the skies are clear all day

LA, LA, find a place for me
Gimme all your spaces please 
It's where I wanna be

Sugar lady, be my savior
'Cause I'm tired, I've been eight days on the road
That's right, eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night
There ain't no town, ain't no town, ain't no rest tonight

Broke and busted, standin' on the county line
I've been traveling eight days on the road
That's right, well, eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night
There ain't no town, ain't no town, ain't no rest tonight, oh

I'm out here thinkin', thinkin' 'bout what I've done
That's why, oh that's why, I'm eight days on the road
That's right, well eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night
I'm comin' home, I won't be long, I'll make Birmingham tonight

Oh sugar lady, be my savior
'Cause I'm broke, busted, I've been eight days on the road
Hitchhike, I've been eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night
There ain't no town, there ain't no town, there ain't no rest tonight

Comin' home, and I won't be long (Eight days on the road)
Sugar lady don't you do me no wrong (Eight days on the road)
Ridin' on the highway and I'm outta luck (Eight days on the road)
Mmm, ooh ooh

I'm makin' it back to you
Makin' it back to you
Makin' it back to you
Makin' it back to you
Eight days on the road
Eight days on the road

Eight days, well, woo!

One of us has to say he's sorry or we will never be freinds again

Let's have a drink and talk it over.  I want to keep you for my friend

We're here to day and gone tomorrow

None of us knows when life will end

I said some things that caused you sorrow

But I want to keep you for my friend


One of us has to say he's ssorry

We will never be friends again

Let's have a little drink and talk it over

I want to keep you for my friend

We're here today and gone tomorrow.

None of us knows when life will end

I said some nasty things that caused you sorrrow

But I want to keep you for my friend

When I wake up in the morning love 
And my heart is filled with pain
The smile I had upon my face is gone
Can't see the sunshine from the rain
When I think of you then the world is alright with me
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be
A lovely day lovely day

Jesus you're the lover of my soul
The fire that burns deep within
You are the joy this world can't take away
The spirit tells me this will never end
When I think of you then the world is alright with me
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be
A lovely day lovely day 

I know you going through some stuf now
Feeling ruff now, feel like givin' up now
But how can you learn if you don't fall
But how can you walk if first you don't crawl
But through it all you keep blessing me
While people keep on pressin' me and stressin' me
Because they never hear a preacher flow
Let's come together with one heart, one mind
Until we see the sunshine
When I think of you then the world is alright with me
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be
A lovely day lovely day 

A lovely day yeah

Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say, "Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
"Might be snakes there in that grass"
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her,
She'd say "Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus hands"
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say, "Matty don' you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple core"
But I don't have Grandma anymore

If I get to heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands

Looking out at the people looking in
Feeling good must be some kind of sin
Looking in at the people looking out
Feeling guilty, scared to move about

Looking up at the people looking down
Taking tranquilizers by the pound
Looking down at the people looking up
Getting mad 'cause they can't get enough

Ah, but that green grass on the other side
Is just an illusion
We all have our own confusion

Rich people watching the people poor
Trying to figure out how to get some more
Poor people watching people rich
You know, they call them dirty you-know-which

Ugly people watching the people pretty
Say they can't get down to the nitty-gritty
Pretty people watching people ugly
Say I sure couldn't stand you to kiss and hug me

Ah, but that green grass on the other side
Is just an illusion
We all have our own confusion

Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on
Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town
And everybody there tries to put my Sloopy down
Sloopy I don't care what your daddy do
'Cause you know Sloopy girl I'm in love with you
And so I'm singing

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sloopy let your hair down girl, let it run down on me
Sloopy let your hair down girl, let it run down on me

Come on Sloopy, come on, come on
Come on Sloopy, come on, come on
Well, come on Sloopy, come on, come on
Well, come on Sloopy, come on, come on

Well it feels so good, come on, come on
You know it feels so good, come on, come on

Well shake it, shake it, shake it Sloopy, come on, come on
Well shake it, shake it, shake it yeah
Yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Summer night in Harlem,
Man it's really hot!
Well it's too hot to sleep
And too hot to eat.
I don't care if I die or not!

Winter night in Harlem,
Oh oh radiator won't get hot,
And that mean ole landlord
He don't care if I freeze to death or not!

Saturday night in Harlem,
Ahh every thing's alright.
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing,
The parties are out of sight.

Sunday morning here in Harlem
Now every body's all dressed up.
The heathen folk just getting home from the party
And the good folk just got up.
Our crooked delegation
Wants a donation
To send the preacher to the holy land
Hey hey lord honey don't give your money
To that lying, cheating man..

Saturday night in Harlem,
Ahh every thing's alright.
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing,
The parties are out of sight.

There is only one love in your lifetime
There is only one lover can only do right
When they love you until the daylight
They put their heart on your life

There is only one love in your lifetime
Keeps on turning you on when you turn out the light
And they love you with all their might
They put their heart on your life

Put a little heart in your life oh
Put a little heart in your life
Put a little heart in your life
They put their heart in your life

Hold on! I'm in love and only love
What she can do tonight
Hold on! When the lover in your life
They put their heart in your life

There is only love in the nighttime
Keep on turning you on when you turn out the light
When they do unto you to do right
Put the heart on in your life

There is only one love in your lifetime
There is only one lover can only do right
When they love you until the daylight
They put their heart on your life

Put a little heart in your life oh
Put a little heart in your life
Put a little heart in your life
They put their heart in your life

A Hello like before
I'd never come here
If I'd known that you were here
I must admit though
That's it's nice to see you, dear
You look like you've been doing well

A Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again, that's kiss and tell

Hello like before
I guess it's different
'Cause we know each other now
I guess I've always known
We'd meet again somehow
So that it might as well be now

Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again, that's kiss and tell

Hello like before
I guess it's different
'Cause we know each other now
I guess I've always known
We'd meet again somehow
So that it might as well be now

Maybe the lateness of the hour
Makes me seem bluer than I am
But in my heart there is a shower,
I hope she'll be happier with him.
Maybe the darkness of the hour
Makes me seem lonelier than I am,
But over the darkness I have no power,
Hope she'll be happier with him.

I can't believe that she don't want to see me,
We lived and loved with each other so long.
I never thought that she really would leave me,
But she's gone.
Maybe the lateness of the hour
Makes me seem bluer than I am,
But in my heart there is a shower,
Hope she'll be happier with him.

I can't write left-handed. 
Would you please write a letter-write a letter to my mother?
Tell her to tell-tell her to tell the family lawyer.
Trying to get a deferment for my younger brother.
Tell the Rev. Harris to pray for me. Lord, lord, lord.
I aint gonna live-I don't believe I'm going to live to get much older.
Strange little man over here in Vietnam I aint never seen, bless
his heart, aint never done nothing to, he done shot me in my shoulder.

Boot camp we had classes.
You know we talked about fighting-fighting everyday.
And looking through rosy colored glasses, I must admit it seemed exciting anyway.
Oh, but someone that day overlooked to tell me bullets look better,
I must say - brother - when they're coming at you than going out the other way
And please call up the Rev. Harris. Tell him to ask the Lord to do some good things for me.
Tell him I aint gonna live-I aint gonna live to get much older.

Whoa, Lord. Strange little man over here in Vietnam I aint never seen - bless his heart-
I aint never done nothing to, he done shot me in my shoulder.

I get a warm summer feeling walking through the snow
Even chilly darkness has the brightest glow
And I just love you so, sometimes I just don't know
Time just seems to help this wondrous feeling grow
Maybe I might wake up early one morning
And find it isn't so

I just love you so
Sometimes I just don't know

Feeling like a rich man haven't got a dime
Feeling like a young man but I'm old as father time

And I just love you so
Sometimes I just don't know
I just don't know

I wish you flowers sunshine and smiles
I wish you children that grow to make you proud
I wish you pretty things to wear
Sweet things to smell

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you good friends that always treat you fair
Wanna wish you ribbons to tie around your hair
I wish you truckloads of cheer and many happy years

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

Wanna wish you freedom to do the things you love
Wanna wish you blessings and kindness from above
Wanna wish you sunlight through the clouds
Hope you laugh out loud

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

How do you do, Lucy?
You sure been hard to find
I heard you had a daughter six years old
And I just can keep from crying

Six years and Lucy
Lord, have mercy
That's a long time
That's a long time

Is she pretty? Has she grown?
Does she sleep well in a room of her own?
Can I see her? Does she know
That I'm her daddy? I'm her daddy

Did you give her love, love, one of my pictures?
Does she carry, yeah, yeah, picture with her?
Does she show it to the baby sitter
And say, see that man, that's my daddy
That's my daddy, yeah

You should have told me, Lucy
You should have told me, Lucy
You should have told me, Lucy
Poor Lucy, poor Lucy, poor Lucy, oh Lucy
You should have told me, Lucy
You should have told me, Lucy

People try to create feelings just the same as love.
In the name of love, in the name of love.
For the sake of silly passion make a game of love.
In the name of love, in the name of love.

Jumping up and down on your emotions.
Just another way to break your heart.
And it really makes you wonder what became of love.
In the name of love.

They make all the sacrifices for the sake of love.
What they make of love, is old heartbreak of love.
When there ain't no giving in the give and take of love.
But blame on love, in the name of love.

Jumping up and down on your emotions.
Just another way to break your heart.
And there really ain't no feeling quite the same as love.
In the name of love.

People try to create feelings just the same as love.
In the name of love, in the name of love.
For the sake of foolish passion make a game of love.
In the name of love, in the name of love.

Coming up and down with real devotion.
There's a better way to win my heart.
And there really ain't no feeling quite the same as love.
In the name of love.

It ain't because of me, baby
That you're bein' alone
Nobody's fault but your own
If you've been lonely
Because if only, reach out for me

You'll reach out for me, baby
I'm as close as your phone
Ever since you've been gone
I've been home
And home ain't home

Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now (2x)

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried 
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now (2x)

Well, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now (4x)

I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow

Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew

And darling when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you.

When I'm kissing my love, 
I can hear a thump thumping in my head 
When I'm kissing my love 
I close my eyes and see a pretty city with a million flower beds 

I can hear the angels sing, 
Songs that only angels sing 
And I can feel my heart just a-thumping and a-skipping 
When I'm kissing my love 

When I'm kissing my love, 
I feel the blood pump-pumping in my veins 
When I'm kissing my love 
She's such a tender send with a sweet young frame. 

She's so good at what she does, 
All she wants to do is kiss and hug, 
She's got me in love 
And I can feel my heart just a-thumping and a skipping 
When I'm kissing my love
I love you, and I love you and I love you too
Baby will you call me the moment you get there
Hey baby, I love you, and I love you too, and I love you
Baby will you call me the moment you get there, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Because you are taking me with you
And I'm keeping you right here in my arms

It's all because I love you, ooh hoo, and I love you, and I love you too

I tried so hard, my dear, to show 
That you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do 
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past 
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

Another love before my time 
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now 
For things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said 
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts 
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

There was a time when I believed 
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart 
Is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

Oh come back, baby
Baby please don't go, yeah
'Cause the way I love you
You'll never know
Come back baby
Let's talk it over, yeah one more time
Oh oh, yeah

Well I admit, baby (yes I admit)
That I was wrong (that I was wrong)
Don't you know, baby (don't you know baby)
You've been gone too long (gone too long)
Come back baby
Let's talk it over, he, he, one more time
Oh yeah

Now one of these days, baby (one day)
And it won't be long, no, no (one day soon)
You gonna look for me, yeah
And I'll be gone
So come back, yeah
Oh, let's talk it over one more, one more, one more time
Yeah one more time

If I could holler
Like a mountain jack
People must learn how to give
Call my baby back
Come back baby
Let's talk it over one more time
Yeah, one more time, yeah

Come back baby
Let's talk it over (let's work it out)
Yeah, one more time
Oh yeah, one more time
I say, one more, one more time
Oh, one more time
Baby, just one more time
Oh, one more time
Yeah one more time

You're asking me to
Understand your feelings
To just forget about my own
And let you go

Darling, I won't
Raise a hand to stop you
Just let me say one thing
Before you go

[Chorus]
Come to me
Whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand
And there I'll be
My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me

I believe that time alone
Will change you
The changing tides
Will bring you back to me

And when you grow tired
Of chasing rainbows
Just make a wish for love
And there I'll be

[Chorus]

Ooh, come to me
Whenever you get lonely
(Come to me, baby)
Just reach out your hand
And there I'll be
Yeah, yeah, yeah

My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me, sweet baby

Come to me
Whenever you get lonely

Log on to kill this message.

(Oh, yeah, come to me, baby)
Just reach out your hand
(Reach out, reach out)
And there I'll be

My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me

(If you ever get lonely)
Come to me
Whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand
And there I'll be
(Reach out for me)
(Sweet baby, I'll be there)

My love will light your
Way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love
Come to me, yeah

I say I'll move the mountains
And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy, he calls me
Sure I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I'd say

I say I'll go through fire
And I'll go through fire
As he wants it, so it shall be
Crazy, he calls me
Sure I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see

Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while

I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy, he calls me
Sure I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I

Nobody knows except my pillow at night
All through the day how many tears I have to fight
Oh when I'm all alone yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
Oh I cry
I cry
Oh yeah

Nobody sees except my mirror on the wall
I'm not the fairest I'm the bluest of them all
And, Oh 
When I'm all alone yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
I cry
I cry
Oh yeah

Each day I say tomorrow will be my lucky day
Ah ha yeah
And my pillow will be surprised when I come home with a glad eye
And the mirror on the wall will see that I am happy one more (?)

No more nights staring at daddy's chair 
Because I know that you will be standing there
Oh oh, when I'm alone I won't

Cry like a baby
Cry like a baby

Oh yeah
Said I won't cry
I won't cry like a baby
Wooo hooo no
Oh ho yeah
I said that I ha

Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Look at my love blowing away
He's the kind of guy that would say
"Hey, baby let's get away
Let's go some place, low"
Were I don't care
He's the kind of guy that'll give you everything
You trust your heart, share all of your love
Till death do you part
I want to be what he wants
When he wants it and whenever he needs it
When he's lonesome and feelin' love-starved
I'll be there to feed him
Lovin him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say,
"Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere owww"
(baby can we)
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Look at my mind floating away
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you

Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know
You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

And oh, don't cry
Don't cry baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

Don't cry, don't cry baby
Don't cry baby
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know
You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

And oh, don't cry
Don't cry baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

I don't want nobody
Always
Sittin' around me and my man
I don't want nobody
Always
Sittin' right there
Lookin' at me and that man
Be it my mother, my brother or my sister
Would you believe, I'll get up, put on some clothes
Go out and help you find somebody for dissolving that pain
Yes I will

Now I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me
Every once in a while,
Yes it is, ah
I tell you I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me
Every once in a while,
Yeah
But oh, when me and that man get to lovin'
I tell you girls
I dig you but I just don't have time
To sit and chit and sit and chit-chat and smile

Don't send me no doctor
Fillin' me up with all of those pills
I got me a man named Doctor Feelgood
And oh, yeah, that man takes me off all o' my pains and my ills
His name is
Doctor Feelgood in the mornin'
And taking care of business
Is really this man's gain
And after one visit to Doctor Feelgood
You'll understand why Feelgood is his name
Oh, yeah, oh good God of mine
And the man sure makes me feel real, good

I'm drinkin' again
Thinking of when, when you loved me
I'm having a few
And I'm wishing that you were here

Well I'm making the rounds
Making the rounds and settin' 'em up for total strangers
Let me tell you I'm just being a fool
Hoping that you, you appear

Sure I know I can, I can borrow a smoke
Why I can sit here all night and tell jokers some jokes
But who's gonna to laugh, 
Who's gonna laugh at my broken heart, heart

Drinking again
And thinking of when you, when you left me
And I'm tryin' to get home
With nothin' but a memory, memory
Turn it back, Ernie, just one more time 
I'm trying to, really I'm trying to make it on home
And I ain't got nothing but a bottle of Seagrams
And just a memory

It brings big tears
Into my eyes
When I began
When I began to realize
That I've cried so much
Oh, since you've been gone
I guess I'll drown in
Drown in my own tears
I've been crying
Just like a child
These tears of mine
These tears are running wild
And if you don't think
If you don't think that you'll be home soon
Baby, I'm going to drown, oh yeah, in my own tears

Here without you (you)
I get so lonely and I sure get blue (blue), yes, I do
It seems to keep rainin' (rainin')
Rainin', and raining more and more (more and more)
Oh, here without you, baby,
I sure get lonely and I get so blue,
And every time I look around, it's rainin'
More, and more, and more, and more, and more

Oh, why can't you? (you) Why can't you
Why can't you come on home? (You come on home)
Because I don't wanna be, I don't want to be here all alone
Listen, if you don't think (If you don't)
If you don't think that you're coming home soon (You don't think),
Like this evening,
I believe I'm gonna drown (drown) this morning
I tell you that I'm gonna (drown) gonna drown this evening
And oh! (drown) It's sure gonna get bad in the midnight hour
Don't let him let me, (drown) Don't let him let me
Don't let him let me, Don't let him let me
Drown (goin' down), in my own tears
I don't wanna drown (drown) in my own tears
Oh, I'm gonna drown, yeah, in my
Oh, in my own tears, tears, my tears, tears
Oh, don't let him do it, don't let him do it
I don't wanna drown in my own tears

Sugar baby, be my savior,
'Cause I'm tired, I'm tired I've been eight days on the road
That's right, yes it is, eight days on the road,
Travelin' through the night,
There ain't no town, there ain't no town, there ain't no rest tonight yeah

I'm down and busted, standin' on the county line,
And that's why yeah, that's why I've been eight days on the road, yeah
That's right yes it is, eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night,
There ain't no town, there ain't no town, there ain't no rest tonight

I'm here thinkin', thinkin', I'm thinkin' 'bout what I've done,
And that's why, yeah, I've been eight days on the road
That's right, oh oh eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night,
Another mile gone, it won't be long, I'll make Birmingham tonight, yes I will, yes I will

I'm makin' it back to you baby,

Yeah that's right, yes it is, a million days on the road
Yeah awh I've been steppin', I've been eight days on the road
Ah I've been eight days on the road

I'm Eleanor Rigby, I picked up the rice
In the church where the weddin's had been, yeah
I'm Eleanor Rigby, I'm keepin' my face in a jar by the door
You want to know what is it for?

Well, all the lonely people
Where do they all come from? Yeah
All the lonely people, where do they all belong? Now now

Father McKenzie writin' a words to a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him workin', darnin' his socks in the night
What does he care? Yeah

All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong? Yea!

Um, hum, um, um, um hum, hum, yea!
Eleanor, baby, um hum, hum, um

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wipin' the dirt from his hands
As he walked from the grave

Sayin' all the lonely people, where do, where do they come from?
All over the world, the lonely, lonely, lonely, people
Where do, where do they all belong?
Oh lonely, only the lonely know
Oo ho lonely, only the lonely people know
Just like Eleanor Rigby, yeah, Eleanor, Eleanor Rigby
Only the lonely, yeah the lonely yeh
Loneliness
Yeah gotta love some lonely people

You might wake up some mornin'
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

It's an ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall
Well it don't bother me at all 
It's an ever changing time

And me, ever changing time 
Everything is going so much faster
It seems like I'm
Watching my life, and everything I do 
Wonder if the dreams that I believed in
Still come true 

Caught in between, it comes back to
You and me running out of time, I gotta find me a better understanding 
Everything keeps forgetting whats mine, I gotta find me a way, less-demanding 
And we're holding on so tight, together, all of our lives 

And I, I had some big idea 
So much of my life, still not completed 
Hopes and Fears 
Watching it change, into something new 
Wondering it I'm gonna find the answer, loving you 

All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time, I gotta find me a better understanding 
Everything keeps forgetting whats mine, I gotta find me a way, less-demanding 
And we're holding on so tight, together, all of our lives 

[x2]
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time

All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time, I gotta find me a better understanding 
Everything keeps forgetting whats mine, I gotta find me a way, less-demanding 
And we're holding on so tight, together 
And we're gonna be alright[i], together, all of our lives 

[x5]
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all 
It's a ever changing time

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I die
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go
Every little hurt does
Every little hurt does
To you I am a toy
And you're the girl
Who has the say
Why I should play 
Yeah you hurt me
Desert me I just can't take
The loneliness you give me
I just can't go
Another night this way
Come back to me
Darlin' you'll see
I can give you all the things
You wanted me for
If you will stay with me
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I die
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go
Come back to me
Darlin' you'll see
I can give you all the things
That you wanted me for
If you will stay with me
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts

Here we go with the trick questions
They bring up to break down confidence
Always throw out a sly comment
Like is your man faithful 
What time does he get home?

Don't worry I ain't gonna need your help
I'm gonna watch y'all go home by yourself
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love
Is a whole lot better than none

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool

Skip the drama, use common sense
You don't have love if you don't have patience
He's out in the street but don't forget
My twice a week and that almighty paycheck

See I don't even sweat it
I get so much happiness 
If I just put up with a lil' bit a bullsh**!
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love is a whole lot better than none

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool

Think no evil when somebody comes home
Hear no evil, I don't want to know
See no evil, I just wanna see love
Because somebody always takes care of everybody's wants
Don't interrogate 'bout how he spends his spare time
Whatever he chooses to do is fine
'Cause in my heart I believe he's all mine
'Cause you think I can't see
Doesn't mean that I'm blind

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Everybody's somebody's fool (Repeat)

Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Oh sha sha - we got to live together
I am no better and neither are you
We are basically the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag l'm in
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
There is a long hair that doesn't accept the short hair
Sister and brothe let's be cool with each other, ooh

And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Oh sha sha-we got to live together

There is a yellow one
That ain't into the red one, who don't like the black one
What about white one y'all?

And different strokes for different folks

I'm an evil gal, don't you bother with me, no
I said I'm an evil gal, don't you mess around with me, mmhmm
Well I'll empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery, yes I will!

If you tell me good mornin'
I'm gon' tell you that's a lie
If you say hello baby I'mma give you the evil eye
I'mma evil gal, don't you mess around with me, mmhmm
I'm gonna empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery, yes I will

I want caviar for breakfast, champagne every night,
I want a midnight snack for every man that I invite
I'm an evil gal, don't you mess around with me, no
So goodbye baby, I'm gonna set you free

Whoa if you wanna be happy, honey don't you mess around with me, yeah
I said if you wanna be happy, don't you mess around with me, no
'Cause I'll empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery
Yeah, yeah I'm evil

Oh if you wanna be happy, don't you hang out with me, no more
I said, if you wanna be happy, honey, don't you hang out with me
You'd better not
'Cause I'll empty your pockets and I'll set you free
And I'm so jive, yes I am

I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you

It's in the way you say my name
Though I hear your voice, it's not the same
And in your eyes, I can't help but see a much different light
Than there used to be

You say hello and I want to die
'Cause deep down I know that it means goodbye
I can't let go, I just keep hanging on
Though you're standing there, you're as good as gone
Though you're standing there, you're good as gone

Are you falling out of love?
Baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love?

Your funny smile was all it took
And you said it all with just a look
Now I sit here and you sit there
We just talk and talk but we get nowhere
All we do is talk and get nowhere

Are you falling out of love?
Oh baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love?

Are you falling out of love?
Oh baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love?
Falling out of love

(First snow in Kokomo)
The first snow in Kokomo
Off an Indiana highway, I was on my way to Kokomo
A funny friend named Chuck slipped and bumped his head (oops)
And as we picked him up, asked us had his nose turned red
That was the first snow in Kokomo

Kenny learning to blow his horn
I was feeling right up to it
Could it be done, yes, I could do it
That first snow in Kokomo

Jimmy Dee playing a bass, he was learning to play
Applegate discovered a coronet, almost right away
Reggie expecting a baby, and was Freddy kinda blue
That was the first snow in Kokomo

Jimmy Dee has put his bass away (put away)
And I wonder if Applegate ever learned to play?
Kenny is really, really blowing his horn
And a baby named Moishe has been born (pretty little baby)
Freddy's getting ready to make things right (right on, Freddy)
Since that first snow
That first snow in Kokomo (first snow in Kokomo)
The first snow in Kokomo

For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know

Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doin'
But you must be livin' right, yeah

Oh, we got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump right in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine

City traffic movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?

Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit 'til we get
To the other side, ide, ide

With the radio playin' our song
We keep rollin' along
Who knows how far our car can get
Before you think your love slowin' on down

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go come on now, go

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac? Oh yeah

Here we go, one more time mmm
With the wind and your fingers in my hair
Kind of think we're going for an extended throw down
So drop the top baby
And let's cruise on into this better than ever street

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, come on baby, go, do it for me now

We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against my back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac? 

What I want you to do baby
Get over to the left lane
And let's merge with peace, oh yeah
Take the love that's sent ya
And then in the right time
Go on over in love and satisfaction and joy, well
Ain't we riding babe, ain't we cruising down
Free, free, sweet
Go on after, awh let's be good to each other street
Well, see that little landmark over there
A whole lot of kisses and sweet stuff
We'll be just about, awh, awh, awh
And satisfaction road yeah, satisfaction yeah ooo ahhh

Thee I love, more than the meadow so green and still
More than the mulberries on the hill
More than the buds of a May apple tree, I love thee
Arms have I, strong as the oak for this occasion
Lips have I, to kiss thee too

In friendly persuasion, thee is mine

Though I don't know many words of praise
Thee pleasures me in a hundred ways
Put on your bonnet, your cape, and your glove
And come with me, for thee I love

Friendly persuasion, thee is mine
Though I don't know many words of praise
Thee pleasures me in a hundred ways
Put on your bonnet, your cape, and your glove
And come with me, for thee I love

It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

Morning
Some of y'all may think 
That this next track
A little risky for a Luther joint
But all you gotta do is listen to get it
Get it right
Alright, ch'all, lets start from number one
And get down till it's done

Now watch this sketch as I stretch this mall
Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen, Mission Impossible
Keep it general like the hospital
Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu
The Pre to the C-I-S-E do

Let's get this thing to workin'
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start it
We all could use the change

Do it till we get it, get it right
Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get
Stay with it and get it right
Do it till we get it
Never stop, Luther take it to the top
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

Get all up in your back and down your spine
Got to keep it on track like the A train line
To the junction out in Brooklyn
What's your function
Keep you lookin' once again
As I punch in those lines like the SV-1200
Precise on the mic, you
But we gon' get top shot at the party
Started rockin'
And I got first dibs on the dark skinned kid

And I know just how to do it
To make it really nice
There's no mystery to it
Do it till you get it right

Do it till we get it, get it right
Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get
Stay with it and get it right
Do it till we get it
Never stop, Luther take it to the top
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

Feels so good to get it
Get it
It's so good to get it
Get it, get it right
Feels so good to get it
Get it
It's so good to get it
Get it, get it right

And oh, don't give up now
We can make it, we can take it right to the top
Come on and never stop
Oh, and let's reach for the sky
And if we keep believing we can never go too high
Why don't we give it a try
Come on and keep reaching up
And don't you worry
No, you won't use up your stuff
No way to get enough
Do it till we get it right
And even if it takes from morning till way into night
We got to

Do it till we get it, get it right
Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get
Stay with it and get it right
Do it till we get it
Never stop, Luther take it to the top
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get it
Stay with it and get it right
Never stop, Luther take ya to the tpo
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

How y'all feeling tonight
Better hold on tight
Throw your hands in the air If you're getting it right
What we got you'll like
But it's not quite the regular jam
Luther and Precise
How y'all feeling tonight
Better hold on tight
Throw your hands in the air if you're getting it right
What we got you'll like 
But it's not quite your regular jam
Luther and Precise

Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding round the door
When you're gone, spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
He just worry 'bout nothin'
'Cause he's got his own

I have had my fun, if I don't get well no more
I want to tell you I've had big fun if I don't get well no more
You see my health is failing
And I'm going down slow, yes I am

Now what I want you to do for me
Somebody write my father, tell him the shape that I'm in, oh yeah
Oh early tonight will someone call my father, 
Tell him the, tell him the shape that I'm in, oh yeah 
And while you're talkin' to him, tell him to pray for me
And tell me to forgive me, forgive me for all my sins
Yeah forgive me for my sins

Tell him that I'm heading on my way,
Look for, look for me close home, oh yeah
Tell him early one morning to look for, to look for me close home, yeah
You tell him just in case he don't see my body
Oh he can do, all he can do is stand there and moan
And I believe he can do, yes he can, yeah, yes he can, yeah

Mmmmmmmmm

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah oh
Early one morning
I'm coming on home
And I believe I'll make it there, yes I do, yes I do
And I tell you, I tell you that
Early one morning I'm going on home
And I believe to my soul yeah I'm gonna make it there, yes I do
Oh but just in case, he don't see my body
Let me him know his child has gone out of this world
Some way
Right now I'm going down, oh oh, I'm going down real slow

Extra, extra
Read all about it
Extra, extra
We heard the good news

We've come this far by faith
Pick up your pace and don't you be late
I'm here to tell you about the good news
There's something about the path that we choose

Wisdom has built this house now
Integrity will bring your pride out
If you know how to pray the situation out
You'll get an answer, and there ain't no doubt

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better
And Sunday, we heard the good news

He won't stop blessing you
Look here, what He'll do
Is keep testing you
And a beggar's no less than you
'Cause one day it could be you

So get your folks together for some church
Some good music, prayer, and service won't hurt
Even if you don't like the preacher
There's bound to be a thing or two he can teach you

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news

Deceit is in the heart of them who imagine evil 
Righteousness is the fruit of the tree of all people
And if you want to live your life upright
Pray that the Lord will hold up the light

What you need is love on your side
The power of love won't be denied  
I feel comfortable giving you this advice
Don't make the same mistake twice

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better 
And Sunday, we heard the good news (Repeat)

These are the greatest days of our test of time
We need to be walking with a made-up mind
Walk by faith, not by sight
Then all your battles, you know He will fight 

If the sky changes colors there's so many ways
This world's gonna be a better place some day 
If love and unity, you just believe
Then all your blessings I know you'll receive

Glory to God in the Highest 
Glory, Glory, Glory
Jesus, man who walked on water
Jesus, He's alright, He's alright

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better
And Sunday, we heard the good news (Repeat)

Everybody get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm gonna stay here till I soothe my soul
If it take all night long

Yeah, it might be one o'clock and it might be three
Time don't mean that much to me
I ain't had that much fun since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again

Oh, get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm gonna stay here till I soothe my soul
If it take all night long
Yeah, all night
Takes all day
All night
And all day
I'm gonna get in the groove and let the good times roll
Stay here till I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long, yeah

It might be one o'clock, and it might be three
I don't care, 'cause time means nothin' to me
I ain't been swingin' since I don't know when
And I might not be swingin' this way again

Oh, get in the groove and let the good times roll
You can stay here 'til you soothe your soul
If it takes all night long, yeah

All night, and all day
All night, and all day
I'm gon' stay here, I ain't gonna move
Come on, soul brotha, help me find the groove
I don't care who's knockin' on the door

If you had a dollar
And I had a dime
I wonder, could I borrow yours
As easy as you could mine?
Because when you need my love
And I give time after time
And turn around to find me no returns,
Then my friend, you've used my dimes

If there's water in the pitcher,
And we both need a drink
To stay alive, my darlin',
I'd need less water than you think

My love, my love, these things, I swear, I say are true
And all I'm really saying is be as good to me as I am to you
Oh, yeah

Listen to this
Some people want,
But they don't wanna give
They can do all of the wrong in the world
And got the nerve to not understand the meaning of loving me
Starting today,
Tomorrow, and forevermore
If you can't find it in your heart to do for me
Then, baby, just don't darken my front door

Baby,
I want you to be as good to me as I am to you
Whoo, baby!
I don't think that's asking you too much to do
Listen! Don't you walk around here
Feeling like you can treat me any old way
Using my love, my time, my heart, day, day after day
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, baby, baby, be as good to me as I am to you
Whoo! Whoo!
Baby

On a Sunday afternoon (Sunday, Sunday)
Really couldn't get away too soon (too soon)

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd like to be instead of

Groovin'
Down a crowded avenue (strolling down on broadway)
Doin' anything we like to do

There's always lots of things that we could see
We could be anyone we want to be
And all those happy people we could meet just

Groovin' (groovin', groovin', baby)
On a Sunday afternoon (groovin', groovin, baby)
Really, baby, I couldn't get away too soon (too soon)

We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it comin' closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly

Groovin' (groovin', groovin', baby)
On a Sunday afternoon (groovin', groovin', baby)
Oh, really, I couldn't get away too soon, baby
(Groovin', just groovin', just groovin', baby)
'Cause darling, you sent me
Groovin'

My mother told me
'Fore she passed away
Said son when I'm gone
Don't forget to pray

'Cause there'll be hard times
Lord those hard times
Who knows better than I?

Well I soon found out
Just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes
Just to pay the rent

Talkin' 'bout hard times
Lord those hard times
Who knows better than I?

I had a woman
Who was always around
But when I lost my money
She put me down

Talkin' 'bout hard times
Hard times
Yeah, yeah, who knows better than I?

Lord, one of these days
There'll be no more sorrow
When I pass away

And no more hard times
No more hard times
Yeah, yeah, who knows better than I?

Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ was born in Bethlehem

Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a newborn King

Christ, by highest heaven adored
Christ, the ever, everlasting Lord
Late in time, behold Him come
Offspring of a Virgin's womb

Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel

Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory, glory, glory to a new born King

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild

A new born King

If they had ever told me
How sweet a kiss could be
I would have said, impossible,
Impossible for me

And if they said, you'll find love
Beyond the rainbows end
I would have said, Impossible,
Impossible, my friend.

To dream about what might have been
Is strange enough for me
But now it seems I'm livin' in
A dream too beautiful to be

If they had said a moonbeam
Would calm a stormy sea
I would have said, impossible,
But now at last I see
That nothing is impossible
If you are here with me.

[Chorus]
Heavenly Father
You're the One We're Waiting on
Because without you there's no way that I can stay strong
I can't go on any longer on my own
So hear me when I say
Heavenly Father, we need your help today

Dada ding ding ding 
I'm ringin your bell
Yes it's me
Come on now let me in
I've got to see you
And no one else will do
I need your help

You said if ever there was a time a time I needed you
You would come through
Yes if ever there was a time and time we needed you
You know that it's everyday every way 

[Chorus]

Lord I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
And you say, you know it really doesn't matter at all
I'm gonna make it
'Cause Your word said I could
And I believe

You said if ever there was a time a time I needed you
You would come through
Yes if ever there was a time and time we needed you
Yes if ever there was a time and time we needed you
You know that it's everyday every way 

[Chorus]

Hello sunshine
(Hello)
So glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine
(Hello)
It's been dark for a very long time

I can't explain what I've been through
(No, no)
Trying to live my life without you
People say I act so strange
(Oh, yeah)
But you got the power to make me change

Hello sunshine
(Hello)
I'm so glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine
(Hello)
It's been dark for a very long time

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place
(Lonely)
And without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space
(My heart)

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain
The wonders of spring
Don't mean a thing

Without you, baby
Without you, baby
Without you, baby
Without you, baby
(Without you)

Now I know everything is alright
(You know)
No more pain, no more sleepless nights
(Oh yeah)
My days were dark but now I see
(Oh yeah)
Because my sunshine has come home to me.

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place
(Oh yeah)
And without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space
(Oh yeah)

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain
(Oh yeah)
They don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing)
The wonders of spring
(Don't mean a thing)

Without you, baby
(Don't mean a thing)
Without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)
Oh, without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)
Oh, without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)

Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

I'm on my way, your lover
If you get cold, I will be your cover
Don't have to worry, 'cause I'm here
Don't have to suffer, baby, 'cause I'm here

Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

Reach out to me for satisfaction
Call my name for quick reaction
Baby, baby, yeah

Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, 'cause I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

Just hold on, I'm coming
Just hold on, hold on

Oh how it hurts, like child birth
The wounds heal slow, you just don't know
At times, I don't know what to say
And all I do is pray, day to day
But still, I feel my strength might die
Like right now, I'm tryin' hard not to cry
Even when I close my eyes, I still see it
Damn, I just don't believe it
The bad times I buried, like the cemetery
Unworthy people playin' beneficiaries
A lotta people eatin' off of one man's death
Don't you worry B.I., I'ma ride to my last breath
You killas, caused a lotta devastation
You have no idea what you did to this nation
I fuckin' hate you, excuse my frustration
But just when I'm about to quit, God tells me to just

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better

Frank White, the man with the money and the fame
Passed away, now bitches wanna claim his name
I been with my nigga before he came in the game
No one's, no V's, we used to take the train
Just us and the Mafia goin' out to parties
I guess back then we was real nobodies
But he was my nigga, and I was his bitch
I rolled hard with him, how could I forget him
Had beef with yo wife that ain't patched up
But still got love for your kids
Even wrote 'em in my will
And I'ma make sure the fam keep a decent meal
No matter what I got to do, or who I got to kill
Shit is real, baby, there ain't no appeal
If I'm fucked up, imagine how Mrs. Wallace feels
Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
So to my ladies, don't think I haven't walked in yo shoes
Or thought this was only happenin' to you, righ'
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on this boo
Cuz trust me, I know exactly what you're going through

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better

So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
Depressed, stressed, don't know who's my real friends
One thing's for sure, I can count on my mens
D-Roc, Money, L, Lil' Cease, and PD
My whole B.I. family, remind me of you
We miss you so much, I love you so much
Never thought life without you would be so rough
But I know we gon make it
We ain't happy, but we fakin'
And to New York, thanks for the support
And all our real fans, I'm shoutin' out the whole land
This is somethin' young kids just won't understand
How they took away this beautiful man
Who shared so many memories
I could go on and on, but a song can only be so long
It's been hard, but I told God that I put up a fight
So here's a Long Kiss Goodnight, Frank White

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better

Mmm...
Oh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

I gave you my heart
And I gave you my time
I gave you all of my money
Anything to keep you satisfy, yeah, yeah

But the one thing I didn't count on
Is that you would do me so bad
If there's one thing I know I love you for sure
I don't understand why did you treat me so bad

Honey (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey baby (Honey baby)

Honey
Why do I love you so much (Oh...)

I gave you the world, baby
Anything that your heart desires
And I didn't ask for one thing in return
I was there for you right down to the wire

So why'd you have to draw me, baby
You did everything again
And where it's comin' from, and I still can't let go
I'm losin' my hair and I don't understand

Honey (Honey)
Honey baby (Honey baby)

Honey (Oh...oh...)
Why do I love you so much

I can understand if it wasn't good enough
I was too good to the end, much too good for you
Other folks say you just ain't no good
I try to let go, but I still need to know

Honey
Honey baby (Oh...oh...oh...oh...)

Ooh baby, nothing to be shy about
Nothing we have to lie about
Hope lovin' you don't confuse you
Ooh baby baby, I don't wanna lose you

And when we touch our hearts move at a steady pace
I'm tryin' hard not to show the blushin' over my face
Ooh yeah yeah, you bring out the woman in me
What can I see that you can't see?
I like the way we carry on
Hope you understand my feelings got me just a reeling

What can I do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love
What can I do with this sweet feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love, ooh

Your eyes within me, they send me just a starin' me down
I'm so turned on in time and child, I got to move around
Ooh yes I do, over and over you astound me
I take pleasure to have you around me
My lovin' arms would love to squeeze you
Ooh baby take it, I don't want to tease you

What can I do, ooh with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
What can I do?

Hooked on your love sweet love love

Nothing to be shy about

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?

How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things to say?

And since we know we're always changing
Why should it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear the name?

I know the way you feel for her
It's now or never
The more I love the more that I'm afraid
That in her eyes I may not see forever

Forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends

If we can try with everyday to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends

I know (How do you keep the music playing?) 
The way I feel for her, it's now or never
(How do you make it last)
The more I love the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever

Forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends

If we can try with everyday to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose
The music never, never, never ends

My love has no beginning, my love has no end,
No front no back, my love won't bend,
I'm in the middle, I'm lost in a spin
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

My love has no bottom, my love has no top
My love won't rise, my love won't drop
I'm in the middle, and I can't stop
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

I wish I was a poet, so that I could express,
What I, what I like to say,
I wish I was an artist, so that I could paint a picture
Of how I feel, how I feel today, today

My love has no walls on either side,
That makes my love wider than wide,
I'm in the middle, no and I can't hide,
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know,
How glad I am
No you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know,
How glad I am
How glad I am
How glad I am

On the way to the great carnation

How many times you're gonna let him use you 
You'd think that you would know by now 
How could you let him treat you so bad 
How many times will you let him break your heart 
I heard he lied to you 
I heard your love he abused 
Don't say it isn't so 
I see it in your eyes 
It's something you can't hide 
How many times you gonna let him use you 
You'd think that you would know by now 
How could you let him treat you so bad 
How many times will you, let him break your heart 
He gives you lonely nights 
And he can hear you cry 
And love you he denies 
He's never gonna change 
He just can't accept the blame 
How many times you gonna let him use you 
You'd think that you would know by now 
How could you let him treat you so bad 
How many times will you, let him break your heart 
Girl dry your eyes 
Get up off your face 
Don't be ashamed. find someone else new 
Someone who'll appreciate you 
Always love you 
How many times you gonna let him use you 
You'd think that you would know by now 
How could you let him treat you so bad 
How many times will you, let him break your heart

If I told a lie, if I made you cry
When I said goodbye, I'm sorry
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
If I caused you pain, I know I'm to blame
Must have been insane, believe me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
I realize I've been unfair to you
Please let me make amends
Don't say that you forgot the love we knew
After all, we were more than friends
If I made you blue, I've had heartaches too
Now I beg of you, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
Give me back your glance, give me back romance
Give me one more chance, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize

I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
As far as I can see
You will always be
The one for me
Oh yes you will

I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down
I will always be around
Just to be right there where you are my love
Oh I love you boy

I will never leave you out
I will always let you in
To places no one's ever been
Deep inside can't you see
I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I would play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
Love's a miracle
And baby you're a dream come true
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me
I was lost now I'm free girl
I believe in you and me

You've been running around
This I know, yeah
I ought to pack my things
And let you go

But baby
I don't know what to do
I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Whoa, no, I can't
See myself leaving you

You've been running around
With every girl in town
Yes, you have

If I just had the power
I'd put you right down
Whoa, oh, my love

I don't know what to do
Cause I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Oh no, I can't
See myself leaving you, no

True love
Is so hard to find
Tell me, tell me
That I've got mine

If I go
Searching for another
I'd just be wasting
My time, yeah, hey

I say we're through
Because I love you
Yes, I do
If I leave you, baby
What would I do?

Whoa, oh, oh, my love
I wouldn't know what to do
Cause I can't see
Myself leaving you

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I can't see myself
Leaving you, no

I can't see myself
Leaving you

Whoa, no
I can't see myself.

I don`t love you anymore
Not the way I did before
And since you`ve found someone new
I think it`s best
I don`t cry and walk the floor
I don`t love you anymore
Trouble is I don`t love you any less
I don`t love you anymore
For I`ve got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love
With every sweet caress
I keep sayin` o`er and o`er
`I don`t love you anymore`
Trouble is I don`t love you any less
I held you close to me one time
Kissed your lips and called you mine
But another came and thrilled you more, I guess
I cried as you walked out the door
`I don`t love you anymore`
Trouble is I don`t love you any less
I don`t love you anymore,
For I`ve got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love
With every sweet caress
I keep sayin` o`er and o`er
`I don`t love you anymore`
Trouble is I don`t love you any less

There was a time when men were kind
Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed

[Chorus]
I got your love
It's all that i got
I got your love
It's all i ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about

Baby In the heart of my heart I want more
Of the man who just walked through that door
The only one that my eyes see

Baby the moments have drifted away
And the hours became lonely days
You're the answer to what i have prayed
I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

[Chorus]

Baby, losing you's all that i fear
And I'm losing it when you're not here
I never could go on without you

Baby, I feel like a shower of light
And I need you right here by my side
I'm craving you all of my life

I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

[Chorus]

Aah you move me
Baby
Aah you move me

I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
All I ever think about (come to me baby)
All I ever think about (come to me baby)
All I ever think about
Your love

Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows

And was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartace, yes I did
I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith
Kept my faith

And the river was deep 
I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me, uh uh

With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
No, I don't regret a single moment, no, I don't
I know you don't, looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do) I just laugh

When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we share was meant to be
(I knew you were waiting)
(I knew you were waiting)
I knew you were waiting, (I knew you were waiting for me)

(I even thought that) I even thought that love
(I still believe) when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) nothing can stop me now
(Knew you were waiting, know I knew you were waiting for me)

(I even thought that) when the mountain was high
(I still believe) oh, when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) no, it didn't stop me
(Knew you were waiting for me, knew you were waiting for me)

(I didn't falter) oh yeah
(I still believe) oh, I still believe
(It didn't stop me) do you know it didn't stop me, now?
(Knew you were waiting) somewhere, some way, some place, somehow
For me

(I didn't falter) when the valley was low
(I still believe) I still believe
(I believe, I believe, I believe) it didn't stop me now (oh, it couldn't stop me now)

I may never get to heaven by Conway Twitty

I walked with you and talked with you and held
Your lovin' hand
We loved a while and I lived a while and I
Thought that fate had it planned
Then someone stole my angel and I lost what
I loved most
I may never get to heaven but I once
Came mighty close

I may never play a golden harp or spread
Celestial wings
Or walk a golden staircase while a distant
Chorus sings
But once I had your sweet love and felt
Your tender touch
I may never get to heaven but I
Didn't miss it much

I may never get to heaven but I once
Came mighty close

The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair, now
And wondering what dress to wear, now
I say a little prayer for you

Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me

I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time
I say a little prayer for you

Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me

My darling believe me
For me there is no one
But you

Please love me too
I'm in love with you
(Answer my prayer) answer my prayer babe
(Answer my prayer) say you love me too
(Answer my prayer) answer my prayer babe
(Answer my prayer)

And forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me

My darling believe me
For me there is no one
But you
Please love me too
This is my prayer (answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer now babe (answer my prayer babe)
This is my prayer (answer my prayer)
Answer it right now babe (answer my prayer babe)
Say you love me too
This is my prayer babe (answer my prayer)
I'm in love with you (answer my prayer babe)

We've played the game of 'stay away'
But it costs more than I can pay
Without you I can't make my way
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud and I may act gay
That's just a pose, I'm not that way.
Cause deep down in my heart I say,
I surrender, dear.

Those little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game
Lending a spice to the wooing
Oh, but I don't care who's to blame

When stars appear and shadows fall
Then you'll hear my poor heart call
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear

Oh, to you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear

I take what I want, I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes I am 
I'm never a loser & I'm never bitter, yeah, oh no 
'Cause I take what I want, yeah yeah, baby I want you, yes, you 

I've been watchin' you walk by, & I haven't said a word, not one word 
But now I'm ready to get you & I'm gonna make you my girl, my lovin' girl 
'Cause I take what I want, yeah yeah, baby I want you 

Gonna pick you up now, carry you away, yes I am 
So you better pack up now baby, pack him up today 
Here I come, just a big bad man 
When I walk away, baby, you'll be holdin' my hand 

'Cause I take what I want, I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes I am 
But now I'm ready to get you & I'm gonna make you my girl, my lovin' girl 
'Cause I take what I want, yeah baby I want you 
Nobody but you, baby (Whaddya need now?) 
Nobody but you, your love to be by my side 
Your heart to be by my guide, told your mind 
I love you baby, nothin' but your soul

I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine

First I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
And I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And now you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
As long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey

I said "Lord, give me strength and don't let me fall apart" 
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And now you see me (see me) somebody new
I'm not that tender little person, still sweat for you
So you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
Well I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Oh, no, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to crush me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, oh no  I will survive
'Cause I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey

I, I, I, will, will
I'm a survivor (oh)
I'm  gon' to make it
I'm gonna get stronger 
I'm a survivor (survivor) I'm gonna make it (What?)
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gonna get stronger 
I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gonna worker harder

Are you listing?
Now you know I took all?
Not to fall apart
I will survive, I will survive
But I will survive, I will survive
I take all the strength I had not to fall apart
I can't hold the many pieces of my broken heart
I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that tender little person still in love with you
Oh so you feel like stopping by and just expect me to be free
Well I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Beat it (beat it) get to steppin' (get to steppin')
Keep it moving , get it on down 
Weren't you the one who tried to crush me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble, I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not this is me, I will survive
Sure 'nuff, me ('cause I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive)
I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey

I wish I didn't love you so, my love for you should have faded long ago.
I wish I didn't need your kiss, why must your kiss torture me as long as this.
I might be smiling by now with some new tender friend,
Smiling by now with my heart on the mend,
But when I try, something in my heart says no.
You're still there, I wish I didn't love you so.

I wonder my darling
Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder

My heart, my heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool to let it go on breaking
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh but right now, I wonder

I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm living life just the same
I've been travelling nowhere fast
And what I wanna know, what I wanna know is will it last?

Oh oh I wonder, I wonder my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me again tonight?
Or are you holding someone else real tight?
Ooo yeah-he-he baby I wonder

I've been through, I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm livin' life, livin' it just the same
I've been travelling, been travelling nowhere fast
And what I wanna know right now, what I wanna know is will it last?

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder my my my my my my my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me every day?
Although I may be a million miles away
Right now I wonder

Although I, although I may be a million miles away
Baby, baby, I wonder

Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo

There was a rose I knew
I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing
Not the least bit insecure

Then you came with your slick game
And played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied
Played with the truth, hey hey

Mmm, she never knew what hit her, yeah
Steal her honey, then forget her
A rose, she wears a flower
Tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Now believe me when I tell you
That I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you
And sees nobody else

And now you're so tough tryin' to
Wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin'
Tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings

Oh yeah, when she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is still a rose
She wears a flower, tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow

Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself and love to love
'Cause without him your life goes on

Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Each time I hold someone new
My arms grow cold aching for you
No one can take your place
Darling in my embrace
I'll never be free

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try
No one can satisfy this longing in me

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free

Baby let's go below the surface 
See what we can find 
There's no reason to be nervous 
'Cause it happens all the time 

I don't want to go up to the mountain 
I don't need to go down to the sea 
Gonna sit right here 'till we unravel 
The mystery 

While the lights of the city 
Are shining below 
Gonna hold onto you girl 
And never let go 

While everyone else is just walking around 
In their sleep 
Baby let's dig down 
Dig down deep 
I want to dig down deep 

And I don't want to wait until tomorrow 
'Cause the fortune said that "The time is now" 
It's time to find out what we're doing 
What we're doing anyhow 

Let's go out in the moonlight 
And walk for awhile 
Maybe stay up all night and we could 
Talk for awhile 
Kick off your shoes 

'Cause you've got nothing to lose 
But your sleep 
Baby let's dig down 
Dig down deep 
I want to dig down deep 

It's an open invitation 
So baby don't you cry 
It's a life long celebration 
And I think we're right on time 

It's a feeling in your heart 
And a lump in the throat 
It's a strange and lovely ride 
want to dig down deep inside 

While the lights of the city 
Are shining below 
Gonna hold onto you girl 
And never let go 

While everyone else is just walking around 
In their sleep 
Baby let's dig down 
Dig down deep 
I want to dig down deep 

Could you dig down deep
I want to dig down deep

I'm in love, yes I am
I'm in love, yes I am um!
I'm in love
Hey baby, hey you know I am
In love
Uh, huh you know I am

Friends all wonder
What's come over me
I'm as happy as any girl could be
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love
(Love, love, love)
Believe me I am
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love oh
(Love, love, love)

Yes, I am
Yes, I am
Yes I am
(Love, love, love)
Hoo, whoa, whoa, whoa
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love

And I'm so glad
That it's me who had to change
I'm sproutin' and bloomin'
Like last summer's rose
I'm in love
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love
(Love, love, love)
Oh baby
(Love, love, love)

I'm in love!
(Love, love, love)
In the mornin'
(In, love in, love in, love in, love)
I wake up smilin'
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love!
(Love, love, love)
Smilin' like love
I know where it's at
(In, love in, love in, love in, love)
(Oh I'm in love)
I'm in love
(In, love in, love in, love)
I'm in love
(In, love in, love in, love in, love)
Yes I am!

(Love, love, love)
I'm in love

If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your arms red as flame
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

And if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn
Just how I'd leave in autumn, I never, never would know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air
I know you in autumn and I must be there

Oh would I leave you running merrily, merrily, merrily through the snow?
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow?

If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in springtime
Knowing how in springtime I'm bewitched, bewitched, bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall
If ever I would leave, leave you at all

If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the skies
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in May time
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
No wind in winter would blow
With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow

I gave you my love
But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain
If I lost you

I say I'll move the mountains
And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I say

I say I'll go through fire
And I'll go through fire
As he wants it, so it will be
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see

Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while
I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I

If they had ever told me
How sweet a kiss could be
I would have said, impossible,
Impossible for me

And if they said, you'll find love
Beyond the rainbows end
I would have said, Impossible,
Impossible, my friend.

To dream about what might have been
Is strange enough for me
But now it seems I'm livin' in
A dream too beautiful to be

If they had said a moonbeam
Would calm a stormy sea
I would have said, impossible,
But now at last I see
That nothing is impossible
If you are here with me.

Something is wrong, baby
Is the feelin' gone, baby
Maybe I need to refresh your mind
Think about the love we shared
Think back to the time we cared
Maybe you can find a reason to be here

Oh...I'm the one who loved you, mmm
I'm the one who made it right
I'm the one who was there for you
On those cold and lonely nights

I'm the one who held you
When the world came down on you
And I'm the one who's in love with you
And whose love never stops

In case you forgot
I give love (Ooh) and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell ?cause I care

In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops (Oh...oh...)

Where did mine go (Where did it go) I never shoulda really let you know
you're about to make a big mistake
Now where do you think you find a love at all like mine
Maybe all you're gonna find is heartache

Whoa... I'm the one who loved you
And I'm the one who made it right
I'm the one who was there for you
On those cold, cold and lonely nights

I'm the one who held you
When the world came down on you
And I am the one who was there for you
And whose love never stops

In case you forgot
I give love (Ooh) and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell ?cause I care

In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops

Where will you go to find someone to love you like I do
You can play anything, baby, ?cause you know that it?s true
Sometimes a love like mine comes just once in your life
So you better, better take it, baby, and hold on tight

In case you forgot
I give love and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when (You know it?s true) you fell ?cause I care (I was there for you)

In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops

In case you forgot
In case you forgot
Remember me, hey, remember me, baby, baby
In case you forgot
I was there (I was there) when you fell ?cause I care (Oh...)

In case you forgot
I left you (I left you) satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot

Hear me baby,
Hear me, hear me, hear me, hear me, hear me 
Hear me boy?

Nobody knows me
Not like the way you know me
Nobody showed me 
The ways of love
So now when you hold me
And promise you won't control me
My mama told me 
To always be for sure?

I wanna know 
Will you love me
I wanna know 
Will you care
In the morning?

Oh I want you to treat me right
I don?t want you to play with my mind
I don?t want to be the other woman
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you 
But before I do

Will you love me?

I want you to fill me
I'm ready and oh so willing
I'm willing to give you
Every part of me
So come on and soothe me baby
I want you to touch and move me
You can consume me
Take all of me my love

I wanna know 
If you'll love me
I wanna know 
Will you care
In the morning?

I want you to treat me right
Oh you can't, you can't, you can't, play with my mind
I don't want to be the other woman
No no no no no
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you 
But before I do?

I want to know 
Do we have an understanding
I've got to know 
Are you giving or demanding
I can't give you no more
Cause I've poured out my soul 
All for you
All for you
I got to know
Is there someone else you're loving
Tell me have you got another woman
Would you be a good man
Come on and make a true stand
Can we share our lives?

I wanna know will you love me
I wanna know will you care
In the morning?

I don't want to be the other woman
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you 
But before I do

I wanna know will you love me
I wanna know will you care
In the morning?

It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
The things that you're liable
To read in the Bible,
It ain't necessarily so.

Now David was small but oh my
Little David was small but oh my
He fought big Goliath
Who lay down and dieth
David was small but oh my.

To get into heaven, don't snap for a second
Live clean forget your faults
I take the gospel whenever it's possible
But with a grain of salt

Oh Jonah he lived in a whale
Oh Jonah he lived in a whale
He made his home in
That fishes abdomen
Oh Jonah he lived in a whale

To get into heaven, don't snap for a seven
Live clean forget your faults
I take gospel whenever it's possible
But with a grain of salt

Methuselah lived 900 years
Methuselah lived 900 years
Who calls that livin'
When no gal will give in
To no man what's 900 years

It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
The things that you're liable
To read in the Bible,
It ain't necessarily so.

Ain't necessarily so
Ain't necessarily so
Ain't necessarily so

Oh, baby 
Oh oh, babe 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh, baby 

Love was always supposed to be 
Something wonderful to me 
To watch it grow inside yourself 
To feel your heart beside itself 

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad 
(When you know you've given all you can) 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh 
(You do your best but it's still much too sad) 
Sometimes the pain is just too much, oh oh 
And it hurts like hell, that's the way it feels 

True love, it has no hiding place 
It's not something you just put away 
It's always there inside of you 
Oh, and it shows in everything you do 

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad 
(When you know you've given it your best) 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh 
(You feel a thousand miles from happiness) 
Sometimes the pain is just too much, oh oh oh 
And it hurts like hell, that's the way it feels 

Oh oh, oh oh 
Here we are, the two of us 
So full of love, so little trust 
But dying for some tenderness 
Oh, but too afraid to take the step 

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad 
(When you know what it can put you through) 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh 
(There's nothing funny if it's killing you) 
Sometimes the pain is just too much 
And it hurts like hell, that's the way it feels 

I know if there is any chance 
For us to find our happiness 
We've got to learn to let it go 
Oh, forget all the pain we know 

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad (sometimes it hurts so bad, baby) 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh (sometimes it hurts to even laugh, oh) 
And it hurts like hell, that's the way 
Oh baby, that's the way it feels 
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

It was you
You made me love you
It was you
You made me need you
Darling darling
You made me
You made me love you
Yes you did

It was you
You made me need you
It was you
I'll never I'll never be seein' you
Darling darling
You made me you made me you made me love you

You know I love you
You know I care
Darling darling
You made me you made me you made me love you

You know I love you
You know I care
Darling darling darling darling
You made me love you
Yes you did
Yes you did
Hey baby hey baby
It was you who made me love you
Hey baby
Darling
It was you
It was you darling

Oh I'd work for you, I'd slave for you,
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you!  (what is a knave anyway?)
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along.

I'd gladly move the earth for you, (yeah I'm strong baby, plenty strong)
To prove my love and it's worth to you,
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along.

With all the words, dear, at my command,
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darling, come what may,
My heart is yours, what more can I say? (what do you want me to do, rob a bank?)

(Well listen, I tell ya)
I'd sigh for you, yeah, cry for you,
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you!
If that isn't love, well skip it, it'll have to do,
Until the real thing comes along.

I'd sigh for you, die for you,
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you!
If that isn't love, it'll have to do,
Until the real thing comes along.
9yeah, that's the real thing, so help me!)

I can't cover my feelings
In the name of love
Or play it safe for a while 
Hey that was easy

And if living for myself
Is what I'm guilty of
Go on and sentence me
I'll still be free

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
That this time's just for me

Because it's my turn
With no apologies
I've given up the truth
For those I've tried to please, but now

It's my turn
If I don't have all the answers
At least I know and I'll take my share of chances
And there ain't no use in holding of
Because nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
With no more room for lies
For years that I've seen my life
Through someone else's eyes, but now

My turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least I'll own today

Because it's my, my turn
Oh, it's my turn, yeah
And there ain't no use in holding on
Because nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
'Cause the rain it ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
To see what I can see
And I hope you'll understand
That this time's just for me because it's

My turn
To turn and say goodbye
And I sure would like to know
That you're still on my side, because

It's my turn, yeah
It's my turn, my turn, yes it is

(Yes) yeah, (it's my turn) it's my turn
(Right now) right now, right now yeah
(Yeah) yeah, (it's my turn) it's my turn
(Right now) right now, (it is)

I said it is (yeah) oh yeah
(It's my turn) my turn
(Right now) right now, woah
(Yeah) and I'll be
(It's my turn) that it is y'all
(Right now) and don't you know (it is)

(Yeah) yes it is now (my turn)
Right now (right now)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Oh yeah (it's my turn) it's my turn
(Right now) right now (it is)
(Hey) hey
(It's my turn) I believe (right now)
I'm gonna walk around
(Hey) it's my turn (it's my turn)
Oh yes it is (right now) oh

(Intro: talking)

Jesus hears every prayer
he understands all about us
he watches over his children
he understands all about us
on the streets, in our homes
on the job
Ohhh
Oh Father (repeat)

See we don't have more than this evening
He watches over his children

All this time 
I couldn't shake your memory 
And I never knew the 
Sweetest love was the first 

So what am I supposed 
To do about this curse 
Oh, baby, I've got you to blame 
And I'm calling 
Calling out your name 

Oh, he was so fine 
Jimmy Lee, oh, he was so fine 
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee 

(Jimmy Lee) 
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee 
(Jimmy Lee) 

Find me rushing off 
To school every morning 
Never had a care 
Acting crazy, always laughing 
When I'm running 
Cause I knew you'd meet me 
When I got there 

Stealing kisses in the hall 
Before the first bell 
You smelled so fine 
Though we'd just met 
I guess you knew me so well 
You had the number to my heartline 

(Maybe he knew his stuff) 
Well, just between you and me 
(Maybe you weren't enough) 
He was the first one 

(Maybe he'd seen enough) 
He stole my heart 
And he ran like a bandit 
I don't understand it 

Jimmy Lee, this one's for me 
And I'll always remember 
History, biology 
And that magical December 

Ooh, boy 
Jimmy Lee, where can you be 
If this song ever finds you 
Won't you please explain to me 
Why you left me behind you, yeah 

(Jimmy Lee) Jimmy 

On the average twice a week 
I think I see you 
On some avenue 
Someone laughs or shakes his head 
They way you used to 
I guess I got myself a loose screw 

I grew up and 
Had my share of adventure 
Well, I've had some fun 
But you never need 
To question my intentions 
Cause each guy is just another rerun 

(Maybe he knew his stuff) 
Well, just between you and me 

(Maybe you weren't enough) 
He was the first one 

(Maybe he'd seen enough) 
He stole my heart 
And he ran like a bandit 
I don't understand it 

Jimmy Lee, this one's for me 
And I'll always remember 
Hey, Lord, history, biology 
And that magical December, ah hah 

Jimmy Lee, where can you be 
If this song ever finds you 
Won't you please explain to me 
Why you left me behind you 
Oh, yeah 

(Jimmy Lee) Jimmy, Jimmy 
Jimmy Lee (Jimmy Lee) 
(Jimmy Lee) 

(Maybe he knew his stuff) 
Well, just between you and me 
(Maybe you weren't enough) 
He was the first one 

(Maybe he'd seen enough) 
He stole my heart 
And he ran like a bandit 
I don't understand it, yeah 

Jimmy Lee, this one's for me 
And I'll always, always remember 
History, biology 
And that magical, oh, December 

Jimmy Lee, where can you be 
If this song ever finds you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Won't you please explain to me 
Why you left me, oh, behind you 

Jimmy Lee, this one's for me

Joy, joy 
Joy to the world, the Lord has come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing

Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his love, and wonders of his love
And wonders, wonders, of his love, wonders

Joy to you and me, joy to people, joy to you and me
And wonders, wonders, of his love


Joy
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing

I was born in a crossfire hurricane, well
And I howled at my ma, at the driving rain, ooh yeah

But it's alright, oh, that is a gas
I said, it's all right
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a g-g-gas, oh yeah

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag, yeah
I was schooled with a strap right across my back, oh, yes, I was

But it's alright, and that is a gas
I said, it's all right
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a g-g-gas

I was drowned, washed up and left for dead, yes, sure was
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled, ooh
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yes, I did
I was crowned with a spike right in through my head, oh yeah

But it's all, it's alright, oh, and that is a gas
I said, it's all, alright
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gas, yes, it is

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, jump, jump)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, jump, jump)

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, will you jump?)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Oh, [Incomprehensible] me)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Real gas)

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Girl, yes I was)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(I was schooled with a strap right across my back)

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Oh, yeah)
(I frowned at a crust of bread, yeah)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(I was crowned with a spike runnin' through my head, yeah)
Hallelujah

Just for a thrill
You changed the sunshine to rain
Just for a thrill
You filled my heart with pain

To me you were my pride and joy
But to you, I was merely a toy
A plaything, that you could toss around at will

Just for a thrill
You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along

Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill



Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Well, it was just for a thrill

And baby you, you, made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill

The crowd sees me out dancing
Carefree and romancing
Oh I'm happy with my someone new
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

They see me night and daytime
Oh I'm having such a gay time
But they don't know what I go through
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
All of the tears are in my heart

So darling, can we make up?
Ever, ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

Mm mm, I'm still laughing on the outside
But every day I'm crying on the inside
Because I'm still, still in love with you

Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing

You know I love you girl
But I want you to do right
If you would only straighten up
We'd have a good life
And if you don't believe me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing

Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
You do all your parading
With every guy in town
I try to find you, woman
And you're nowhere to be found

But if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing

You know I love you woman
I can't tell you anymore
If you don't straighten up
I'm gonna walk right out of that door

And if you don't believe me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, oh yes, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, don't you know

When I find myself in times of trouble 
Mother Mary comes to me 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
And in my hour of darkness 
She is standing right in front of me 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. 
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. 

And when the broken hearted people 
Living in the world agree, 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
For though they may be parted there is 
Still a chance that they will see 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. Yeah 
There will be an answer, let it be. 

And when the night is cloudy, 
There is still a light that shines on me, 
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be. 
I wake up to the sound of music 
Mother Mary comes to me 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be, 
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Super highways coast to coast just easy to get anywhere
On the trans continental overload; just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel when there's no destination that's too far
And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are?
 
Living in America, eye to eye, station to station 
Living in America, hand to hand across the nation
Living in America, got to have a celebration!
 
I live in America
I live in America
 
You may not be looking for the promised land
But you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names, like
 
New Orleans

Living in America, hand to hand across the nation
Living in America, got to have a celebration!

You're here, I'm pleased
I really dig your company
Your style, your smile, your peace mentality 
Lord, have mercy on me
I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be
Baby I feel free, come on and go with me 

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation 
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations 
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18 

Your background it ain't squeaky clean (s***) 
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream 
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners 
But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner
I respect that, man you're so phat
And you're all that, plus supreme
Then you're humble man I'm numb 
Yo with feeling, I can feel everything that you bring 

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation 
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations 
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Revelation 3:17 

Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday (Saturday) 
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony 
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots
Or maybe eat some pa**ion fruit 
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent
Come on, come on 

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation 
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations 
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18 

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation 
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations 
Elevations, maybe baby, maybe we can save the nation
Come on, come on

Please don't be offended if I preach to you awhile, 
Tears are out of place in eyes that were meant to smile.
There's a way to make your very biggest troubles small, 
Here's the happy secret of it all.

[Chorus]
Look for the silver lining
When e'er a cloud appears in the blue.
Remember some where the sun is shining, 
And so the right thing to do, 
Is make it shine for you.
 
A heart, full of joy and gladness, 
Will always banish sadness and strife.
So always look for the silver lining, 
And try to find the sunny side of life.

As I wash my dishes, I'll be following your plan, 
Till I see the brightness in ev'ry pot and pan.
I am sure your point of view will ease the daily grind, 
So I keep repeating in my mind. 

[Chorus]

If you look into your heart 
With a positive mind 
Take self inventory of your woman and your glory 

Leave the bad things behind (ooh) 
Everybody's got a story (yes they do) 
About love and the good things 
But for the spices of your life 
You got to pay the price 

If you know what I mean (ooh yeah) 
Telling everybody, out loud
How a girl becomes some proud
When thought there was nothing left 
I do believe I found myself 

And I want to give it to you baby oh yes I do (yeah yeah) 
So if you look into your heart 
With a positive mind 

You can take self inventory of your woman and your glory 
Leave the bad things behind 
I know my man, 
He really loves me we don't have that everyday (oh no no no) 
I know my man really needs me
And what ever he wanna do I wanna do it with you baby (yeah yeah) 

(do do do do) 
Jump on the night 
Love's not an easy game 
And he's strong and he's straight 
Now that I see 
What he's givin' me 
What ever he wanna do 
I wanna do it with you baby 

I'm loving you more and more and more and more 
And giving you all and all of me (yeah yeah)
I say now mercy baby 
I'm loving you more and more and more and more 
I'm giving you all and all of me 

Oh yes I am 
Say mercy baby 
I'm loving you more 
Mercy baby 
Mercy baby 
Mercy baby

People,
People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst

But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

Oh Baby, oh baby, oh baby
I see myself in your face, a reflection of pain
Somebody made you cry over and over again
Still you and I made it through all of this for a reason
Yes, we did
Could it be that we created affair for all seasons

'Cause you and I were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us, there's no other
We're finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together we'll mend all the cracks in our heart
And just love all the hurt away
(Love the hurt away)

Woman, you are the thing that I hoped and I prayed for
You gave your love and I'm happy like never before
Love and I love it
You be the strength and I'll be your shoulder to lean on
You can lean on my shoulder
Building a world and fill our whole place with our love songs

'Cause you and I were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us, there's no other
We're finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together we'll mend all the cracks in our heart
And love all the hurt away

'Cause you and I were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us, there's no other
We're finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together we'll mend all the cracks in our heart
And just love all the hurt away
(Love the hurt away)

Love all the hurt away
(Love the hurt away)
And love all the hurt away
(Love the hurt away)

Yes, we're gonna love
We're gonna love, baby
Yes, we're gonna love all the hurt, baby
We're gonna love, love, love, love, love, love
(Love the hurt away)
All the hurt away

I love and you love
We love
Sweet love
I look and you look
And we found sweet love
And now we know
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

I kiss and you kiss
Each kiss sweet lips
I tease and you squeeze
And we find sweet bliss
That's how we know
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

I'm lucky
And you're lucky too
We're lucky
And we know it's true
Love is so wonderful

I give and you give
We live for love
Each night
Each day
We love sweet love
'Cause ain't it so?
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

We've had a hard time
You and I
Life sent us through some changes
Oh, but somehow we got by

A winding road, a heavy load
Is nothing new, you see
We know that through the bad times
I'll have you and you'll have me

United together
I finally found the one
Who'll love me forever
We two have just become as one

If we just keep this love alive
As time goes on this joy we know
Can't help but grow inside

Some people spend a lifetime
Looking for that special need
I'm so glad my search is over
Darling, I'm so glad that we're

United together
(United together)
I finally found the one
(I finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever
(Who'll love me forever)
We two have just become
(We two have just become as one)

there's nothing we can't overcome
If you let me be your only one
There's nothing we can't overcome
If you let me be your one and only, one and only

Some people spend a lifetime
Looking for that special need
I'm so glad my search is over
Darling, I'm so glad that we're

United together
(United together)
I finally found the one
(I have finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever
(Who will love me and stand by me forever)
We two have just become

United together
(United together)
I finally found the one
(I finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever
(Who will love me and stand by me forever)
We two have just become
(Oh, yes, we have)
We two have just become
(Oh, yes, we have)

United together
(United together)
I finally found the one
(I finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever
(Who will love me, love me, love me)
We two have just become
(We are, we are, we are)

United together
(United together)
I finally found the one
(Finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever
(Who will love me forever)
We two have just become

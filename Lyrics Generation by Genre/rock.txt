As I walk down the highway all I do is sing this song
And a train that's passin' my way helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, is oh so strong
I'm just a simple guy, I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away 
There's nothing more that I can say but on a day like today 
I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you
All I need from you is all your love 
All you got to give to me is all your love 
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm so glad I'm living and gonna tell the world I am 
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man 
One thing that I know for sure gonna give her all the loving 
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can
Standing in the noonday sun trying to flag a ride 
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace, they set the pace, it must be a race 
And the best thing I can do is run
All I need from you is all your love 
All you got to give to me is all your love 
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling 
Walk a while with me
Ohh, you've got so much, so much, so much
Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream, and a pocket full of gold
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh
Really ought to know
I really ought to know
Oh
You know I should, you know I should, you know I should, you know I should
I hear ya knock on my door 
I ain't been saving this scene for ya honey 
Don't wantcha ringin' my bell 
It's too late for you to be my honey 
Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 
Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 
Don't want you wasting my time 
Tired of ya doing the things that you do 
It's no use standing in line 
Follow the line, you better follow queue 
I say, oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 
Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my my own
I could sail a river run dead, but I know it's dead
I could I wish for a million, yeah but I know it's dead
I could cry within the darkness, I sail away 
I save a lifetime forever?
But you know, you know, you know what I say 
And I say oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 
Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my my own 
Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love
Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my own true love
My own true love, my own true love
My own true love
I said Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love
Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my own
Here's a tale of Tom 
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel
Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Always knew what's goin' on 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom 
Worked for thirty years 
Sharing hopes and fears 
Dreamin' of the day 
He could turn and say 
Poor Tom, work's done, 
Been lazin' out in the noonday sun 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
His wife was Annie Mae 
With any man a game she'd play
When Tom was out of town 
She couldn't keep her dress down 
Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Always knew what's goin' on 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
And so it was one day 
People got to Annie Mae 
Tom stood, a gun in his hand 
And stopped her runnin' around 
Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Gotta die for what you've done 
All those years of work are thrown away 
To ease your mind is that all you can say? 
But what about that grandson on your knee? 
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me
(Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom) 
Hey
(Keep-a truckin')
Leaves are falling all around
It's time I was on my way
Thanks to you I'm much obliged
For such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain
And with it pain
And it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams
Got no time for spreadin' roots
The time has come to be gone
And thoough our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going 'round the world, I got to find my girl
on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on
I gotta find the queen of all my dreams
I ain't tellin' no lie
Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air
'T was in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one 
crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ain't nothing I can do, no
I guess I keep on rambling
I'm gonna, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing my song (I gotta find my baby)
I'm going 'round the world (I gotta ramble on sing my song, gotta work my way around the world baby, baby)
Ramble on, yeah
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, my baby
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
I gotta keep searching for my baby (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (my, my, my, my, my, my baby)
Oh, I can't find my bluebird (my, my, my, my, my, my, yeah)
I'd listen to my bluebird sing but I, I can't find my bluebird (yeah, I keep rambling baby)
I keep rambling baby (I keep, I keep, I keep)
I keep rambling baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Oh let me get it back let me get it back
Let me get it back baby where I come from
It's been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time
Yes it has
It's been a long time since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back  carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite
A man I know, went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers, left and right
Whiskers
Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set that room alight
Whiskers
Down on Bourbon street
You know it's right
You can see my friend,
They run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor
Doin' up my hair
New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out, strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White
One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
From the window of your rented limousine 
I saw your pretty blue eyes 
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen 
Painted lady in the city of lies 
Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
You know I'm the one you want, babe 
I must be the one you need, yeah 
Clutching pages from your teenage dream 
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise 
Through the circus of the LA queens 
How fast your learn the downhill side 
Oh, how you like my face? 
Still don't know your name
You know I'm the one you want, babe 
Oh yes, I must be the one you need, yeah
Oh, you got me feeling
Just a bit, just a bit
Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen 
Come on, flash it in my eyes 
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh 
Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
Baby I gotta tell you, I'm the one you want
And everybody know I'm the one you need, yeah
Oh, give it to me, come on now
Hours, hours, and the moments in between 
Oh, baby, I couldn't count the times 
The fun of comin', oh the pain in leavin' 
Baby, dry those silver eyes 
Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
You know I'm the one you want 
Oh yes, I'm the one you need 
Oh, that's right, oh, yes that's right
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right
Oh yeah, that's right
Workin' from seven to eleven every night  
It really makes life a drag  
I don't think that's right
I've really been the best of fools  
I did what I could, yeah 
'Cause I love you, baby  
How I love you, darling  
How I love you, baby  
My beloved little girl, little girl
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah  
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah
Everybody trying to tell me 
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you I really did the best I could 
I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag 
Lord, that ain't right, no no 
Since I've been loving you 
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out
Said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling 
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling 
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door? 
I said you had the nerve to tell me 
You didn't want me no more, yeah 
I open my front door, hear my back door slam
You know, you must have one of them new fangled
New fangled back door man
I've been working from seven, seven, seven to eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag 
Ah, yeah, it makes a drag
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose
I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind 
Just one more, just one more, oh yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm about to lose my worried mind
Uh-look-ah there
There she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when 
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with older guys from out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else
Hey look-ah there
Across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else
Hey look-ah here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
The town will be all shocked with my white top down
I'll keep right on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to myself 
When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else
Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am ah-knockin' on her door 
My car's out front and it's all mine 
Just a '41 Ford not a '59
I got that girl and I'm-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
Wow! She's somethin' else
Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
Oh, it sounds so good, oh so good
With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helpin' hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground
And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh, so good
Baby if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh so much good
With a little bit of stop-a-shakin' shakin'
And a little bit of fly right down?
Ooh, just a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground
Ooh now baby, when you move it makes me
Really feel so good, oh, so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh, so good
With a little bit of concentration
Just a little bit of helping hand
And a little bit of saving madness?
It makes me feel, oh
It makes me feel back on the ground 
Oh yes, it sure does
It makes me feel back on the ground
Babe, babe, you're the girl on the ground, yeah
I'm feelin' good child!
Down on the ground (Sha la la la, sha la la la)
There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who standing looking
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama,
Where you been?
Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama,
Where you been?
Sugar mama, sugar mama

Sugar mama gonna love you all I can

Say you love me sugar mama
I'll never let you go

Say you love me sugar mama
I'll never let you go
Measuring a summer's day, I only finds it slips away to grey
The hours, they bring me pain
Tangerine, Tangerine, living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen, and now a thousand years between
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these? 
To think of us again?
And I do
Tangerine, Tangerine, living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen, and now a thousand years between
How come twenty four hours 
Baby sometimes seem to slip into days? 
Oh, twenty-four hours 
Baby sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah
One minute seems like a lifetime 
Oh baby, when I feel this way 
Sittin' lookin' at the clock 
Time moves so slow 
I've been watchin' for the hands to move 
Until I just can't look no more 
How come twenty four hours 
Baby sometimes seems to slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime 
Baby when I feel this way 
To sing a song for you 
I recall you used to say 
Oh baby this one's for we two
Which in the end is you anyway 
How come twenty four hours 
Baby sometimes seem to slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime 
Baby when I feel this way 
There was a time that I stood tall 
In the eyes of other men 
But by my own choice I left you woman 
And now I can't get back again 
How come twenty-four hours 
Sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah
Well, well, well well
A minute seems like a lifetime 
Baby when I feel this way 
A minute seems like a lifetime 
Oh baby, when I feel this way
I feel this way
Then as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays
On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go
Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be
Did you ever really need somebody 
And really need 'em bad
Did you ever really want somebody 
The best love you ever had
Do you ever remember me, baby 
Did it feel so good
'Cause it was just the first time 
And you knew you would
Through the eyes an' I sparkle
Senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way 
See your feathers preen
Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes 
Didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest 
The nest is in our soul
Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face 
The way it used to be
Oh darlin', oh darlin'
I'm never gonna leave you 
I never gonna leave
Holdin' on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone 
Ten years gone, holdin' on
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die
My, my, my inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration look, see

And so today, my world it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
Mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town
And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play,
What did mama say to me
That's the way,
Oh, that's the way it ought to be,
Mama say that's the way it ought to stay, yeah, yeah oh oh
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river,
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes,
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying,
Had they got you hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers,
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters,
And all you do is stand and cry
I don't know what to say about it,
When all you ears have turned away,
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see,
Is that the way it ought to stay?
That's the way
That's the way it oughtta be
Oh don't you know now
Mama said, mama said, that's the way it's gonna stay, yeah, oh oh
Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go,
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all.
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,
Rest not to lock your homes.
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all.
I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley blow,
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon,
Waiting for the eastern glow.
The apples of the valley hold,
The seas of happiness,
The ground is rich from tender care,
Repay, do not forget, no, no.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red.
Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly.
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know.
Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow,
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath,
The drums will shake the castle wall,
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on.
Sing as you raise your bow,
Shoot straighter than before.
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold.
Oh dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the mornin' light.
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back, bring it back.
At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by,
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes.
I want to tell you 'bout my good thing
I ain't disclosing no names but
He sure is a good friend and
I ain't gonna tell you where he comes from, no
If I tell you you won't come again, hey

And you want me to love you, love some other man too?
Ain't gonna call me Mr. Pitiful, no

And she's the kind of lover that makes me me fill the whole world and
She's the one who really makes me jump and shout, ooh

"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"
Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball, uh uh, uh uh, yeah
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, I play for me and play a whole lot more, more!

Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing about the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start
Oh yeah!
It sure is fine!
Ah blow my mind!
When the tears are goin' down!  
Yeah! Yeah, yeah
Oh so, oh so, oh so good!
Oh so good!
It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oh
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh
Talk talk, talk, talk
Hey, I felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, 'pon us, 'pon us, 'pon us
But I know that I love you so
Oh, but I know
That I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the wind, they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch
We all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient, quotient
Upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh
Ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah
I've been to London, seen seven wonders I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for
There can be no denying, that the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying, and there's a new plague on the land
(If we could just join hands)
(If we could just join)
Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me 
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight  I hear the rested rivers call
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe
(If we could just join hands)
You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stolen
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right
Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry, and I would dearly like to know
I've all this wonder, of earthly plunder, will it leave us anything to show
And our time is flying, see the candle burning low
Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old
(If we could just join hands)
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
(Yeah)
I had a dream
Oh, yeah
Crazy dream, uh-huh
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song
Yeah, people don't you listen now?
Sing along
Oh
You don't know what you're missing, now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow, push push, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh
Here we go, here we go
All you gotta do, now
All you gotta do, now
Ooh-ee
Sing out Hare-Hare
Ooh, dance the Hoochie-Koo
City lights are oh so bright, as we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
Oh
Aboard a train
I met a dame
She was a hipster
Man a real gone dame
She wasn't pretty
For New York City
As we strut down on that ol' fairlane
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
I made a stop round Albuquerque
She must'a thought I was real gone jerk
Got off the train at El Paso
A' looking so good I couldn't let her go
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
Silent woman in the night, you came

Ain't had no lovin', Lord, since you know when 
Spoken: Why don't you come into my kitchen 
She's a kindhearted lady. She studies evil all the time 
She's a kindhearted woman. She studies evil all the time 
Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg 
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed 
Squeeze my lemon, 'til the juice runs down my leg

Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl

She's a good rider 
She's my kindhearted lady 
I'm gonna take my rider by my side 
I said her front teeth are lined with gold 
She's gotta mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul 
She's my brown skin sugar plum
Oh know I  feel so strange looking out the door 
Oh tryin' hard to change but can't let go 
Oh cryin' tears of pain and more and more 
Oh everyday is the same as the one before 
I'm walkin' the floor over you 
I'm walkin' the floor 
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold 
To the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh is it long to wait, is it much to pay? 
Oh sometimes it's hard waiting for the day
You know it's hard I said it's hard 
You know it's true I said it's hard 
You know it's hard you know it's true 
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?
Every love that's changed ?
In the eye of the night  ?

You know it's true now
You know it's true now uh uh yeah
I'm walkin the floor over you

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?
Does it matter now?
It starts out like a murmur 
Then it grows like thunder 
Until it bursts inside of you 
Try to hold it steady 
Wait until you're ready 
Any second now will do 
Throw the door wide open 
Not a word is spoken 
Anything that you want to do 
Ya know, ya know, ya know
Ya know, ya know, ya know
Don't you feel the same way? 
Don't you feel the same way? 
But you don't know what to do 
No time for hesitatin' 
Ain't no time for hesitatin'

Who cares for medication

Yeah, yeah, yeah I can feel it, I can feel it ?
Oh, medication, medication, medication
And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child  come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away leave today
Way up high in the sky, hey, whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooh
And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, hey whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
Only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooh
So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you, yeah
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, hey whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
Only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooh
Hey, oh
Oh the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show-ow-ow
Catch the wind, we're gonna see it spin
We're gonna sail, little girl
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh
My my my my my my my yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But does anybody know I'm gonna move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, Lord
Baby, baby, baby, oh, right now, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, come on, now
If it keeps on rainin'  levee's goin' to break
If it keeps on rainin'  levee's goin' to break
When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay.
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Lord  mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh  well  oh  well  oh  well.
Don't it make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home
You don't know which way to go?
If you're goin' down South
They go no work to do,
If you don't know about Chicago.
Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move.
All last night sat on the levee and moaned,
All last night sat on the levee and moaned,
Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home.
Going, go'n' to Chicago,
Go'n' to Chicago,
Sorry but I can't take you.
Going down, going down now, going down
going down now, going down, going down, going down, going down
Going down, going down now, going down
going down now, going down
going down now, going down
Going d-d-d-d-down
Woo woo
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again
So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate, if I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
My smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint
My own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
My love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know
You need cooling

Made up my mind to break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do want you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say 'cause I'm goin' away to stay
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart

Your time is gonna come
It was an April morning when they told us we should go
As I turn to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
Oh, the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again
Slipping off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh, to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh, to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah
Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
The shackles of commitment fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowds, yeah
To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path
That churns up into stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah
Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again
Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search?
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, oh
All of my love, all of my love, oh
All of my love to you
The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin, oh
All of my love, all of my love, oh
All of my love to you
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you 
Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind, oh
All of my love, all of my love, oh
All of my love to you
All of my love, ooh yes, all of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love, love, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, oh love

Babe, baby, baby,  I'm gonna leave you.

Come what may, every day
Oh, mama baby

It was really, really good.
You made me happy every single day.
But now!
I've got to go away!

Baby, baby, baby,
That's when it's callin' me
I said that's when it's callin' me back home.
There was a time I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy, woman, talkin' for hours and hours on the telephone
Then one day I set you up to walk right outta my life
Leavin' me all by myself, all alone, to cry every night
(Babe, babe, babe, babe, oh)
Oh, I want you to come back home, yeah
(Oh yeah)
Sweet little girl
(You been gone so long)
You've been away so long
Now listen to me
I said I made up my mind, woman when you left me there, oh
I was gonna find another sweet lover who's gonna feel all of my, all of my, all 
Of my cares
So I met a sweet little girl just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman but she turned around, and did the same thing 
Again to me, whoa

Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast 
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed 
But no one seemed to question in anyway
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
But no one there had heaven within their reach
Singing uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh 
Oh
Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow
Bow
Dull is the armour, cold is the day
Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way
I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day
Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip, throw down the key
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit, but guard the seed
They had to stay
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take off the fruit, but guard the seed
Take off the fruit, but guard the seed
Her face is cracked from smiling  
All the fears that she's been hiding  
And it seems that pretty soon, everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting  
Cheering winners who are losing  
And she worries if their days are few  and soon they'll have to go
My, my, my, I'm so happy  
I'm gonna join the band  
We  gonna dance and sing in celebration  
We are in the promised land 
She hears them talk of new ways 
To protect the home she lives in 
Then she wonders what it's all about when they break down the door. 
Her name is brown or white or black 
You know her very well, 
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell. 
My my my I'm so happy  
We gonna join the band  
We are gonna dance and sing in celebration  
We're in the promised land. 
Oh, there is a train that leaves the station 
Heading for your destination 
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more

Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows
I said it's alright, You know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only

Will your tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
Down by the seaside 
See the boats go sailin'
Can the people hear 
What the little fish are sayin'
Oh, oh, the people turned away 
Oh, the people turned away
Down in the city streets, 
See all the folk go racin', racin'
No time left, to pass the time of day
The people turned away

So far away, so far away

Do you still do the twist
Do you find you remember things that well
I want to tell you 
Some go twistin' every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell
Out in the country, 
Hear the people singin'
Singin' 'bout their progress 
Knowin' where they're goin'
Oh, oh, the people turned away
Yes, the people turned away
Sing loud for the sunshine 
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for lady nature 
And she will come back again
The people turned away
The people turned away
Oh, baby
Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for night
I hate to think I been blinded baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a burning
And the thrill of your touch give me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up and make it alright, yeah?
It's alright right
And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me baby
Whatever happened to you?
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true, hey
It ain't the first time believe me baby
I'm standing here feeling blue, blue ha!
Yes I'm blue
Oh, babe
Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around, 'round
And the clock on the wall's moving slower
Oh, my heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found, found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found
Hey, babe, ooh
Hand that ticks on the clock
Just don't seem to stop

Ooh now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet, oh

And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey!

Hey, now, oh, oh, oh

With my lemon in your hand 
Oh oh oh oh
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Oh oh oh oh
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around 
Oh
And she said, don't you want to?  
Don't you want to cook it, cook it, cook it? 
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah
Ooh, heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned 
Oh oh babe, damned 
In the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground  
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to, did not mean to fail 
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it 
You want to do it, you want to 
You want to do it when you want to 
You want to do it, do it when you want to 
When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right 
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama

Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah 
Sometime, baby
Nothin' I could do 
On the balance of a crystal 
Payin' through the nose 
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow
And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show 
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it (fryin') 
For your life 
For your life
Oh baby  it's cryin' time  
Oh baby  I got to fly
Got to try to find a way  
Got to try to get away  
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you babe 
Oh baby the river's red, ah baby in my head
There's a funny feelin' goin' on  
I don't think I can hold out long
And when the owls cry in the night  
Oh baby, baby when the pines begin to cry  
Baby, baby, baby  how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel? 
Craze, baby, the rainbow's end, mmm, baby, it's just a den 
For those who hide, who hide their love to depths of life 
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe
And when the owls cry in the night  
And baby when the pines begin to cry  
Oh baby, baby, how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel? 
Baby how do you feel?
Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
And they can't hold the wrath of those who walk
An' the boots of those who march

Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
"You got love, you ain't lonely"
Now she's gone and left me only, looking for what I knew
Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, just-
Met a man on the roadside crying,
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew.
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

Swingin' on the gallows pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king;
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.
La la la la
Side a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems
In the days of my youth
I was told what it was to be a man
Now I've reached the age
I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way to do the same old jam
Good times, bad times
You know I had my share
When my woman left home
With a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care
Sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as could be
Only took a couple of days
Till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine
And love me till the end
When I whispered in her ear
I lost another friend
Good times, bad times
You know I had my share
When my woman left home
With a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care
Good times, bad times
You know I had my share
When my woman left home
With a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part
When I done quit hollerin' baby

Gave my baby a twenty dollar bill,

Sure my shot, shot, shot-gun will, 
Yeah, I gave my baby a twenty dollar bill, 
If that don't get that woman, 
I'm sure my shot-gun will 
Gonna go shoot her now
Hey fellas have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town?
It won't take long just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face is the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes a different smile
Like that of one who knows
Well it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above
People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you, yeah
I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it
Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried
Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart

Sunday morning when we go down to church
See the menfolk standin' in line
I said they come to pray to the Lord
With my little girl, looks so fine
In the evening when the sun is sinkin' low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town, keep a-searchin' all around
Lookin' for my street corner girl
I got a woman, want to ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true
In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Gonna pack my bags and move on my way
'Cause I got a worried mind sharin' what I thought was mine
Gonna leave her where the guitars play
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah, yeah

(Oh, hot dog)
Well, I just got into town today 
To find my girl who's gone away 
She took the Greyhound at the general store 
I searched myself I searched the town 
When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 
She said we couldn't do no wrong 
No other love could be so strong 
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
Now she took my heart she took my keys 
From in my old blue dungarees 
And I'll never go to Texas anymore 
Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 
I took her love at seventeen 
A little late these days it seems 
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
I took her word I took it all 
Beneath the sign that said "you-haul" 
She left angels hangin' round for more 
Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 
I thought I had it all sewn up 
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
But folks said she was after something more 
I never did quite understand 
All that talk about rockin' bands 
But they just rolled my doll right out the door 
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted,
(And a) tear fell as I turned away
Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder,
Event I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me fuck all
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala
On the corner of Bleeker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver ran down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey
So I looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala
As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala
Oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise
Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala
Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe

There's an angel on my shoulder, in my hand a sword of gold 
Let me wander in your garden and the seeds of love I'll sow you know 
So the world is spinning faster are you dizzy when you're stoned 
Let the music be your master will you heed the master's call

I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinkin' it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh lord, well I did it again
Now I've got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven

Ah-ah, ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun, where the hot springs flow
The hammer of the gods
W'ell drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah-ah, ah!
Ah-ah, ah!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing

In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
But the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity, baby
She don't make no rules
Oh, I need your love

Oh, I need your love

So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness,
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy, baby
'Cause you can only blame yourself
Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Yeah, I need your love

When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot
Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh yeah, I need your love
I just got to have, I just got to have
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
And stars fill my dream
I'm a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
To sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
They talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed
Talk in song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
And not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, baby, I been blind
Oh, yeah, mama, there ain't no denyin'
Oh, ooh yes, I been blind
Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Try to find, try to find the way I feel
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like sorts inside a dream
Leave the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
Like Shangri-la beneath the summer moon
I will return again
As the dust that floats finds you
We're moving through Kashmir
Oh, father of the four winds fill my sails
Cross the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, when I want, when I'm on my way, yeah
And my feet wear my fickle way to stay
Ooh, yeah yeah, oh, yeah yeah,

Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down
Alimony, alimony payin' your bills

When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down
Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be

With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman (ah, I'm kidding man)
Nobody hears a single word you say
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
But you keep on talkin' till your dyin' day
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round

Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Walkin' in the park just the other day, baby
What do you  what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey  Boy  do you want to score?
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile
I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind.
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said
Please, hey, would we care to all get in line
Get in line
Well you know
They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, oh
Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin'
Ah, not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, oh.
If you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care
Don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly, oh, I really don't know
I received a message from my brother across the water 
He sat laughin' as he wrote the end's in sight 
So I said goodbye to all my friends 
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox 
'Cause I know it's time to fly 
Oh yeah, come on, meet me in the morning 
Meet me in the middle of the night 
Ah yeah, the morning light is comin' 
Don't it make you want to go and feel alright 
I just jumped a train that never stops 
So now somehow I'll know I never finished payin' for my ride 
Just n' someone pushed a gun into my hand 
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require 
Oh yeah, come on, meet me in the morning 
Want you meet me in the middle of the night 
The morning light is comin' 
Don't it make you want to go and feel alright

Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to th tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Everyone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams
I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems
I've found a paradise,
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one,
When other lovers are gone we'll live on,
We'll live on.

I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"
She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

I want a love that's right 
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl 
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now
I'm telling you
You know you pick me up 
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile 
Replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer 
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say 
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather 
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well she said she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well she said she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 9-0,
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 9-0,
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
I'm hoping everyday
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"
Can you feel when I'm holding you near
All the things that I do?
So, my love, am I making it clear?
One and one is two
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
From wanting you.
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything is alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote them like that

If you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
The just play it like that

And it doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
What words I pair
Or if my hair is brown
'Cause it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dull and out of key
You're correct
'Cause there's nobody there

And it's only there's no one there
(Penniman)

Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say "Hello"
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play,
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane!
Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse,
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt,
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat the bacon
Wait, oh yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
Wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, Mister Postman

(Whoah, yeah) Since I heard from that girl of mine
There must be some word today
From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I been standing here waiting, Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me
(Please, Mister Postman) Mister Postman look and see
(Oh, yeah) Is there a letter in your bag for me?
(Please, please, Mister Postman) I been waiting a long, long time
(Oh, yeah) Since I heard from that girl of mine
So many days you passed me by
See the tear standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter
Mister Postman, look and see
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
I been waiting a long, long time
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine

Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If the rain comes

And drink their lemonade.

When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.

Ready - set - go man go
I got a gal that I love so
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock 'n' roll
Goin' down to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye (chorus)
Well, the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are goin' wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style (chorus)
Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock 'n' roll 'til the early early night
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' there are all shook up
And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
No, rock and roll, this is how you do rock n' roll
Rockin' Ruby
Here's how you sing it
Well now I gotta girl now and Ruby is her name
Let's see I need some beat boys
Well this girl don't love me, but I love her just the same
Pick it up boys
Woah oh oh Ruby Ruby

Well now I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys

Aba zaba aba zaba zaba doo
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby baby
You always forget the words, every time
Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl
Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl

A coffee dessert, yes you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream, a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge, really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know, and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You shout aloud
You'll have to have them all pulled out

But can you show me, where you are?

It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play,
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show,
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go.
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday-yi-yay
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say-yi-yay
She says she loves you
and you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
and you know you should be glad
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
And now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind
She says she loves you
and you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
and you know you should be glad
Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her
Because she loves you
and you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
and you know you should be glad
Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
you know you should be glad
With a love like that
you know you should be glad
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She said
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
I said
Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel like I'm sad

She said you don't understand what I said
I said no no no you're wrong
When I was a boy, everything was right

Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
She(we gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (we gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years (bye bye)
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Daddy, our baby's gone.
"Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?"
She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years
Friday morning, at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the Motortrade
She (what did we do that was wrong)
Is Having (we didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside, that was always denied, for so many years
She's leaving home, bye, bye
I was slipping and sliding with a long tall Sally
Peeking and a hiding,duck back in the alley
Don't want to rip it up,don't want to dance with Annie
I've got a brand new lover name is Short Fat Fannie
One day while I was visiting at Heart Break Hotel
That's where I met Fannie and she sure looked swell
I told her that I loved her and I'd never leave
She put her arms around me, gave me fever
She's my tutti fruity,I love the child so
She watch me like a hound dog everywhere I go
Whenever I'm around her I'm on my p's and q's
She might step on my blue suede shoes
Well at a honky tonk party just the other night
Fannie got jealous and she started a fight
At the club I was dancing with Mary Lou
I had to call Jim Dandy to the rescue 
Short Fat Fannie she's my hearts desire
Short Fat Fannie sets my soul on fire
On Monday we were married on Blueberry Hill
Now we're so happy and I love her still

All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen. 
Sweet little sixteen, 
She's just got to have 
About half a million 
Framed autopraphs. 
Her wall is filled with pictures, 
She gets them one by one. 
Becomes so excited, 
Oh watch her at the run boy. 
Oh mommy mommy, 
Please may I go. 
You know it's such a sight to see 
Somebody steal the show. 
Oh daddy daddy, 
I beg of you. 
Please say it to mommy 
It's alright with you. 
Sweet little sixteen 
She's got the grown up blues. 
Tight dresses and lipstick, 
She's sporting in high heeled boots. 
Oh but tomorrow morning 
She'll have to change her trend 
Become sweet sixteen 
And back in class again.

My tears are fallin' cause you've taken her away
And through it really hurts me so
There's something that I gotta say 
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true I know she'd never be with you, so
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 
I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 
No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 
And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 
I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet.

Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me.
If you let me take your heart, I will prove to you
We will never be apart, if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me, I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realize now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm, trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm, trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see

Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said
You've got to go back
You know they didn't even give us a chance

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown call to say
You can make it O.K.
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said
Say what're you doing in bed
I said we're only trying to get us some peace

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul, think

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said
She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press
Said we wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Hey, Bungalow Bill

Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all-American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mommy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him".

Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round, oh oh oh, round round round round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round round round round, oh
For goodness sake

I never knew that a day 
Like today lay before us. 
I've got the sun in my heart 
And my heart's in the sun. 
Skies are as bright 
As your eyes, 
The horizon is open. 
Love is the ceiling, 
Feelings are reelings 
Free as the air. 
Forever on and forever, 
Forever on side by side. 
Who ever knew that we two 
Could be free as we'd fancy, 
Fancy is free 
But are we bound 
To each other by love, 
To each other by love? 
Who ever knew that we two

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels 
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of heaven

See all without looking
Do all without doing

That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door

Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before

Have you heard the word is love?

It's so fine, it's sunshine

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

You say you will love me
If I have to go

Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
The things we said today
You say you'll be mine, girl
'Til the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say

The things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck

To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do

Turn off your mind relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Running to and fro, 
Hard working at the mill, 
Never failed at the mill,

Salesman talking to me, 
Trying to run me up a creek, 
Says you can buy it, go on try it, 
You can pay me next week. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business 
For me to be involved again. 
Blonde hair, good-looking, 
Trying to get me hooked and married 
Get a home, settle down by the book. 
Too much monkey business,

Been to Yokohama, baby, 
Fighting in the war, 
Army bunk, army chow, 
Army clothes, army car.

Same thing every day, 
Getting up, going to school. 
No need for me complaining, 
My objection's overruled. 
Aw too much monkey business,

Working in the filling station, 
Too many tasks,

Get away and leave me.

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
Two of us Sunday driving
Not arriving

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

I need your love

God speed your love

Lonely rivers flow
To the sea
To the sea
To the open arms
Of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
"Wait for me, wait for me"
I'll be coming home
Wait for me

For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happenend which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk
There's a silence surrounding me
I can't seem to think straight
I'll sit in the corner
No one can bother me
I think I should speak now 
Why won't you talk to me
I can't seem to speak now 
You never talk to me
My words won't come out right 
What are you thinking
I feel like I'm drowning 
What are you feeling
I'm feeling weak now 
You never talk to me
But I can't show my weakness 
What are you thinking
I sometimes wonder 
What are you feeling
Where do we go from here
It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
Why won't you talk to me 
I feel like I'm drowning
You never talk to me 
You know I can't breathe now
What are you thinking 
We're going nowhere
What are you feeling 
We're going nowhere
Why won't you talk to me
You never talk to me
What are you thinking
Where do we go from here
It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
Into the distance a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses reeled
A fatal attraction is holding me fast how
How can I escape this irresistible grasp? 
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue tied and twisted just an earth bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air,
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
Far, far, far away, way

I will find a way, way

Then at last the mighty ship 
Descending on a point of flame 
Made contact with the human race 
And melted hearts 
Now, now, now is the time, time 
Time to be, be, be aware 
Carter's father saw him there and 
Knew the road revealed to him 
The living soul of 
Oh, my, something in my eye, eye 
Something in the sky, sky 
Waiting there for me 
The outer lock rolled slowly back 
The service men were heard to sigh 
For there revealed in glowing robes 
Was Lucy in the sky 
Oh, oh, did you ever know, know 
Never ever will they 
I cannot say 
Something in his cosmic art 
And glowing slightly from his toes

C'mon, baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified
Girl, you give me good feeling
I've been sanctified
Oh dear I, baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me just let your self go
Oh baby, let's get it on
I was spending my time in the doldrums
I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralyzed
I thought that everything else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night
To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
'Cause there'll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door
Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door
So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean?
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can't win
Lucifer Sam, Siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side
That cat's something I can't explain
Ginger, Ginger you're a witch
You're the left side
He's the right side
Oh, no
That cat's something I can't explain
Lucifer go to sea
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat
Somewhere, anywhere
That cat's something I can't explain
At night prowling sifting sand
Hiding around on the ground
He'll be found when you're around
That cat's something I can't explain
Leave when I ask you to leave, Lucy
Please fall away from me, Lucy
Oh, go, little girl
See that I'm so broken up about you, Lucy
Mean treatin' me and done me harm, Lucy
Been in love with you and your charms, Lucy
Oh, go, little girl
I'm in love with you, Lucy
You got my heart, you got my heart, oh no
You tear me apart, you just won't let me go
You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breathe
Now Lucy leave, Lucy
Leave when I ask you to leave, little girl
Please fall away from me, little girl
Yeah, go, little girl
See that I'm so broke up about you, Lucy
Yeah, girl
One thing I would like to point out, upon conclusion of the show this evening...
There was a king who ruled the land
His majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showers silver on the people
Oh mother, tell me more
Why'd'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They're scribbly black and everything (shines)
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did
For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high on
Clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh mother, tell me more
Tell me more
Money, get away
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team
Money, get back
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a Lear jet
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
Giving none away, away, away
Money, get away. 
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay.

"HuHuh! I was in the right!" 
"Yes, absolutely in the right!" 
"I certainly was in the right!" 
"You was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!" 
"Yeah!" 
"Why does anyone do anything?" 
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!" 
"I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number 2. He was asking 
why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and screaming 
and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely. It came as a heavy 
blow, but we sorted the matter out"
Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother do you think they'll like this song?
Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh, ah
Mother should I build the wall?
Mother should I run for President?
Mother should I trust the government?
Mother will they put me in the firing mine?
Ooh ah,
Is it just a waste of time?
Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry.
Mama's gonna make all your nightmares come true.
Mama's gonna put all her fears into you.
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing.
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing.
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm.
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby,
Of course mama's gonna help build the wall.
Mother do you think she's good enough?
For me?
Mother do you think she's dangerous,
To me?
Mother will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh ah,
Mother will she break my heart?
Hush now baby, baby don't you cry.
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you.
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through.
Mama's gonna wait up until you get in.
Mama will always find out where you've been.
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean.
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby,
You'll always be baby to me.
Mother, did it need to be so high?
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keepin' my shoes on
Got those swollen-hand blues
I got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through 
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I got nowhere to fly to
Ooh, babe when I pick up the phone
(Surprise, surprise, surprise) there's still nobody home
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
But I got fading roots
Fuck all that we've got to get on with these 
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese
There's too many home fires burning 
And not enough trees
So fuck all that 
We've go to get on with these
Can't stop!
Lose job! 
Mind gone!
Silicon! 
What bomb?
Get away! 
Pay day!
Make hay! 
Break down! 
Need fix. 
Big six. 
Clickity click. 
Hold on! 
Oh no, 
Bring bingo! 
Make 'em laugh 
Make 'em cry 
Make 'em dance in the aisles 
Make 'em pay 
Make 'em stay 
Make 'em feel okay 
Not nah John 
We've got to get on with the film show
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
Who cares what it's about 
As long as the kids go? 
Not now John we've
Got to get on with the show
Hang on John I've got to get on with this
I don't know what it is 
But it fits on here like
Come at the end of the shift
We'll go and get pissed
Not now John 
I've got to get on with this 
Hold on John 
I think there's something good on 
I used to read books but
It could be the news 
Or some other amusement
It could be reusable shows 
Fuck all that we've got to get on with these 
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
No need to worry about the Vietnamese
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees 
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear 
Maybe the Swedes
We showed Argentina 
Now let's go and show these
Make us feel tough 
And wouldn't Maggie be pleased? 
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah! 
S'cusi dove il bar

Oh! Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day 
Down! 
Go, Maggie! 
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, now!

(Instrumental)
A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
I will, I will she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight
Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you will never forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight
"Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?
"I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you"
"This place is bigger than our apartment"
"Let me know when you're entering a room"
"Yes sir"
"Um, Can I get a drink of water?"
"I was wondering about"
"You want some, huh?"
"Yes"
"Oh wow, look at this tub? Do you want to take bath?"
"I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for her main"
"What are watching?"
"If you'll just let me know as soon as you can Mrs Bancroft" "Mrs Bancroft"
"Hello?"
"I don't understand"
"Are you feeling okay?"
Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin of a dying man
And night after night, we pretend its all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder and
Nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favorite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch T.V.?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would'ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
All alone, or in two's
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists
Make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall
Isn't this where
Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
A drink, a drink, a drink, a drink
What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget
The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do, I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be
Be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget
Button your lip. Don't let the shield slip. 
Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask. 
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions 
You can hide, hide, hide, 
"I'll tell you what, I'll give you three blacks, and play you for five" 
"Ta! You was unlucky there son" 
"Time gentleman!" 
Behind paranoid eyes. 
You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar. 
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar, 
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world 
With the boys in the crowd 
You hide, hide, hide, 
Behind petrified eyes. 
You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory. 
Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age 
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high. 
And you hide, hide, hide, 
Behind brown and mild eyes.
Big man, pig man
Ha, ha, charade you are
You well heeled big wheel
Ha, ha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Saying 'Keep on digging'
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry
Bus stop rat bag
Ha, ha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Ha, ha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a hand gun
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry
Hey you, Whitehouse
Ha, ha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Ha, ha, charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
You got to stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside
Mary you're nearly a treat
Mary you're nearly a treat
But you're really a cry
If you didn't care
What happened to me
And I didn't care for you

We would zig-zag our way
Through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain

Wondering which of the
Buggers to blame
And watching the pigs on the wing
Hey Eugene
This is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say
That I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me
And hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange
How little we change
Isn't it sad we're insane
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands 
Jumps into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried
This is my last goodbye
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in (breathe in, breathe in, breathe in)
People pushing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags
It's goodbye
Hey Jean look at the screen and it's goodbye
Julian hey, the milky way and it's goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
I am going to say goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, goodbye
Did you know, it was all going to go so wrong for you
And did you see it was all going to be so right for me
Why did we tell you then
You were always the golden boy then
And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes
Hey you, did you ever realize what you'd become
And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes
The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know
I never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes

Remember a day before today 
A day when you were young. 
Free to play alone with time 
Evening never comes. 
Sing a song that can't be sung 
Without the morning's kiss 
Queen, you shall be it if you wish 
Look for your king 
Why can't we play today 
Why can't we stay that way 
Climb your favorite apple tree 
Try to catch the sun 
Hide from your little brother's gun 
Dream yourself away 
Why can't we reach the sun 
Why can't we blow the years away 
Blow away 
Blow away 
Remember 
Remember
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
You better make your face up in
Your favorite disguise
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
When the conch shell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down your door
You'd better run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
You better run all day
And run all night
Keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend
Out tonight
You'd better park the car
Well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
You better run
"Hey, open up!"
"Hammer, hammer"
As I reach for a peach
Slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez
Breakin' a stick
With a brick on the sand
Ridin' a wave
In the wake of an old sedan
Sleepin' alone in the
Drone of the darkness,
Scratched by the sand that
Fell from my love,
Deep in my dreams and I
Still hear her callin'
If you're alone
I'll come home
Backward and home-bound
The pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind
And the rain, on an airplane
Owning a home
With no silver spoon
I'm drinking champagne
Like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for
A break in the weather,
I'll gather my far-flung
Thoughts together
Speeding away
On the wind to a new day
And if you're alone
I'll come home
And I pause for a while
By a country style
And listen to the things they say
Diggin' for gold
With a hoe in my hand
Open a book
Take a look at the way things stand
And you're leading me down
To the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice
Calling to me
Making a date for
Later by phone
And if you're alone
I'll come home
I was in the kitchen,
Seamus, that's the dog, was outside
Well, I was in the kitchen,
Seamus, my old hound, was outside
Well, the sun sinks slowly
But my old hound just sat right down and cried
Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow
There is no other day

Soon after dark Emily cries, ah ooh
Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow
There is no other day

Put on a gown that touches the ground, ah ooh
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily (Emily)

Little by little the night turns around. 
Counting the leaves which tremble and turn. 
Lotus's lean on each other in union. 
Over the hills where a swallow is resting. 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.
Over the mountain watching the watcher. 
Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine. 
Morning to birth is born into shadow 
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine. 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun. 
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun. 
Who is the man who arrives at the wall? 
Making the shape of his questions at asking. 
Thinking the sun will fall in the evening. 
Will he remember the lesson of giving? 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun. 
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.
Aye an' a bit of mackerel, settler rack and down
Ran it down by the home, and I flew
Well, it slapped me and I flopped it down in the shade
And I cried, cried, cried
The tear had fallen down he had taken, never back to raise
And then cried Mary, and took out wi' your Claymore
Right outta a' pocket, I ran down, down by the mountain side
Battlin' the fiery horde that was falling around the feet
"Never!," he cried, "Never shall ye get me alive
Ye rotten hound of the burnie crew!"
Well I snatched fer the blade and a Claymore cut and thrust
And I fell down before him round his feet
Aye, a roar he cried fray the bottom of 'is heart
That I would nay fall but as dead
Dead as I can by why' feet, d'ya ken?
And the wind cried back
Hopelessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem
What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise
The look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives he releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water
Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers 
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream
Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old
Remember when you were young? 
You shone like the sun. 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Now there's a look in your eyes 
Like black holes in the sky 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
You were caught in the crossfire 
Of childhood and stardom, 
Blown on the steel breeze 
Come on you target 
for faraway laughter; 
Come on you stranger, you legend, 
You martyr, and shine 
You reached for the secret 
too soon 
You cried for the moon 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Threatened by shadows at night 
And exposed in the light 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Well, you wore out your welcome 
With random precision 
Rode on the steel breeze 
Come on you raver, you seer of visions; 
Come on you painter, you piper, 
You prisoner, and shine 
Nobody knows where you are, 
How near or how far 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Pile on many 
more layers 
And I'll be joining you there 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
And we'll bask in the shadow 
Of yesterday's triumph 
And sail on the steel breeze 
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser, 
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, 
And shine.
When the child like view of the world went, nothing replaced it...nothing replaced it...nothing replaced it... 
I do not like being asked to.....I do not like being asked to... I do not like being asked to....
Other people replaced it
Someone who knows

Lady divine, I hear on the grapevine
Gabriel came to the stable last night
Lady divine, I hear on the grapevine
Gabriel came to the stable last night
They disembarked in 45 
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled 
There were to many spaces in the line. 
Gathered at the cenotaph 
All agreed with the hand on heart 
To sheath the sacrificial Knifes. 
But now 
She stands upon Southampton dock 
With her handkerchief 
And her summer frock clings 
To her wet body in the rain. 
In quiet desperation knuckles 
White upon the slippery reins 
She bravely waves the boys Goodbye again. 
And still the dark stain spreads between 
His shoulder blades. 
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves. 
And when the fight was over 
We spent what they had made. 
But in the bottom of our hearts 
We felt the final cut.
I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years
Been over the edge for yonks
Been working me buns off for bands 
I've always been mad, I know I've been mad
Like the most of us, very hard to explain why you're mad
Even if you're not mad
I want to go home
Take off this uniform and leave the show 
And I'm waiting in this cell because I have to know 
Have I been guilty all this time?
Would you like to say something before you leave
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We said goodbye before we said hello
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year
And I would like to know
How do you feel, how do you feel?
How do you feel, how do you feel?
Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need
I felt the cold far too soon, in a room of 95
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town and another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man
Just you let me know
How do you feel, how do you feel?
How do you feel, how do you feel?
Goodbye to you
Charlotte Pringle's due
I've had enough for one day
Doctor doctor!
I'm in bed
Achin' head
Gold is lead
Choke on bread
Underfed
Gold is lead
Jesus bled
Pain is red
Are goon
Grow go
Greasy spoon
You swoon
June bloom

Music seems to help the pain
Seems to cultivate the brain
Doctor kindly tell your wife that
I'm alive, flowers thrive, realize, realize
Realize
Speech has allowed the communication of ideas
Enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible
Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking
Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future
With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded

All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather 'round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know the web we weave
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world, one world
Invisible transfers, long distance calls,
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world, one world
The dogs of war don't negotiate
The dogs of war won't capitulate,
They will take and you will give,
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door,
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain.
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world, one world
Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes 
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time 
And far from flying high in clear blue skies 
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide 
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive 
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes 
And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall 
Dial the combination, open the priest hole 
And if I'm in I'll tell you (what's behind the wall)
There's a kid who had a big hallucination 
Making love to girls in magazines 
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith 
Could anybody love him 
Or is it just a crazy dream? 
And if I show you my dark side 
Will you still hold me tonight? 
And if I open my heart to you 
And show you my weak side 
What would you do? 
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone? 
Would you take the children away 
And leave me alone? 
And smile in reassurance 
As you whisper down the phone? 
Would you send me packing? 
Or would you take me home? 
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands 
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang 
I never had the nerve to make the final cut
Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere 
And build them a home, a little place of their own. 
The Fletcher Memorial 
Home for Incurable Tyrants and Kings. 
And they can appear to themselves every day 
On closed circuit T.V. 
To make sure they're still real. 
It's the only connection they feel. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Reagan and Haig, 
Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher, and Paisly, 
"Hello Maggie!" 
Mr. Brezhnev and party. 
"Who's the bald chap?" 
The ghost of McCarthy, 
The memories of Nixon. 
"Good-bye!" 
And now, adding color, a group of anonymous latin- 
American Meat packing glitterati. 
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect? 
They can polish their medals and sharpen their 
Smiles, and amuse themselves playing games for awhile. 
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead. 
Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye 
With their favorite toys 
They'll be good girls and boys 
In the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial 
Wasters of life and limb. 
Is everyone in? 
Are you having a nice time? 
Now the final solution can be applied.
I want to tell you a story
About a little man
If I can
A gnome named Grimble Crumble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine
He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue green hood
It looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass
Fresh air at last
Wining, dining, biding his time
And then one day, hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooomray
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go
And then one day, hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooomray
Ooomray
Come on, my friends,
Let's make for the hills.
They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills.
You can get your hands on whatever we find,
Because I'm only coming along for the ride.
Well, you go your way,
I'll go mine.
I don't care if we get there on time.
Everybody's searching for something, they say.
I'll get my kicks on the way.
Over the mountains, across the seas
Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names.
Faces of people and places don't change.
All I have to do is just close my eyes
To see the seagulls wheeling on those far distant skies.
All I want to tell you, all I want to say 
Is count me in on the journey.
Don't expect me to stay.
Floating down
Through the clouds
Memories come rushing up to meet me now
But in the space between the heavens
And in the corner of some foreign field
I had a dream
I had a dream
Goodbye Max
Goodbye Ma
After the service
When you're walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold november air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream
A place to stay
[Bloke:] "Oi! A real one..."
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what's more
No-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue
Kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no-one kills the children anymore
No-one kills the children anymore
Night after night
Going round and round my brain
His dream is driving me insane
In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight
What's done is done
We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream
Take heed
You! Yes, you! Stand still laddy
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children any way they could
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives
Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about? 
Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape. 
When I was their age all the lights went out. 
There was no time to whine or mope about. 
And even now part of me flies over 
Dresden at angels one five. 
Though they'll never fathom it begind my 
Sarcasm desperate memories lie. 
Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good. 
Cause that's the only time that I can really speak to you. 
And there is something that I've locked away 
A memory that is too painful 
To withstand the light of day. 
When we came back from the war the banners and 
Flags hung on everyone's door. 
We danced and we sang in the street and 
The church bells rang. 
But burning in my heart 
My memory smolders on 
Of the gunners dying words on the intercom.
Following the path as it leads toward
The darkness in the north
Weary stranger's faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way
Mystery swelling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar Jer louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all you fears
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning and you know
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way
Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come when the match 
For me the curlers past warning
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way
I was standing by the Nile 
When I saw the lady smile 
I would take her out for a while 
For a while
Oh, my tears wept like a child 
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly
Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases 
She will make it to the islands in the sun
I will follow in her shadow 
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye
She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep 
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down
Tell me true tell me why was Jesus crucified
Is it for this that daddy died?
Was it for you? was it me?
Did I watch too much t.v.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?
If it wasn't for the nips
Being so good at building ships
The yards would still be open on the clyde
And it can't be much fun for them
Beneath the rising sun
With all their kids committing suicide
What have we done maggie what have we done
What have we done to England
Should we shout should we scream
"What happened to the post war dream?"
Oh Maggie Maggie what have we do?
The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
He didn't care
He stood in a field where barley grows
His head did no thinking
His arms didn't move except when the wind cut up
Rough and mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he's resigned to his fate
'Cause life's not unkind, he doesn't mind
He stood in a field where barley grows
(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) must the show go on?
(Ooh, pa) take me home, take me home, take me home
(Ooh, ma) let me go
There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old, is it too late?
(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) where has the feeling gone?
(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) will I remember the songs?
(Ooh, ah)
The show must go on
Momma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooh baby
Ooh baby blue
Ooh babe
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice
Good morning, Worm your honor
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honor
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today?
Crazy
Toys in the attic, I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away
Crazy, toys in the attic he is crazy
You little shit you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often
Than you did, but no
You had to go
Your own way, have you broken any
Homes up lately?
Just five minutes, worm your honor
Him and me, alone
Babe
Come to mother baby, let me hold you
In my arms
M'lud I never wanted him to
Get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honor, let me take him home
Crazy
Over the rainbow, I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy
The evidence before the court is
Incontrovertible, there's no need for
The jury to retire
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving
Of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
Since, my friend, you have revealed your
Deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before
Your peers
Tear down the wall
We certainly an unspoken understanding
Ah but there's a lot of things unsaid as well
We shout and argue and fight, and work it on out
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. 
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. 
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. 
So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 
Racing around to come up behind you again. 
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, 
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. 
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time. 
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines 
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way 
The time is gone, the song is over, 
Thought I'd something more to say.
In my rear view mirror the sun is going down 
Sinking behind bridges in the road 
And I think of all the good things 
That we have left undone 
And I suffer premonitions 
Confirm suspicions 
Of the holocaust to come. 
The wire that holds the cork 
That keeps the anger in 
Gives way 
And suddenly it's day again. 
The sun is in the east 
Even though the day is done. 
Two suns in the sunset 
Hmm
Could be the human race is run. 
Like the moment when the brakes lock 
And you slide towards the big truck 
"Oh no!" 
"Daddy, Daddy!" 
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear. 
And you'll never hear their voices 
And you'll never see their faces 
You have no recourse to the law anymore. 
And as the windshield melts 
My tears evaporate 
Leaving only charcoal to defend. 
Finally I understand the feelings of the few. 
Ashes and diamonds 
Foe and friend 
We were all equal in the end. 
"And now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers 
Spreading from the east with an expected high of 4000 degrees 
Celsius"
Us (us, us, us, us) and them (them, them, them, them)
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me
And you (you, you, you)
God only knows
It's not what we would choose (choose, choose) to do (to do, to do)
Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map
Moved from side to side
Black (black, black, black)
And blue (blue, blue)
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up (up, up, up, up)
And down (down, down, down, down)
And in the end it's only round 'n round (round, round, round)
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside
"I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again. Dig it?
I mean he get off lightly, 'cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion, but really
I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?"
Down (down, down, down, down)
And out (out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped that there's a lot of it about
With (with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died
In yellow shoes I get the blues
Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man how are you?
So I've changed my dear, and I find my knees,
And I covered them up with the latest cut,
And my pants and socks all point in a box,
They don't make long of my nylon socks,
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole,
And all the lot is what I got,
It's what I wear, it's what you see,
It must be me, it's what I am,
Vegetable man
I've been looking all over the place for a place for me,
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere
Vegetable man, vegetable man,
He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can,
Vegetable man
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day?
Vera, Vera
What has become of you
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do?
Eins, zwei, drei, alle
Ooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
We're waiting to succeed and going to convene outside Brixton
Town Hall where we're going to be
Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers
And fire the ovens
Waiting for the queens and the coons
And the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our colored cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms
The worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station
From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Didn't recognize what I'd become
No more than alive I'd barely survive
In a word, overrun
Won't hear a sound
From my mouth
I've spent too long
On the inside out
My skin is cold
To the human touch
This bleeding heart's
Not beating much
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don't even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile
I'm creeping back to life
My nervous system all away
I'm wearing the inside out
Look at him now
He's paler somehow
But he's coming round
He's starting to choke
It's been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth
And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again
I'm holding out
For the day
When all the clouds
Have blown away
I'm with you now
Can speak your name
Now we can hear
Ourselves again
He's curled into the corner
But still the screen is flickering
With an endless stream of garbage to
Curse the place
In a sea of random images
The self-destructing animal
Waiting for the waves to break
He's standing on the threshold
Caught in fiery anger
And hurled into the furnace he'll
Curse the place
He's torn in all directions
And the screen is still flickering
Waiting for the flames to break
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'scouting for boys'
You brought a guitar to punish your ma
And you didn't like school, and you
Know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine
As you look around this room tonight 
Settle in your seat and dim the lights 
Do you want my blood  do you want my tears 
What do you want 
What do you want from me 
Should I sing until I can't sing any more 
Play these strings until my fingers are raw 
You're so hard to please 
What do you want from me 
Do you think I know something you don't know 
What do you want from me 
If I don't promise you the answers would you go 
What do you want from me 
Should I stand out in the rain 
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you 
I'm not the one you need 
What do you want from me 
You can have anything you want 
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water 
Anything you want
You can own everything you see 
Sell your soul for complete control 
Is that really what you need 
You can lose yourself this night 
See inside there is nothing to hide 
Turn and face the light 
What do you want from me
What shall we use to fill the empty spaces
Where waves of hunger roar?
Shall we set out across the sea of faces
In search of more and more applause?
Shall we buy a new guitar?
Shall we drive a more powerful car?
Shall we work straight through the night?
Shall we get into fights?
Leave the lights on?
Drop bombs?
Do tours of the east?
contract diseases?
Bury bones?
Break up homes?
Send flowers by phone?
Take to drink?
Go to shrinks?
Give up meat?
Rarely sleep?
Keep people as pets?
Train dogs?
Race rats?
Fill the attic with cash?
Bury treasure?
Store up leisure?
But never relax at all
With our backs to the wall
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, eheh
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, oh oh oh
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on
What's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Ah, what's going on
In the mean time
Right on, baby
Right on brother
Right on babe
Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply 'cause our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh oh oh
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
C'mon talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's going on, ooh ooo ooo ooo
Right on baby
Right on baby
It was just before dawn
One miserable morning in black 'forty four
When the forward commander
Was told to sit tight
When he asked that his men be withdrawn
And the Generals gave thanks
As the other ranks held back
The enemy tanks for a while
And the Anzio bridgehead
Was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives
And kind old King George
Sent mother a note
When he heard that father was gone
It was, I recall
In the form of a scroll
With gold leaf adorned
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed
With his own rubber stamp
It was dark all around
There was frost in the ground
When the tigers broke free
And no one survived
From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z
They were all left behind
Most of them dead
The rest of them dying
And that's how the High Command
Took my daddy from me
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here
Heaven sent the promised land
Looks alright from where I stand
'Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it's time
To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old
Flash the readies
What's, uh the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel
Mile after mile (mile after mile)
Stone after stone (stone after stone)
you turn to speak but you're alone
Million miles from home, you're on your own
So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old
Fire bright by candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers we will never stir again
Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out
Hear me shout "Come on in,
What's the news and where you been?"
'Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old
One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed
The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best
And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse,
A pointless life has run its course,
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun
You're going on that plane to take you where you belong.
But no, I have
You have got to listen to me. 
Do you have any idea what you have to look forward to if you stay here? 
Nine chances out of ten we both end up in a concentration camp and that
You're only saying these things to make me go.
I'm saying it 'cause it's true. Inside us, we both know we belong in different
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
But what about us?
But what about us?
I am just a new boy
Stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Ooh, baby set me free
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
Hello?
Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mister Floyd
Will you accept the charges from United States?
Oh, he hung up, that's your residence, right? I wonder why he hung up?
Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?
Hello?
This is United States calling, are we reaching
See he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering
They flutter behind you your possible pasts
Some brightened and crazy some frightened and lost
A warning to anyone still in command
Of their possible future to take care
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time
Do you remember me? how we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
She stood in the doorway the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs
For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs
Stepping uo boldly one put out his hand
He said, " I was just a child then now I'm only a man"
Do you remember me? how we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad
Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray
Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay
And strung out behind us the banners and flags
Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags
Do you remember me? how we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
I try to put my arms around you
All because I want to hold you tight
(To hold you tight)
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight
(Out of sight)
Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
I'm gonna love you
(Gonna love you in every way)
In every way
(Gonna love you in every way)
I'm gonna love you
(Gonna love you in every way)
In every way
(Gonna love you in every way)
With other girls I've wanted
I've made it just a moment
With you I'll share each day
(I'll stay by your side)
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain
(Don't you listen to that jive)
Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you
[Repeat... Fade]
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime
Feels like more than a lifetime
Sometimes I get tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way it has always been?
Could it ever have been different?
Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever,
Nobody lives forever
Pass the tequila, Manuel
(glug, snort)
Listen, gringo, laugh at my lisp and I kill you
I think
This Spanish music 
It sets my soul on fire 
Lovely seniorita 
Your eyes are like stars 
Your teeth are like pearls 
Your ruby lips
Listen baby, ain't no mountain high, 
Ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough; 
Baby if you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name;  I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on, I made a vow,
I'll be there when you want me,
Some way, some how.
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand,
I'll be there on the double
As fast as I can.
Don't you know that there
 
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
No wind no rain or winters cold can stop me baby,
'Cause you are my goal.
If you're ever in trouble;
I'll be there on the double.
Just send for me, oh baby.
 
If you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again
So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate, if I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
My smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint
My own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
My love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?
Dad, what you leave behind for me?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town 
Feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people
She's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye
Then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
I love, she
She loves me
See you
See you
See you
Thought you might like to know
I'm the lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the river side
Feeding ducks by the afternoon tide
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Arnold Layne 
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine
On the wall 
Hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He done it, oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, 
It takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne
Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang 
He hates it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same 
It takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne, don't do it again
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
Now fights between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten
Blinding signs flap,
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam, pow, pow
Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters underground
"There is an Important announcement"
"Silence in the studio!"
Wasting my time, 
Resting my mind 
And I'll never pine 
For the sad days and the bad days 
When we was workin' from nine to five. 
And if you don't mind 
I'll spend my time 
Here by the fire side 
In the warm light and the love in her eyes. 
And if you don't mind 
I'll spend my time 
Here by the fire side 
In the warm light of her eyes
I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like

I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork

Let's go into the other room and make them work.
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around, choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all your touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave
Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home
Wrong, do it again
Time to go
Are you feeling okay?
There's a man answering, but he keeps hanging up
Is there anybody out there?
Bridges burning gladly 
Merging with the shadows
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Borne on wings of fire and climbing higher
Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way 
Magic visions stirring
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eye 
The doorway stands ajar
The walls that once were high 
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band
Oh, my girl sitting in the sky
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run
Lay back

Don't talk to me
Please, just fuck with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon

Don't touch me child
Please, know you drive me wild
Please you know, I'm feeling frail

Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very, very, very frail

Oh, my girl sitting in the sun
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run
Like that

You shout in your sleep.
Perhaps the price is just too steep.
Is your conscience at rest 
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start 
To just the beating of your heart.
Just one man beneath the sky,
Just two ears, just two eyes.
You set sail across the sea 
Of long past thoughts and memories.
Childhood's end, your fantasies 
Merge with harsh realities.
And then as the sail is hoist,
You find your eyes are growing moist.
All the fears never voiced 
Say you have to make your final choice.
Who are you and who am I 
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die 
Beneath one infinite sky.
There'll be war, there'll be peace.
But everything one day will cease.
All the iron turned to rust;
All the proud men turned to dust.
And so all things, time will mend.
So this song will end.
In a churchyard by a river 
Lazing in the haze of midday 
Laughing in the grasses and the graze
Yellow bird, you are not long
In singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving
Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters 
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds
On a trip to Cirrus Minor 
Saw a crater in the sun 
A thousand miles of moonlight later
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship  smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb
Where were you when I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by from my window watching
And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
'Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
Headed straight into the shining sun
Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg 
He won it in the war, in 1944
Corporal Clegg had a medal too 
In orange, red, and blue 
He found it in the zoo
Dear, dear, were they really sad for me? 
Dear, dear, will they really laugh at me? 
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin
Corporal Clegg, umbrella in the rain 
He's never been the same 
No one is to blame 
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream 
From Her Majesty the queen 
His boots were very clean
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him 
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin
He made his way to the border
In the shadow under the trees
Down by a stream in a hollow
Turn your head feel the breeze
And the red Queen was waiting for the news
For the white King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight
They let him in by a back way
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read
Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round
Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn color
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right
There will be no game today, she cried across the board
Everyday will be a holiday
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad
And the Pink Queen sat
And smiled at the cat who smiled back.
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Ah down beside that red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls

And the voice is so clear, time after time it keeps on
Calling you, calling you on

But you'll write it out again before you die (yeah yeah)
A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will - but the air you breathe I live to give you
Father to son, father to, father to, father to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around

I think I'm going back 
To the things I learnt so well in my youth 
I think I'm returning to 
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth 
Now, there are no games 
To only pass the time 
No more colouring books 
No Christmas bells to chime 
But thinking young and growing older is no sin 
And I can't play the game of life to win 
I can recall a time 
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend 
And, now, I think I've got 
A lot more than just my toys to lend 
Now there's more to do 
Than watch my sailboat glide 
And every day can be 
My magic carpet ride 
And I can play hide and seek with my fears 
And live my days instead of counting my years 
Then everyone debates 
The true reality 
I'd rather see the world 
The way it used to be 
A little bit of freedom's all we lack 
So catch me if you can 
I'm going back
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come get up my baby
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
Come get up my baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
Come get up my baby
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day, I believe oh Lord
I believe all the way
Come get up my baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop 
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and baby B.
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company
Oo hoo oo hoo
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J.
The girl from number four
Very soon I begged her won't you keep me company
Oo hoo oo hoo
Oo hoo oo hoo
Oo hoo oo hoo
Come marry me for evermore we'll be good company
Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappeared
But we're safe enough behind our door
I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own
Limited company
I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company
I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your Valentino just for you
Ooh love ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy
Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh ooh can you feel my love heat, ooh
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after-all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command
Ooh love ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Write my letter
Feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone
When I'm not with you
I think of you always
(I miss those long hot summer nights) I miss you
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, love you
Hey boy where do you get it from
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion in the good old fashioned school of loverboys
Dining at the Ritz, we'll meet at nine precisely
(One two three four five six seven eight nine o' clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (come on and get it)
Ooh love, (there he goes again just like a good old-fashioned lover boy)
Ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Everything's all right
Just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned fashioned lover boy
Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May

Always wanted by the law

Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see ?
Hit it
Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word - not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
Sure, the great lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realise tomorrow, oh woh oh woh oh woh
No I'm not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
Hear it
No
Wouldn't you like to know ?
Wouldn't you like to know ?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see ?

'Til one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall
Rich or poor or famous 
For your truth it's all the same
(Oh no, oh no)
Oh, lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
(Oh no)
Hey yeah, baby, now your struggle's all in vain, yeah
For who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder
What the hell are we fighting for?
Ah, just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers

I said Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou
I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou
We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"
You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
I swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did see you before
I said Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou
I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou
We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What'd you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the way I always dreamed it would be 
The way that it is, o-oh,when you are holding me 
I never had a love of my own 
Maybe that's why when we're all alone 
I can hear music 
I can hear music 
Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear 
Oh well I can hear music 
Sweet sweet music 
Whenever you touch me baby 
Whenever you're near 
Loving you it keeps me satisfied 
And I can't explain,oh no,the way I'm feeling inside 
You look at me we kiss and then 
I close my eyes and here it comes again 
I can hear music 
I can hear music 
Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear 
Oh well I can hear music 
Sweet sweet music 
Whenever you touch me baby 
Whenever you're near 
I can hear music 
Sweet sweet music 
Whenever you touch me baby 
Whenever you're near 
I can hear music 
Sweet sweet music 
Whenever you touch me baby 
Whenever you're near
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you
Yeah I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I traveled a long road to get hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you, yeah
But I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do, yeah
I can't live with you I can't live with you
I can't live I can't live
I can't I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah and I can't live without you
Through the madness through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years, yeah
Ooh yeah
Yeah, I can't live without you, yeah yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Oh oh, I can't live without you, baby baby baby
Without you
I can't live without you
I took my baby dancing, to see a heavy band
But I never saw my baby till the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't want to cry 'cause I had to be cool
I didn't want to tell you that you're much too cruel
Did you have to run off with that doggone fool?
[Chorus]
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby
I wouldn't mind the postman if the neighbors didn't know
Or the gas man, electric man, man to fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock 'n roll clone
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?
Go ahead, fool
[Chorus]
So I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more
I don't want to go and see Queen no more, no more
I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more
I don't want to go and see Queen no more, no more
Now, I don't want to hurt you like you been a-hurting me
But you know I'll be watchin' 
Rolling on the floor next time you're on TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoiled brat
To think I nearly let you get away with all that
No way, man
[Chorus]
Oh, you'd better stay away from me, baby
Baby, baby, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say
Gotta find me a future move out of my way
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
But just give me, huh, what I know is mine
People do you hear me, just gimme the sign

And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all
Oh oh yeah yeah ha ha ha ha ha

When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you, oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, ooh woh
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear 
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad (I'm going slightly mad)
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, uh huh
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear
Uh uh ah ah
Uh uh ah ah
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unraveling fast it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear, how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened, oh yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad
And there you have it
Oh
The machine of a dream, such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
With my hand on your grease gun
Mmm, it's like a disease, son
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal
Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks saying this is the end, now
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive
I'm in love with my car (love with my car), gotta feel for my automobile
I'm in love with my car (love with my car), string back gloves in my automolove
Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely
Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ooh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said
Give as good as you get
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself
Come on
Get up
You're feelin' good
Keep your fingers off my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around
Invite me to your little contract Ha! Ha!
Rumor has it that you could play dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah!
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
It's everyone for themselves
Move on out
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Monday the start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away ooh
Tuesday I saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me
Wednesday I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name
I never thought that this could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade
I wish Friday would last for ever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there
Saturday just twenty four hours
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday
Ooh so sad alone
Aaah, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts with you, and only you
Anything you ask I do, for you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end
I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
What more can I do ?
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I leave it to you
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I want you to, aah
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods, aah
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods, aah
Lap of the Gods, aah
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
One two three four
Ooh ooh
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
Yeah
Just passing our time
Oh oh
While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons and on and on
Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying, yeah
We'll tread that fine line
Oh oh we'll keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Through the sorrow all through our splendor
Don't take offence at my innuendo
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego be free, be free to yourself
Oh oh, yeah
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
Ha, if there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself destroy our fears release your mask
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
(Yeah) yeah
We'll keep on smiling, yeah
(Yeah) (yeah) (yeah)
And whatever will be will be
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle
Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today
The world that we created
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Wooh, is this the world we created?
We made it all our own
Is this the world we devastated, right to the bone
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that he created
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no-one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Woh - how I could love you
If I could let you stay
It's late - and I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late - It's late - It's late
But not too late
Mmm, yeah
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down, yes
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through
It's late - mmm, and it's driving me so mad
It's late - yes I know, but don't try and tell me that it's
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the light
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late - It's late - It's late
But not too late
Mm, I've been so long
You've been so long
We've been so long tryin' to work it out
I ain't got long
You ain't got long
We've gotta know what this life's all about, ooh
Tell me
Tryin' to work it out, yeah, ooh
Ooh too late, yeah, too late, much too late, aaah
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?
It's late - ooh, but it's time to set me free
It's late - ooh, yes I know, but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late - let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late - It's late - It's late - It's late
It's late - It's late - It's late
Oh, It's all too late
Woah, woah, c'mon
Ooh m m m m late too late oh yeah
Waaa
It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining
I feel good
And no-one's gonna stop me now, oh yeah
It's a beautiful day
I feel good, I feel right
And no-one, no-one's gonna stop me now
Mama
Sometimes I feel so sad, so sad, so bad
But no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one
It's hopeless, so hopeless to even try
The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumpin'
And the hub caps all gleam
When I'm holdin' your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
Oh it's like a disease son
I'm in love with my car
Gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar

The warden threw a party in the county jail.
The prison band was there and they began to wail.
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.
[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone,
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,
the whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.
[Chorus]
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
I sure would be delighted with your company,
come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."
[Chorus]
The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
way over in the corner weepin' all alone.
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square.
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair."
[Chorus]
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake,
no one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break."
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix,
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."
[Chorus]
Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love
Was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love to see?
Oh jealousy look at me now
Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous guy
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not
If I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy
And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered round Him
The beggars shouted the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about him
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
Then came a man before His feet he fell
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now go now you're a new man instead
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men

I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile

Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day

You might believe in heaven

For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

When the machines take over

They squeeze me they stress me
With smoke blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no one but no one but no one can wrest me away

Don't you misfire; fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you misfire; fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Your gun is loaded
And pointing my way
There's only one bullet
So don't delay
Got to time it right
Fire me through the night
Come on take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire
Misfire
Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and That's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall
Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the jukebox blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin'
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll
Get you high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Gonna know just who you are
Look out
Modern times rock and roll
If you're feelin' tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you're thinkin' how the days seem long
All you're given
Is what you've been given
A thousand times before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz
Only football gives us thrills
Rock 'n' roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs get on your feet
Lay on the floor
Can't help thinkin' I've heard that line before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz
Oh no matter
Fool got no business hanging round and tellin' lies
Bicycle races are coming your way
If you can't beat 'em join them
Fun it
Oh you're gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
No more, no more, no more
Of that jazz
I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet
Mother love ah ha

I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone

Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die

All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet
Mother love ah ha (mother love)

My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet
Mother love

(Mother love, mother love, love love love love)
God works in mysterious ways
Eeeeh dop, de dop, dep dop
I think I'm goin' back to the things I learned so well in my youth

Turn it up a bit please
My baby
Baby does
My baby does, me good
My baby does
My baby does me
My baby does me good
My lady
Understands
Understands me right
She understands me
She understands me
Understands me right
Mmmmmmm
My baby cares
She really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good then she hurts me so
She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat
My baby loves me
My baby loves me (ooh)
My baby cuffs me (ooh)
One day she'll tells me that she cares
Another day she tells me she don't love me
She really really does me
Ooh, people do you believe this ?, do you ?
Oo ooh, ah
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh she really really really really really really aah, does me, hey
Aah, aah
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever, ooh yeah
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong

Ah, then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah

Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother Mercury Mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
La la la la la la la la la la la la
This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved, eaah eah
Here we go
Tellin' lies
Here we go - here we go
We're right back where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray - hey
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Aah - oh Lord, I thank you from above
My life has been saved
Ooh ooh ooh ooh my life
My life has been saved
Ooh my life
My life has been saved
Another party is over
And I'm left cold sober
Baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low, so
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood, so now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues
No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I don't want to feel like a stranger no
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on I'll forget her
My bodies aching can't sleep at night
I'm to exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love her
Love her love her love her
Come on baby let's get together
I'll love you baby I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard to stay away
What made you change
What did I say
Ooh I need your loving tonight
Ooh I need your loving 
Ooh I need your loving 
Ooh I need your loving babe tonight
Hit me
Ooh I need your loving tonight
No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
Can't be no warning how could I guess
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving tonight
There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry
And the rain's stopped falling
Please don't you cry any more
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

Even the valley's below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore)
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)
You sent me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Ah ah nevermore, nevermore
A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in heaven
Do you want us to cry? 
And everywhere the broken-hearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
And life goes on 
Without you
Another tricky situation
I get to drownin' in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do? 
Yes, it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation (sensation)
You found a way through (found a way through)
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember 
Forever
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was it the way it was planned? 
And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
Cryin' for nothing
Cryin' for no one
No one but you
Here I stand (here I stand)
Look around around around around around
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)
Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes you made me live again, wow
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight
Ooh whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be, ooh, don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just peaches 'n' me
Don't I love her so
Yes you made me live again, yeah
Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me
Don't I love him so
Ooh, don't I love him so
Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you
Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around around around around around around
Down in the city justa you 'n' me (down in the city justa you 'n' me)
Don't I love you so
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Wooh
Fa fa fa fa fa
Fa fa fa fa faa
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight
He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of a hand incredible size
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight
Fa fa fa fa faa
Hoooa
The ogre-men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south
Aaargh
Aaaaaaaarghh
Ogre-men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more - oh oh oh
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
Fa fa fa fa faa
Why
Hey
One man, one goal
One mission
One heart, one soul 
Just one solution
One flash of light, yeah one god one vision
One flesh one bone
One true religion
One voice one hope
One real decision
Wowowowo gimme one vision, oh
No wrong no right
I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is one world wide vision
One flesh one bone
One true religion
One voice one hope
One real decision
Wowowowowowo, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I had a dream
When I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows
And a dark rain falls
And in my heart it shows
Look what they've done to my dream
One vision
So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready
There's only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision
No hate no fight
Just excitation
All through the night
It's a celebration wowowowo yeah
One one one one one one one
One flesh one bone
One true religion
One voice one hope
One real decision
Gimme one night (yeah)
Gimme one hope (hey)
Just gimme
One man one man
One bar one night
One day hey hey
Just gimme gimme gimme
Fried chicken
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you, yeah
My heart cries out to your heart
I'm lonely but you can save me
My hand reaches for to your hand
I'm cold but you light the fire in me
My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment just surrender

And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much
Ooh yes it hurts
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender to your love
Just surrender to your love
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
And all I can do is surrender
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time
When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation
So in love but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong - you turn out the light
But inside of your mind you put up a fight
Where are the answers that we're all searching for
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure, ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
All your life
Ooh ooh ooh
Pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure
Don't touch me now
Don't hold me now
Don't break the spell darling, now you are near
Look in my eyes
And speak to me
Those special promises I long to hear
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Love me slow and gently
One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through the never ending cold
And all for fear, and all for greed
Speak any tongue but for God's sake we need
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Let me know, this night and evermore
This room is bare
This night is cold
We're far apart and I'm growing old
But while we live, we'll meet again
So then my love we may whisper once more
It's you I adore
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Touch me now, oh wooh hoo
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
For evermore (for evermore)
For evermore
It was the third of september
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
Never had a chance to see him, no
Never heard nothing but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said
[chorus]
"papa was a rollin' stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone"
[repeat]
Hey, mama, is it true what they say
That papa never worked aday in his life
Some bad talk going around sayin'
Papa had three outside children
And another wife
That ain't right
Heard some talk about papa and his storefront
Preachin'
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time
Leachin'
And dealing in dirt
Stealin' in the name of the Lord
But mama she just said
[chorus]
Say I heard my papa was a jack of all trades
Is that what papa sent to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal just
To pay his bills
Hey, mama, folks say papa was never much in thinkin'
Spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'
But mother, I'm depending on you
To tell me the truth
But my mama she just said
[chorus (2x)]
We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
Party was over - huh
The party was over
We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know I know we got what it takes
Woah woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Why don't you come back and play
Come back and play - hey hey - come back and play
We got all night all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play - play play, come back and play
Come back and play, come back and play play play play, aah
Go get 'em boy - let's party
Yeah - ha ha ha ha haaa - give it, give it
We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night singing - singin'
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hung-over
Hey, come back and play, come back and play, come back and play
We got all night all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play - and play
Come back and play
We got all night, we got all day
We got all night to play
Ah, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback and play
Hey hey hey
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, the party is over
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you
How I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived the lie
"I love you 'til I die"

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home

Each night I cry and still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die

(Save me, save me, save me)
Yea, yeah
Save me yeah save me oh save me
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home
Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game, everybody play the game
Of love
When your feeling down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game everybody play the game of love
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping trough my veins (play the game)
Driving me insane
Play the game, play the game, play the game, play the game
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game, yeah, play the game of love
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free, free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game, play the game of love
Here we are, born to be kings
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong, fighting to survive
In a world with the darkest powers
Heh
And here we are, we're the princes of the universe
Here we belong, fighting for survival
We've come to be the rulers of you all
I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings, yeah, yeah
I have no rival, no man can be my equal
Take me to the future of you all
Born to be kings, princes of the universe
Fighting and free
Got your world in my hand
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand
We were born to be princes of the universe
No man could understand
My power is in my own hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, people talk about you
People say you've had your day
I'm a man that will go far
Fly the moon and reach for the stars
With my sword and head held high
Got to pass the test first time, yeah
I know that people talk about me, I hear it every day
But I can prove them wrong 'cause I'm right first time
Yeah, yeah
Alright, let's go, let's go, ha ha
Yeah, watch this man fly, wooh
Bring on the girls, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Here we are (here we are)
Born to be kings, we're the princes of the universe
Here we belong
Born to be kings, princes of the universe
Fighting and free, got your world in my hand
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand
We were born to be princes of the universe (universe, universe, universe)
They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy
He disappointed me
So I got my hand gun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
And I had to make him pay
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out baby it's the season
For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution's right on my side
'Cause I caught my lover in the neighbour's bed
I got retribution
Filled 'em all full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, baby put out the fire
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds
You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead
Shoot, shoot...
(Radio)
(Radio)
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious - honey
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall
No problem

Bully you all over
With property and finance

To call the shots and name the price - honey
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall
Flo Jo
You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool, ha, kiss kiss
Others seem to think
You are over dramatizing
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions - honey
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool, get serious, wooh, alright

I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Like I'm reaching out for you

Children are fantasizing
Grown-ups are standin' by

With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand
(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of the, hope of the man
It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah
Mountains are zoomin' higher, uh
Little girls scream an' cry
My world is spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin'

Sends me reeling

Thank you very much
Hey little babe you're changing
Babe are you feeling sore?
It ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say?
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way?

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you

Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
You know that I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free, yeah

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down my friend
Sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again

Hot child don't you know you're young
You got your whole life ahead of you?
And you can throw it away too soon
Way too soon

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody's
Gonna love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you
How I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
I love you till I die
Save me save me save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me save me save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home
The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart I'm cold inside
I have no real intent
Save me save me save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me save me save me
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home
Each night I cry I still believe the lie
I love you 'till I die
Save me save me save me
Save me save me oh save me
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me save me oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home
The harder we play
The faster we fall
When we think that we know it all
We know nothing at all
The letter arrives
Like a bolt from the blue
So what's left of your lives
All your dreams lost to you
Say it's not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it's not true
Say it for real
Can't be happening to you
Can't be happening to me
It's hard not to cry
It's hard to believe
So much heartache and pain
So much reason to grieve
With the wonders of science
All the knowledge we've stored
Magic cocktails for lives
People just can't afford
Say it's not true
You can say it's not right
It's hard to believe
The size of the crime
Say it's not true
You can say it's not real
Could be happening to you
Could be happening to me
Eeh dah eeh dah
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Hey scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break
They'll hear me pleading, we'll say for God's sakes
Over and over and over again
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds
Hey scandal, and all the world can make us out to be fools
Here come the bad news, open the floodgates (oooh oooh)
They'll leave us bleeding, we say you cheapskates
(Oooh oooh)
Over and over and over again
So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care
It's only a life to be twisted and broken
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break - yeah
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sakes
Over and over and over and over again - yeah
Scandal, scandal
Scandal, scandal
Yes you're breaking my heart again
Scandal - yes it'll all and all happen again
Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times
And no-one ever really knows the truth from the lies
And in the end the story deeper must hide (oooh)
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside
Scandal, scandal
Scandal, scandal
Seagull, you fly across the horizon
Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asked you where you are going
Nobody knows where you're from
Here is a man asking the question
Is this really the end of the world
Seagull you must have known for a long time
The shape of things to come
Now you fly through the sky
Never asking why, and you fly
All around till somebody shoots you down
Da-da-da-down, mmm, mmm
Now you seagull you fly, seagull you fly away
And you'll fly away today
And you'll fly away tomorrow
And you'll fly away, leave me to my sorrow
Well, she's gone, dear, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh Lord, what a fool I've been
Yes, I did too much
Didn't leave, didn't leave no letter
Didn't leave no warning (you naughty thing you)
I guess I'm all to blame, oh Lord
I guess I'm all to blame (see you later... right now you)
Take it
My little dog ain't too hungry, no, no; he just kept on barking 
Viciously
Just don't seem the same, oh, no, no
It just don't seem the same (oh, see you later)
Now hit it like that
Coming on strong
Well, I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbor
She said, "mm, mm, mm, mm, mm."
Oh Lord, what a fool I've been
And she told me what to do
She said, "go home."
Well, she's gone, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been, oh Lord
What a fool I've been
My, my, my, my

And I now know you will satisfy me

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime,
Didn't you?
People'd call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
They thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't walk so proud
Now you don't talk so loud
About having to be scrounging 
For your next meal 
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone? 
You've went to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
But now you're gonna have to get 
Used to it
They said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you
Realize
That he's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal? 
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone? 
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone? 
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they
Got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts
You'd better take your diamond ring,
You'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags with the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal 
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone?
You go and I'll come with you little baby
You go and I'll go with you little baby
You go and I'll come with you
You bet your life that I'll walk with you
You go and I'll come with you little baby 
You go to court and I'll come along
You go to jail and I'll get your bond
You got time tell you what I'll do
I'll stay outside and wait for you 
You go and I'll come with you little baby
You go and I'll go with you little baby

You get the fare I'll go the show
You bet the horses and I'll pick up the
Dough
You work hard and it hurt my pride
I'll be there right by your side
I got nasty habits, I take tea at three 
Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner 
Must be hung up for a week 
My best friend, he shoots water rats 
And feeds them to his geese 
Don'cha think there's a place for you 
In between the sheets? 
Come on now, baby 
We can build a home for three 
Come on now, baby
Don't you want to live with me? 
And there's a score of harebrained children 
They're all locked in the nursery 
They got earphone heads they got dirty necks 
They're so 20th century 
They queue up for the bathroom 
'Round about 7:35 
Don'cha think we need a woman's touch to make it come alive? 
You'd look good pram pushing 
Down the high street 
Come on now, baby
Don't you want to live with me? 
Come on now, baby 
We can build a home for three 
Come on now, baby
Don't you want to live with me? 
Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear 
The cook she is a whore 
Yes, the butler has a place for her 
Behind the pantry door 
The maid, she's French, she's got no sense 
She's wild for Crazy Horse 
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips 
The footman's eyes get crossed 
Don'cha think there's a place for us 
Right across the street 
Don'cha think there's a place for you, 
In between the sheets?
Come on now, baby 
We can build a home for three 
Come on now, baby
Don't you want to live with me?
You say you love me darling,
Please, call me on the phone sometime.
You say you love me darling,
Please, call me on the phone sometime.
When I hear your voice,
Ease my worried mind.
One of these days,
I'm gonna show you how nice a man can be.
One of these days,
I'm gonna show you just how nice a man can be.
I'm gonna buy you a brand, new Cadillac,
If you only speak some good words about me.
Hear my phone ringing,
Sound like a long distance call.
Hear my phone keep ringing,
Sound like a long distance call.
When I picked up my receiver,
The party said another mule kicking in your stall.
Baby, baby been a long, long time, been a long, long time
Been a long, long time, I was wrong girl and you were right
Baby, baby, took a long, long while, took a long, long while
Took a long, long while, but I found out you were right

Still you have those happy eyes. I will try and apologize
Baby, baby, still the same old smile
Still the same old smile
Still the same old smile, I was so wrong
And you were right
Still you have those happy eyes
Yes, I, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try and apologize

Oh baby, baby been a long, long time
Been a long, long time, been a long, long time
I was wrong girl and you were right

Oh baby, baby, won't you change your mind
Won't you change your mind
Won't you change your mind?
I was wrong girl, but not this, no, I, I said
Baby, baby, been a long, long time

It's been such a long lonely time
It's been such a long, a long, long time
I was wrong, but I admit, I admit you were right
Oh come on now, baby, baby I just want to change your mind
I wanted to change your mind, baby
I wanted to, come on and change your mind
I was wrong, I, I, I, oh
Now look what you've done 
Now look what you've done 
Look what you've done baby 
Now look what you've done 
You left me here 
The lonely one 
And all I can say 
Is look what you've done 
A broken heart 
A worried mind 
Because of you baby 
Dying all the time 
I once had a dream 
But now I've none 
Your taking your love 
And see what it done 
I saw you last night 
Out moving round 
With your new turf 
You paint the town 
That is OK 
You're having your fun 
Because some day 
They call you done 
And now your bird cries 
The shadow falls 
Gloomy memories 
And I recall 
Your love is my life 
As warm as the sun 
But now it is gone 
And see what it done
Ain't it funny how things happen
Just as we think we've got it all straight
Everything seems to be moving forward
But instead we just sit around and wait
Seems things are in a lock down
Nervous looks all around
Everyone is speaking in whispers
No one wants to make a sound
I'm losing my touch, yeah
Losing my touch
Losing my touch baby, way too much
Baby, get me out of here
It should be clear
Keep an eye on on your front door, baby
I'll be slipping in round the back
I just need a little, a little cab fare
And then I'll let you hit the sack
Cause I'm losing my touch
Losing my touch
Yes I'm losing my touch way too much
Baby, get me out of here
It should be clear, yes
I ain't going to keep it long, baby
But just long, long enough
I've got to pick up my passports
And I've got to get my stuff
Cause I'm losing my touch
Just losing my touch, baby, baby, baby
I'm losing my touch way, way too much
Baby, get me out of here
Well it must be clear
Losing my touch
Yes I'm losing my touch
Yes I'm losing my touch way too much
Baby get me out of here
Well I followed her, to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Yeah, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Whoa, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain
When the train, come in the station
I looked her in the eye
Well the train come in the station
And I looked her in the eye
Whoa, I felt so sad so lonesome
That I could not help but cry
When the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Yeah, when the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Whoa, the blue light was my baby
And the red light was my mind
All my love was in vain
All my love's in vain
I'm the man on the mountain, come on up.
I'm the plowman in the valley with a face full of mud.
Yes, I'm fumbling and I know my car don't start.
Yes, I'm stumbling and I know I play a bad guitar.

Give me little drink from your loving cup.
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.

I'm the man who walks the hillside in the sweet summer sun.
I'm the man that brings you roses when you ain't got none.
Well I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight
You if you want to push and pull with me all night.

Give me little drink from you loving cup.
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.

I feel so humble with you tonight,
Just sitting in front of the fire.
See your face dancing in the flame,
Feel your mouth kissing me again,
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz,
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz.
Oh, what a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz.

Yes, I am nitty gritty and my shirt's all torn,
But I would love to spill the beans with you till dawn.

Give me little drink from your loving cup.
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.

Give me little drink
Give me little drink
Give me little drink
Give me little drink
Give me little drink

Give me little drink
Give me little drink
Give me little drink
Give me little drink

Give me little drink
Give me little drink
Won't you give me the low down 
Just as quick as you can 
Baby, I've been out of touch 
Just give me the scam 
Don't give me the sports page, baby 
No political news 
Don't you give me the gossip 
Just give me the truth 
Just between me and you 
Give me the low down 
If you can 
Don't want a show down 
I just want to know where I stand 
Don't read me the horoscope babe 
That ain't what I need

I'm banging on my door cause I just lost my key 
Open up, baby, you got someone else inside

Melody, it was her second name 
Melody, it was her second name 
Melody, it was her second name

I took her out dancing but she drank away my cash 
She said, "I'm going to fix my face don't you worry I'll be back" 
I'm looking for her high and low like a mustard for a ham 
She was crashed out in the bathroom 
In the arms of my best friend 
Melody, it was her second name 
Melody, it was her second name 
Melody, it was her second name 
Melody, it was her second name
Then one day she left me 
She took everything that moved 
My car, she took my trailer home

My nose is on her trail 
I'm going to catch her by surprise 
Then I'm going to have the pleasure 
To roast that child alive

Didn't I see you down in San Antone on a hot and dusty night?
We were eating eggs in Sammy's when the black man there drew his knife
Aw, you drowned that Jew in Rampton as he washed his sleeveless shirt
You know, that Spanish-speaking gentlemen the one we all called Kurt
Come now, gentleman, I know there's some mistake
How forgetful I'm becoming now you fixed your business straight
I remember you in Hemlock Road in nineteen fifty-six
You're a faggy little leather boy with a smaller piece of stick
You're a lashing, smashing hunk of man your sweat shines sweet and strong
Your organs working perfectly but there's a part that's not screwed on
Weren't you at the Coke convention back on nineteen sixty-five?
You're the misbred, gray executive I've seen heavily advertised
You're the great, gray man whose daughter licks policemen's buttons clean
You're the man who squats behind the man who works the soft machine
Come now, gentleman your love is all I crave
You'll still be in the circus when I'm laughing, laughing in my grave
When the old men do the fighting and the young men all look on
And the young girls eat their mothers meat from tubes of plasticon
Be wary of these my gentle friends of all the skins you breed
They have a tasty habit they eat the hands that bleed
So remember who you say you are and keep your noses clean
Boys will be boys and play with toys so be strong with your beast
Oh Rosie dear, don'tcha think it's queer so stop me if you please
The baby is dead, my lady said, "You gentlemen, why, you all work for me"
Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl 
Her eyes were hazel 
And her nose were slightly curved 
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel 
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well 
It took a starry to steal my breath away 
Down on the water front 
Her hair all drenched in spray 
Hannah baby was a honey of a girl 
Her eyes were hazel 
And her teeth were slightly curved 
She took my guitar and she began to play 
She sang a song to me 
Stuck right in my brain 
You're just a memory of a love 
That used to be 
You're just a memory of a love 
That used to mean so much to me 
She got a mind of her own 
And she use it well 
Well she's one of a kind 
She's got a mind 
She got a mind of her own 
And she use it mighty fine 
She drove a pick-up truck 
Painted green and blue 
The tires were wearing thin 
She turned a mile or two 
When I asked her where she headed for 
"Back up to Boston I'm singing in a bar" 
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge 
My nerves are shot already 
The road ain't all that smooth 
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone 
I keep on a feeling that's gnawing in my bones 
You're just a memory of a love 
That used to mean so much to me 
You're just a memory girl 
You're just a sweet memory 
And it used to mean so much to me 
Sha la la la la 
She got a mind of her own 
And she use it well 
Mighty fine, she's one of a kind 
On the seventh day my eyes were all a glaze 
We've been ten thousand miles 
Been in fifteen states 
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind 
I hit the bottle and hit the sack and cried 
What's all this laughter on the 22nd floor 
It's just some friends of mine 
And they're busting down the door 
Been a lonely night at the Memory Motel
Long distance information, give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party tryin' to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
'Cause the phone boy took the message and he wrote it on the wall 
Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge 
Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mama did not agree
She tore apart a happy home in Memphis, Tennessee 
Well last time I saw Marie, she's wavin' me goodbye
With "hurry home" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee
Oh try to get her number back in Memphis, Tennessee
Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
Well I went to see the gypsy 
To have my fortune read 
She said, "man, your baby gonna leave you 
Her bags are packed up under the bed" 
That's right 
Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
But if you leave me baby 
Girl, if you put me down 
I'm gonna make it to the nearest river, child 
And jump overboard and drown 
That's right 
Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
I said hey, hey, baby, hey, hey, now 
What you tryin' to do? Huh
Hey, hey baby, hey, hey now 
Please don't say we're through, yeah, yeah, yeah
Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
But if you stay, baby 
I tell you what I'm gonna do 
I'm gonna work two jobs, seven days a week 
And bring my money home to you 
That's right 
Have mercy, please, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me, yeah
Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
The one that shut the kitchen door
He don't give a hoot of warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
He don't go in the light of the morning
He split the time the cock'rel crows

Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall
Sighin' down the wind so sadly
Listen and you'll hear him moan
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go
Yeah

Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before

(Don't you do that)

Well you heard about the Boston,
It's not one of those
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight, sh,
The one that closed the bedroom door
I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well he's pouncing like a proud black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so
Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler
Play it easy, as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

Did you hear about the midnight rambler
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler
And did you see me make my midnight call

And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby and it hurts!
Down and down she goes 
Our, Amanda Jones 
I said down and down and down and down 
She'd look really lovely at home 
Til somebody gonna come up and ask her 
To live happily ever after, Miss Amanda Jones 
On and on she goes 
Little Miss Amanda Jones 
I said on and on and on and on 
Just watch her as she grow 
Don't want to say it very obviously 
But she's losing her nobility, Miss Amanda Jones 
Hey girl don't you realize 
The money invested in you 
Hey girl you just got to find 
Someone who'll really pull your family through 
Up and up she goes 
Our Amanda Jones 
I said up and up and up and up 
She looks quite delightfully stoned 
She's the darling of the discotheque crowd 
Of her lineage she's rightfully proud, miss Amanda Jones 
  
Hey girl with your nonsense nose 
All pointing right down at the floor 
Hey girl your suspender shows 
And the girl behind you looks a bit unsure 
Round and round she goes 
The world of Amanda Jones 
I said round and round and round and round 
The balls and the dinners and show 
The little girl she just wanders about 
Til it's time for her coming out, miss Amanda Jones 
Round and round and round 
Round and round and round...

I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
I've been stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Fooling on my time

What a drag it is getting old
"Kids are different today,"
I hear ev'ry mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill
There's a little yellow pill
She goes running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day
"Things are different today,"
I hear ev'ry mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake and she burns her frozen steak
And goes running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And two help her on her way, get her through her busy day
Doctor please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old
"Men just aren't the same today"
I hear ev'ry mother say
They just don't appreciate that you get tired
They're so hard to satisfy, You can tranquilize your mind
So go running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight
Doctor please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old
"Life's just much too hard today,"
I hear ev'ry mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those, you will get an overdose
No more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way, through your busy dying day

Are you used to the idea 
My obsessions are 
Your possessions 
Do you feel at home right here 
You should relax it's my impression 
Didn't see you were so young 
I could almost be your son 
Please turn in my direction, no objection
Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors
Neighbors, have I got neighbors?
Have I got neighbors?
All day and all night

Neighbors
Have I got neighbors?
Ringing my doorbells
All day and all night

Ladies, have I got crazies?
Scheming young babies
No piece and no quiet
I got T.V.'s, saxophone playing
Groaning and straining
With the trouble and strife

Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
That we fuss and fight

Neighbors, do unto strangers
Do unto neighbors
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself

Is it any wonder

You know that neighbors
Steal off my table
Steal off my table
And doing alright, alright, alright, alright

Neighbors do unto strangers

What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself
Your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, alright
Take me to the station
And put me on a train
I've got no expectations
To pass through here again

Once I was a rich man and
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before

You heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind

Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
Its here, and then its gone

So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I've got no expectations
To pass through here again
Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me
Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me
Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me

Standing in the kitchen
Looking way out cross the fields
You see a face in the window
It's not real, it's not real

Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me, stay away
Ain't no use
Ain't no use
Ain't no use
Ain't no use

Ain't no use in crying, stay away from me
Stay away

Standing at the station
And gazing down the track
There ain't no train coming baby
I ain't never, never coming back

Standing in the balcony
Looking way out towards the sea
If you see your ship come a sailing
It's not me, it's not me
It's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me
Stay away from me

Ain't no use, ain't no use, ain't no use, ain't no use
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away from me
Ain't no use in crying
Stay away from me

Sittin' in my bedroom late last night 
Got into bed and turned out the light 
Decided to call my baby on the telephone 
All I got was an engaged tone 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
Talkin' so long she upset my mind 
Why is she talkin' such a long time? 
Maybe she's sleeping, maybe she's ill 
Phone's disconnected, unpaid bill 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
Don't want to see her, afraid of what I'd find 
Tired of letting her upset me all the time 
Back into bed started reading my books 
Take my phone right off of the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook

You fell out of the clear blue sky 
To the darkness below 
The smell of your flesh excites me 
My blood starts to flow 
So help me God 
You burst in in a blaze of light 
You unzippered the dark 
One kiss took my breath away 
One look lights up the stars 
And it's it's one hit to the body 
It comes straight from the heart 
One hit to the body 
Sure went straight to the mark 
So help me God 
It's one shot when you love me 
One shot when you leave me 
I don't need no security 
I just need some peace 
And it's one hit to the body 
It comes straight from the heart 
One voice calls out my name 
It sure went straight to the mark 
One punch and you knocked me down 
Tore my defenses apart 
One round took me out of the game 
You did me some permanent harm 
It took just one hit

I was out in the city 
I was out in the rain 
I was feeling down hearted 
I was drinking again 
I was standing by the bridges 
Where the dark water flows 
I was talking to a stranger 
About times long ago 
I was young 
I was foolish 
I was angry 
I was vain 
I was charming 
I was lucky 
Tell me how have I changed 
Now I'm out 
Oh out of control 
Now I'm out 
Oh out of control 
Oh help me now 
And the girls in the doorway 
And the boys in the game 
And the drunks and the homeless 
They all know me 
And the police on the corner 
Give a nod and a wave 
As they point me 
To my final destination 
I was young 
I was foolish 
I was angry 
I was vain 
I was charming 
Feeling lucky 
Tell me how have I changed 
Now I'm out 
Oh out of control 
Now I'm out 
Oh out of control 
Oh help me now 
In the hotel I'm excited 
By the smile on her face 
But I wondered 
How was time 
Gonna change her 
I was young 
I was foolish 
I was angry 
I was vain 
I was charming 
I was out there 
Tell me how have I changed 
Now I'm out 
Oh out of control 
Oh I'm out 
Oh out of control
Pain in my heart 
Treatin' me poor

This pain in my heart 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Pain in my heart 
This pain in my heart
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up, when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
I want to see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky
I want to see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah! Hmm, hmm, hmm
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
I'll break big in New Orleans
And I'll overspill in Caroline

Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
I'll make my blow in Dallas
And get hot again in half the time

Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Well, my heavy throbbers itchin'
Just to lay a solitary rhythm down
The sound that you're listenin' to
Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame
I don't think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when I'm blue it's seems like Lucille
Tryin' to help me callin' my name
I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues
Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille
Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then
You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely
I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'
You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille
Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this
A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now
You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has
I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life
The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean
And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille
Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me
One more now, Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?
Look out, Lucille
Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright
Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know
But don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Your mother she's an heiress, owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could
But don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Your old man took her diamond's and tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Now you've got some diamonds and you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire
She comes on like a rose
And everybody knows
She'll get you in dutch
You can look but you'd better not touch

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around

She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
But if you let her get under your skin

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around

Measles make you bumpy and mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll cool you but whooping cough'll fool you
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping

The fields of Eden
Are full of trash
And if we beg and we borrow and steal
We'll never get it back
People are hungry
They crowd around
And the city gets bigger as the country comes begging to town

Stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock and a hard place

This talk of freedom
And human rights
Man's bullying and private wars and chucking all the dust into our eyes
And peasant people
Poorer than dirt
Who are caught in the crossfire with nothing to lose but their shirts, yeah

Stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock and a hard place
You'd better stop, put on a kind face
Between a rock and a hard place

We're in the same boat
On the same sea
And we're sailing south
On the same breeze
Building dream churches
With silver spires
And our rogue children
Are playing loaded dice

Between a rock and a hard place
You'd better stop, yeah

Give me the truth now
Don't want no shame
I'd be hung drawn and quartered for a sheep just as well as a lamb

Stuck between a rock
And a hard place
A rock and a hard place
You'd better stop put on a kind face
Can't you see what you've done to me
Oh yeah!

I hear you talking when I'm on the street,
Your mouth don't move but I can hear you speak.
What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more,
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?
I'm always hearing voices on the street,
I want to shout, but I can't hardly speak.
I was making love last night
To a dancer friend of mine.
I can't seem to stay in step,
'Cause she come ev'ry time that she pirouettes over me.
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming,
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping.
I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed.
Plug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed.
Heading for the overload,
Splattered on the dirty road,
Kick me like you've kicked before,
I can't even feel the pain no more.
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming, (only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping.
Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene.
Its all mesmerized, all that inside me.
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me.
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery.
Headed for the overload,
Splattered on the dirty road,
Kick me like you've kicked before,
I can't even feel the pain no more.
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off, get them off),
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off, get them off).
I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off, get them off),
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off, get them off).
(Only get them off, get them off) (only get them off, get them off)

While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows, she comes and goes

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothings gained
And nothings lost, at such a cost

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you will lose your mind

When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Someone woke me up this mornin'
And I lit a cigarette
Found myself when I stopped yawnin'
Started getting myself dressed

Then I felt that I had a dream
I remembered the things that I'd seen
I could still hear the things you said
With that bad dream in my head

It was a sad day, bad day
Sad day, bad day

So I called you on the phone
And your friend said, "She's not home"
So I told her where I'd be at
And that you should call me back

Then I looked at the morning mail
I was not even expecting a bill
Your letter a-started, "Dear"
And it left me with these tears

It was a sad day, bad day
Sad day, bad day

Think of the times that we had rows
But we patched them up somehow
Think of the times I tried to go
But you screamed and told me no

There is only one thing in this world
That I can't understand, that's a girl
I keep a-readin' the things you said
Like a bad dream in my head

It was a sad day, bad day
Sad day, bad day

Oh, what a sad, sad old day
A sad old day, it was a sad old day
A sad old day, it was a bad old day
A sad old day, a bad old day

If there is one awful thing in this world
That I can't understand, that's a girl
It was a sad, sad old day
Sad old day, it was a sad old day

Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

And when I search a faceless crowd
A swirling mass of gray and
Black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact, they look so strange

Raise your glass to the hard working people
Let's drink to the uncounted heads
Let's think of the wavering millions
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead

Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of the gray suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio

And when I look in the faceless crowd
A swirling mass of grays and
Black and white
They don't look real to me
Or don't they look so strange

Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the two thousand million
Let's think of the humble of birth

New York was cold and damp
TV is just a blank
Looks like another dead end Sunday

What about an early night
Monday never feels so bright
Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely

Who wants to brave the pouring rain
For a glass of French champagne?
Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by

And she was hot, as she kissed my mouth
She was hot, as I wiped her brow
She was hot, she pinned me to the ground
She was quick, she knew her way around
She was hot, as she tore my clothes
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

Detroit was smoky grey
Nothing like the good old days
Well I got a fever that I'm fighting

I don't need your company
Leave me in my misery
I can take the rebound just like lightning

And she was hot, in a 50's dress
She was hot, her lips were flashing red
I was lost, in her burning flesh
I was hot, I was dripping sweat
She was hot, in the Detroit snow
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

And she was hot, and I had the blues
She was hot, honey, where were you?
If you were in my shoes
You would be excused

She was hot, you could never wait
She was hot, never hesitate
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

I think I'm going off the rails
Riding down the pleasure trails
I was taking passion where you find it

Honey when you're young and fresh
And you need the touch of flesh
Go take the treasure where you find it

And she was hot, in the melted snow
She was hot, in the molten glow
She was hot, she got it in the blood
She was hot, like the dam that bursts
She was strong, she was strong and true
She was black, and her eyes were blue
She was lost, and she took a chance
At just a brief romance

Down the avenue into the lost bayou
Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo
I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again
In a cold Chicago night

She was hot
She was hot
She was hot hot hot
She was hot hot hot
She was hot hot hot
She was hot hot hot
She was hot hot hot
She was hot hot hot
She was hot hot hot
She was hot hot hot
I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
I'm so hot for her, I'm on fire for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano
I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
Yeah, I tried re-wiring her, tried re-firing her
I think her engine is permanently stalled
She's so cold she's so cold
She's so cold cold cold
Like a tombstone
She's so cold, she's so cold
She's so cold cold cold like an ice cream cone
She's so cold she's so cold
I dare not touch her my hand just froze
Yeah, I'm so hot for hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and even so
Put your hand on the heat, put your hand on the heat
Aw c'mon baby, let's go
She's so cold, she's so cold, cold, she's so c-c-c-old
But she's beautiful, though
Yeah, she's so cold
She's so cold, she's so cold
She was born in an arctic zone
She's so cold she's so cold, cold, cold
I dare not touch her my hand just froze
She's so cold, she's so goddamn cold she's so
Cold cold cold she's so cold
Who would believe you were a beauty indeed
When the days get shorter and the nights get long
Lie awake when the rain comes
Nobody will know, when you're old
When you're old, nobody will know
That you was a beauty, a sweet sweet beauty
A sweet sweet beauty, but stone stone cold
You're so cold, you're so cold, cold, cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
I'm so hot for you, I'm so hot for you
I'm so hot for you and you're so cold
I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano
Saw you stretched out in Room Ten O Nine
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye.
Oh, couldn't see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love.
Berber jewelry jangling down the street,
Making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet.
Could not seem to get a high on you, my sweet honey love.

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Make every song (you sing) your favorite tune.
May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Warm like the evening sun.

When you're drunk in the alley, baby, with your clothes all torn
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn.
Just seemed too many flies on you, I just can't brush them off.
Angels beating all their wings in time,
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes.
Whoa, thought I heard one sigh for you,
Come on up, come on up, now, come on up now.

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Make every song you sing your favorite tune.
May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Warm like the evening sun.

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Make every song you sing your favorite tune.
May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Warm like the evening sun.

Here I lie in my hospital bed
Tell me, sister Morphine, when are you coming round again?
Oh, I don't think I can wait that long
Oh, you see that I'm not that strong

The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears
Tell me, sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here?
What am I doing in this place?

And posing with her hang hair down, lookin' a little bit
Unmade
She spoke in broken English, I replied in broken French
'Come and share my popcorn, it's not a federal offense

Why does the rain fall down on the earth
Why do the clouds keep cryin'
Why do you sleep curled up like a child
Some things just stick in your mind 
Why when the children grow up and leave
Still remember their nursery rhymes
Why must there be so much hate in their lives
Some things just stick in their minds
He walks along singing his fairy song
Picking up magic that grows at his feet.
She says the same her peculiar way
Dreaming good fortune on everyone's street.
Say, hey, have you heard, blue whiskey's the rage,
I'll send you a jug in the morning.
It is absurd to live in a cage,
You know there's got to be something better.
As they go by, don't look with eagle's eyes
Smile on your jailers until they grow weak.
Nothing can compare to something that's almost there
To tear up the madness that all of us seek.
Say, hey, have you heard, blue whiskey's the rage,
I'll send you a jug in the morning.
It is absurd to live in a cage,

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
(Woo woo, woo woo)

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
(Woo woo, woo woo)

I shouted out,
Who killed the Kennedys?
When after all
It was you and me
(Who who, who who)

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay
(Woo woo, who who)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
(Who who)
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby
(Who who, who who)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
(Woo woo, who who)

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
(Who who, who who)

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
(Woo woo)
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah
(Woo woo, woo woo)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, mm yeah

They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
They kind with seashells driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart

We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago
Who knows?
Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows?
Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
It's an odd alliance
It's another light I say
What alone tonight
Even if my eyes
Even have some time
Bet it all tonight
Listen I have been banging away
Even if you had a sight
My
It's mad enough tonight
And forests have never grown
It's another light
And I can never have mine
It's not mine
It's not mine
Instead I hide
I've been here for my friends
I never know if I said
Watching out for me
When I can love you
Have your way
And she might as well know I
Seem more high
High
Than
I said minerals will make the world
If we did not have chemicals
You would not be writing my death certificate
Biting is my friend
My dog left me a sand send
One more day than I can plan
Ends safe from you
Biting ass a lie friend
When I will never have a friend
Biting silent as a man
His silence setting up around
And she improvised
And she was supervised
I was a rised
Or arosed
Or a rose
Or a rose
Or aroused
And fine
Fine line
When I
Said night time
When I
Could never kind
And I
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
It's hard and boiled
And sour all again
My milk is your shit
It revolves
It evolves
Cause it's biting out what would
My milk is your shit
My milk is piss
Don't you love that I can bite

May day, every day, my day
Could've had a heart attack, my heart
We don't know anything, my heart
We all want something fair, my heart

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Out of town, out of sight, is my heart
Queen of lies, today, my heart
One more on the phone, my heart
One more at the door of my heart

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Mean heart
Cold heart
Cold heart

Yeah
Take a step outside yourself
And turn around
Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary
So silly
Revolting
You're not much
You can't do anything
Take a step outside the city
And turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is revolting
You're really nowhere
So wasteful
So foolish
Poppycock
Who said don't look back?
Don't believe 'em
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant
''cause they're gonna try and get behind you
Don't you let them do it
You know what I'm talking about?
You hear me talking?
You hear me talking?
It's pretty scary, it's so revolting
Take a step outside the country
And turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is amazing
Take a good look
You're no big deal
You're so petty
It's lots
Take a step outside the planet
Turn around and around
Take a look at where you are
It's pretty scary
And if you save yourself,
You will make him happy.
He'll keep you in a jar,
And you'll think you're happy.
He'll give you breather holes,
And you'll think you're happy.
He'll cover you with grass
And you'll think you're happy.
[Chorus:]
Now...
You're in a laundry room.
You're in a laundry room.
The clues they came to you...
And if you cut yourself,
You will think you're happy.
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll make him happy.
He'll give you breather holes,
Then you'll think you're happy.
He'll cover you with grass,
Then you'll think you're happy.
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
And if you fool yourself,
You will make him happy.
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll think you're happy.
He'll give you breather holes,
Then you will seem happy.
You'll wallow in the shit,
Then you'll think you're happy.
[Chorus]
I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary lies
I take pride as the kind of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice

If you ever need anything please don't hesitate
to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive.
I've seen it all I was here first

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
Her husband, was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine

My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
The sun, shine
I would shiver the whole night through
That is the way you want it.
You wanted it to be the way you like it. I
I'm no lover.
We wanted you to see it the way you wanted, all right.
I could be crazy
But I could be human.
I never wanted to open your eyes
I could be crazy.
But I could be human.
I never wanted to. yeah!
I'm no lover.
You wanted to be living up in the air, yeah (?).
I'm no lover.
But please let go of the human; that's me.
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never say a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
And I have never failed to fail
Pain
Pain
Pain
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
It's so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
There's talk about someone else
Sterling silver begins to melt
Nothin' really bothers her
She just wants to love herself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it'd come to this
Things have never been so swell
And I have never failed to fail
Pain
Pain
Pain

What's the season of love if you can't have everything
What's the reason of love if you can lose everything
What's the meaning of love, it's a crime if anything
What's the meaning of love, it's grand, it's grand
How can a culture can forget it's plan of yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend
Does it matter anyways
Barely heat the top of friend like it moves everyday
You could shit upon the stairs
You'll be friends
You'll be friends
You'll be friends
You'll be friends
All the kids have laid it out
And it's back is probably
Still it's subtle in the tape
Keep a form on equally
Now you know it's just the fact
Where the world is nowadays
And the day is what we learn
Does it matter anyways

Goring my manhood turns a man off.

Hey, hey, hey! -- then we clash!

She laughs about it.
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right.
Jacking themselves off polyester.
I wanna jump, this isn't right! 
Hey, when am I getting it back?

Don't touch the balls.
I got a dick, dick -- hear my fucking hate!

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July
the people cry and the people moan
Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make their own
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July
I'm so happy because today
I've found my friends
They're in my head

And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found god
Hey, hey, hey
I'm so lonely but that's okay I shaved my head

Piece squares and then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach and I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood

One more day to free my brother

I'll start this off

I scratched 'til I bled

So what should I do?

I can't complain

In a dream my memory has stored
As defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

One more special
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home

When I'm feeling tired
She pushed food through the door
And I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down

The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twist and masturbate

I said so
I said so
I said so

Black windows of paint
I scratched with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones
They point in my way
They come with a flash of light
And take my family away

And very later I have learned to
Accept some friends of ridicule
My whole existence is for your amusement

Well I may think that this whole scene is just a
Too appalling for me
Well, I may be the type who's just mad about
Every little thing that I see, but I can
Color that with history, and make it
Just what I want it to be, well I'm
Blowin' my change on the fan magazines, with all the
Hollywood refugees, oh baby baby oh yeah

I've seen Hollywood Boulevard
Welfare hotel

Uh, that hurt man
Alright
Perfect
Love
Is it true
What they say of you
Gonna call the President
Gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need the FBI
There's not anymore that I can do
All the reasons that you give
I follow you
So when you lead them in, that'll be the end of time it's true
Wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong
Wouldn't be the last I'm sure, I've known
With all the rumors I can tell
Some things didn't work so well
Well anyway, it feels the same
As when you first told me you were gone
So long ago but I still held on
Through all the emotions that I've had to take
And that's the truth, and here's the worst yet
Wouldn't even matter the things that I say
You've made your mind up and gone anyway
And there's no use now in dragging it on
Should've seen it coming all along
Well it's true, oh, I had
My doubts of you
Gonna call the President
Gonna call myself a private eye
Gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI
Gonna make this a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it baby with your morning news
With a sweet hangover
And the headlines too, now
I bet you think I'm doing this all for my health
I should've looked again then at somebody else
Feelin' like I've done way more than wrong
Feelin' like I'm livin' inside of this song
Feelin' like I'm just too tired to care
Feelin' like I've done more than my share
Could've been the way that I carried on
Like a broken record for so long
And I do
Oh, oh
I'm gonna call the President
I'm gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need myself the FBI
Oh, what shall I do?
If I gave my heart to you
It's such a crime you know it's true
Gonna call the president
Gonna need myself a private eye
Ooh, gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI
Gonna make it a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it baby with your morning news
With the sweet hangover and the headlines too
There's not anymore that I can do
[Chorus:]
If the world would end today
All the dreams we had would all just drift away
You know there's nothing more to say
If the world would end would our love slip away
I never knew the way that you looked at me
Would ever mean so much to me
In my heart I found the feelings that I've never shown
Now they've got the best of me
[Chorus:]
I never thought all the love I was looking for
Could ever be so close to me
Your the only one that I've ever loved that has ever loved me
And now you've got the best of me
If the world would end today
All the dreams we had would all just drift away
You know there's nothing more to say
[Chorus:]
Told you once about your friends 
And neighbors
They were always seeking
But they'll never find it
It's alright, it's alright
Where to go and where to see
It's always been this way
And it can never be
It's alright, it's alright
Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see
And you'll begin to learn
That's it's alright, it's alright 
Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and
See it all go through    
But it's alright, it's alright
Told you once about your friends 
And neighbors
They were always seeking
But they'll never find it
It's alright, it's alright
I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She's out to please
She pouts her best
She's out to take
No need to try
She's ready to make

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me

Cars are crashin' every night
I drink n' drive everything's in sight
I make the fire
But I miss the firefight
I hit the bull's eye every night

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
Yeah it's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me
So easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
See me hit you
You fall down

I see standin' there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off

Ya get nothin' for nothin'
If that's what ya do
Turn around bitch I got a use for you
Besides you ain't got nothin' better to do
And I'm bored

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me
So easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
So come with me
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I'll try ta please you
I ain't got no money but it goes to show
It's so easy
So fucking easy
It's so easy
So damn easy
It's so easy
So fucking easy
It's so easy
Mama take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, eh yeah
Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
(You just better start sniffin' your own rank subjugation jack)
('Cause it's just you against your tattered libido)
(The bank and the mortician)
(Forever man and it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive)
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, wow oh yeah
When you were young and your heart 
Was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
What did it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend
And our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you
Or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give
I bought me an illusion
An I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
And I had to have them all
But oh the taste is never so sweet
As what you'd believe it is -
Well I guess it never is
It's these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood
To the heart of the biz
You know I never thought
That it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me
But it feels as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world
And in my songs
So now I've closed the door
To keep the cold outside
Seems somehow I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you
Or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive
Sweetness is a virtue
And you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you
But my conscience always tells me no
You could sell your body on the street
To anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside
And bust your innocence open wide
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
No
Gonna have some fun with my frustrations
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour
'cause this road ain't gettin' clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy for he's a man
Sweetheart don't make me laugh
You's gettin' too big for your pants
And I's think maybe you should
Cut out while you can
You can use your illusion -
Let it take you where it may
We live and learn
And then sometimes it's best to walk away
Me I'm just here hangin' on
It's my only place to stay at least
For now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away
I'm taking time quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy 
So why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts
Can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you 
I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page
Kindness is a treasure 
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown
So I'd say it for a good measure
To all the ones like you I've known
Ya know I'd like to shave your head
And all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me's a two way street
An all I really want is peace
But my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
No
Affection is a blessing
Can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether
But the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah I know it's hard to face
When all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman
And I'm such a stupid man
But love like time's got its own plans
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
Yeah
If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane
Love's so strange
I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought down in this storm
And left so far out from the shore
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore

No I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought back in this storm
And left so far out from the shore
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore

No, I..
No, I...

Forgive them they teared down my soul
Bless them that they might grow old
And free them so that they may know
That it's never too late

For the many times would seem like a memory
I searched and found the way to choose to the end
I found the ways, why it had to be
Mired in denial and saw all the rain

If we ever find it true
Life we have is made to choose
Free the ball, the chain
We're here together

I'm gonna tell you a story
Stand up for righteousness!
What?
Stand up for justice!
What?
Stand up for truth!
How can a person grow up with all this around them?
You got to call on that something
Where does it come from?
That can make a way out of no way
All this hatred?
What we've got here is..
Fear!
That power that can make a way out of now no way
Failure to communicate
I tell ya I seen the lightning...I've heard the thunder roll!
Everybody's acting like we can do anything and it don't matter what we
Do. Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than
We even know..
Sometimes...
Hatred isn't somethin' you're born with
I feel discouraged
It gets taught
Sometimes I feel discouraged
I felt this fear
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone, no never alone,
No never alone!
Let's get something straight, alright?
Promised never to leave me!
This whole thing was fucked up
Never to leave me alone!
All men betray. All lose heart!
I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe
Black men and white men
Together at the table of brotherhood!
I have a dream
Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty!! WE ARE FREE AT LAST!!



I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought down in this storm
And left so far out from the shore
And I can't find my way back, my way anymore

No I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought back in this storm
And left so far out from the shore
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore
It ain't easy livin' like a gypsy
Tell ya, honey, how it feels
I've been dreamin' floatin' down stream
And losin' touch with all that's real
Whole lotta lover, keepin' undercover
Never knowin' where you been-Oo yeah
You've been fadin', always out paradin'
Keep in touch with mama kin!

You always got your tail on the wag
Spittin' fire from your mouth
Just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon

It ain't easy livin' like you want to
It's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it
You got to say 'shee-it'
But don't forget to drop me a line

Bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for daddy's such a drag
You still stuff your mouth
With his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh no

It ain't easy livin' like you want to
It's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it
You got to say 'shee-it'
But don't forget to drop me a line

Bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for daddy's just a drag
You still stuff your mouth
With his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me
Ohh, ow, ow, ow, yeah! -ow
You pack your bags
And you move to the city
There's somethin' missin' here at home
You fix your hair
And you're lookin' real pretty
It's time to get it out on your own
You're always fightin'
With your mama and you papa
Your family life is one big pain!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
You stole your mama's car
And your daddy's plastic credit card
You're sixteen and you can't get a job
You're not goin' very far
You're always ridin'
With the teachers and the police
This life is much too insane!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma
Time you gotta move
Right to the city
Where the real men get it
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!
You're on the streets
And it ain't so pretty
You need to get a new what you please
You do what you gotta do for the money
At times you end up on your knees!
I'm always buyin'
With the local and the junkies
This city life is one big pain!
But you, you had to move to the city
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma
Time you gotta move
Oh right to the city
With the real nitty gritty
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!
I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin' no
Cause worryin's a waste of my, time
The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine
We been dancin' with
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
I used ta do a little
But a little wouldn't do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'
Ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used ta do a little
But a little wouldn't do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'
Ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
We been dancin' with
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
Now I get up around whenever
I used ta get up on time
But that old man
He's a real muthafucker
Gonna kick him on down the line
Your daddy works in porno
Now that mommy's not around
She used to love her heroin
But now she's underground
So you stay out late at night
And you do your dope for free
Drivin' your friends crazy
With your life's insanity

Well, well, well you just can't tell
Well, well, well my Michelle

Sowin' all your wild oats
In another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday
Maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early
And this hotel wasn't free
So party till your connection call
Honey I'll return the key

Well, well, well you just can't tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Well, well, well you never can tell
Well, well, well my Michelle


Everyone needs love
You know that it's true
Someday you'll find someone
That'll fall in love with you
But oh the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you'll find someone
That you can call your own
But till then ya better

Now you're clean
And so discreet
I won't say a word
But most of all this song is true
Case you haven't heard
So c'mon and stop your cryin'
'Cause we both know money burns
Honey don't stop tryin'
An you'll get what you deserve

Well, well, well you just can't tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Well, well, well you never can tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
You wan'da step into my world
It's a sociopsychotic state of bliss
You've been delayed in the real world
How many times have you hit and missed?
Your cat-scan shows disfiguration
I want to laugh myself to death
With a misfired synapse
With a bent configuration
I'll hold the line while you gasp for breath
You want to talk to me
So talk to me
You want to talk to me (7x)
You can't talk to me
You don't understand your sex
You ain't been mindfucked yet
Let's do it (3x)
Oh my distorted smile
Guess what I'm doing now
(spoken) Is she really going out with him?
Hey!
I got a feeling inside of me,
It's kinda strange, like a stormy sea
I don't know why, I don't know why
I guess these things've gotta be
[Chorus:]
I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
See the sun, see the sunny skies
Don't get too close, it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way
Come back another day
[Chorus:]
I never thought this could happen to me
I'm a strange washing machine
I never served somebody this sane
I'll never, never, never be too late
Hey!
[Repeat first verse]
[Chorus:]
She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big
You know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home
I said nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy!
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin' flat on her back
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made
You know nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!
Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with
A flick and a spoon
And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big
You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
No,no,no,no,no,no,no,no baby
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I bet you mama said
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll'
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys!
Loaded like a freight train
Flyin like an airplane
Feelin like a space brain
One more time tonight
Well I'm a west coast struttin'
One bad mother
Got a rattlesnake suitcase
Under my arm
Said I'm a mean machine
Been drinkin' gasoline
And honey you can make my motor hum
I got one chance left
In a nine live cat
I got a dog eat dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail
With a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with style
An I can tell you honey
You can make my money tonight

Wake up late
Honey put on your clothes
Take your credit card
To the liquor store
That's one for you and
Two for me by tonight
I'll be loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Feelin' like a space brain
One more time tonight

I'm on the nightrain
Bottoms up
I'm on the nightrain
Fill my cup
I'm on the nightrain
Ready to crash and burn
I never learn
I'm on the nightrain
I love that stuff
I'm on the nightrain
I can never get enough
I'm on the nightrain
Never to return-no

Loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Speedin' like a space brain
One more time tonight
I'm on the nightrain
And I'm lookin' for some
I'm on the nightrain
So's I can leave this slum
I'm on the nightrain
And I'm ready to crash and burn

Nightrain
Bottoms up
I'm on the nightrain
Fill my cup
I'm on the nightrain
Whoa yeah
I'm on the nightrain
Love that stuff
I'm on the nightrain
An I can never get enough
Ridin' the nightrain
I guess I
I guess, I guess, I guess
I never learn
On the nightrain
Float me home
Ooh I'm on the nightrain
Ridin' the nightrain
Never to return
Nightrain
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah
But love is always coming and love is always going
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own
Do you need some time all alone
Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time on my
Own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
One, two, one, two, three, four
Yes I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind
Some peace of mind that'll stay 
So I thumbed it, now it's six in L.A.
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way 
Police and niggers, that's right 
Get outta my way
Don't need to buy none of your 
Gold chains today
Now don't need no bracelets 
Clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket 'till then
Won't you cut me some slack
You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much to high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Immigrants and fagots
They make no sense to me
They come to our country 
And think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini-Iran
Or spread some fucking disease
And they talk so many God damn ways
It's all Greek to me
Well some say I'm lazy
And others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy
I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time
Since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to and end I'm 
I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
You're one in a million
You're a shooting star
You're one in a million babe
You know that you are
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much to high
Much too high 
Much too high
Much too high
Radicals and racists
Don't point your finger at me
I'm a small town white boy
Just tryin' to make ends meet
Don't need your religion 
Don't watch that much TV
Just makin' my livin' baby 
Well that's enough for me
You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high

Been hidin' out
And layin' low
It's nothing new ta me
Well you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity
They break down the doors
And they rape my rights but
They won't touch me
They scream and yell
And fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head
I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got somethin'
I been buildin' up inside
For so fuckin' long

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me

Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed
They push me in a corner
Jest to get me to fight but
They won't touch me
They preach and yell
And fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head
I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got somethin'
I been buildin' up inside

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm innocent
They won't break me

Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn't bey that fifth of whiskey
That you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm innocent
They won't break me

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm innocent
So you can
Suck me

Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
Said woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience (Patience)
Mm, yeah
I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know love there's one more thing to consider
Said woman take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said sugar take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, I'll never break it
'Cause I can't take it
Little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah (I've been walking the streets at night, just trying to get it right)
A little patience, yeah (Its hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd)
Could use some patience, yeah (And the streets don't change but maybe the names)
(I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you)
Gotta have more patience, yeah (Yeah, yeah but I need you)
All need some patience (Ooh I need you, whoa I need you)
Just a little patience is all you need (Ooh, this time, ah)
Kickin' back in the shadows
Got no need for the light
Who's sorry now old timer
Look at how you've spent your life
Scroungin' for change
To put some money in your pocket
My how scratch does burn
Laughin' at the fuckers as you piss it away

But I got the time and I got the muscle
I got the need to lay it all on the line
I ain't afraid of your smoke screen hustle
It's a perfect crime
God dammit it's a perfect crime
Mother fucker it's a perfect crime

I said it's perfect

An keep the demons down
And drag the skeletons out
I got a blind man followin' me in chains
I said he's fun to watch
When the world has stopped
An I think he's got somethin' to say
"You want to fuck with me?  Don't fuck with me
'Cause I'm what you'll be, so don't fuck with me
If you had better sense
You'd step aside from the bad side of me
Don't fuck wit da bad side o' me
Stay way from the bad side o' me
Don't fuck wit da bad side"

T minus 1:09 and counting...

Ostracized but that's all right
I was thinkin' about somethin' myself

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Call on everybody who's got last rites
Said it's better
If you locked 'em away
Runnin' through the visions
At the speed of light
Won't ya let me be
Mother fucker just let me be
God dammit better let me be
Don't ya know ya better let me aaahh!

Perfect crime
God dammit it's a a perfect crime
Mother fucker it's a perfect crime
Don't ya know
It's a perfect crime

I know this chick she lives down on Melrose
She ain't satisfied without some pain
Friday night is goin' up inside her...again
Well crack the whip
'Cause that bitch is just insane
I'm serious
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down
I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Once there was this rock n' roll band
Rollin' on the streets
Time went by and it became a joke
We just needed more and more fulfilling... uh-huh
Time went by and it all went up in smoke
But check it out
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down
Ohh I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Once you made that money it costs more now
It might cost a lot more than you'd think
I just found a million dollars
 that someone forgot
It's days like this that push me o'er the brinks
Cool and stressing

She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her

Oh she's the right one ...(etc.)
(but I can tell you a thing or two
 'bout somethin' else
If you really want to know...know what I'm sayin')
Seems like forever and a day

If my intentions are misunderstood
Please be kind
I've done all I should
I won't ask of you
What I would not do
Oh, I saw the damage in you
My fortunate one
The envy of youth

Why would they
Tell me to please those
That laugh in my face
With all of the reasons
They've taught
Fall over themselves
To give way, oh yeah

It's not a question
Whether my heart is true
Streamlined
I had to pull through
Look for a new
Beginning on you
Oh, I, I got a message for you
Up and away
It's what I gotta do
Give what you have
For what you might lose

What would you say
If I told you that I'm to blame?
And what would you do
If I had to deny your name?
Where would you go if I told you
"I love you"
And then walk away? Oh yeah!
N' who should I turn to
If not for the ones
That you would not save? Alright

I told you when I found you
If there were doubts you
Should be careful and unafraid
Now
They surround you
And all that amounts too
Is love that you fed by
Perversion and pain

So if my affections
Are misunderstood
And you decide
I'm up
To no good
Don't ask me to
Enjoy them
Just for you

Ask yourself
What I would choose
To prostitute myself
To live with fortune and shame
Oh yeah!
When you should
Have turned to the hearts
Of the ones
That you could not save, oh now!

I told you when I found you
All that amounts too
Is love that you fed by
Perversion and pain

And you know I know my part
On a holiday, a permanent vacation

Reckless life

     You believe this heat
     Another empty house another dead end street
     Gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell
     This side of heaven this close to Hell
     Right next door to hell
     Why don't you write a letter to me yeah
     I said I'm right next door to hell
     An so many eyes are on me
     Right next door to hell
     I got nowhere else to be
     Right next door to hell
     Feels like the walls are closing in on me
     My mamma never really said much to me
     She was much too young and scared ta be
     Hell "Freud" might say that's what I need
     But all I really ever get is greed
     An most my friends they feel the same
     Hell we don't even have ourselves to blame
     But times are hard and thrills are cheaper
     As your arms get shorter
     Your pockets get deeper
     Right next door to hell
     Why don't you write a letter to me yeah
     I said I'm right next door to hell
     An so many eyes are on me
     Right next door to hell
     I never thought this is where I'd be
     Right next door to hell

     Fuck you
     Bitch
     Not bad kids just stupid ones
     Yeah we thought we'd own the world
     An gettin' used was havin' fun
     I said we're not sad kids just lucid ones yeah
     Flowin' through life not collectin' anyone
     So much out there
     Still so much to see
     Time's too much to handle
     Time's too much for me
     It drives me up the walls
     Drives me out of my mind
     Can you tell me what this means...huh?
If I say I don't need anyone
I can say these things to you
'Cause I can turn on anyone
Just like I've turned on you
I've got a tongue like a razor
A sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors
But then you'll do whatever I like

Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey I ain't naive
Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen oh yeah
I might be too much
But honey you're a bit obscene

I've seen everything imaginable
Pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible
Honey you'd be surprised
I'm a sexual innuendo
In this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything
You better turn me on tonight

Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey I ain't naive
Here I am
And you're a Rocket Queen oh yeah
I might be too much
But honey you're a bit obscene

I see you standin'
Standin' on your own
It's such a lonely place for you
For you to be
If you need a shoulder
Or if you need a friend
I'll be here standing
Until the bitter end
No one needs the sorrow
No one needs the pain
I hate to see you
Walking out there
Out in the rain
So don't chastise me
Or think I, I mean you harm
Of those that take you
Leave you strung out
Much too far
Baby-yeah

Don't ever leave me
Say you'll always be there
All I ever wanted
Was for you
To know that I care
[Chorus:]
Don't you try and stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
'Cause I just won't let you
Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me
Breaking me down with an endless monotony
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me
All things are possible, I am unstoppable
So they convince you no one can break through
I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you
[Chorus:]
Sometimes I feel like my life's a catastrophe
Can't understand why it seems like it has to be
Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me
Nothing's impossible, I am unconquerable
No one can make you do what they want to
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you
[Chorus:]
So they convince you no one can break through
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
I've got a funny feeling there's something wrong today
I've got a funny feeling and it won't go away
I've got an itchy finger and there'll be hell to pay
I'm gonna pull the trigger and blow them all away
Don't ever try to tell me how much you care for me
Don't ever try to tell me how you were there for me
[Chorus]
I don't believe there's a reason (I hope you see this)
I don't believe there's a reason (I don't regret this)
I've got a wicked demon inside that never fades
I've got an empty feeling I won't be home today
Don't ever try to tell me how much you care for me
Don't ever try to tell me how you were there for me
[Chorus: Repeat x2]
I want you to stop and help out with doing what you want to do
No one is guilty here now, there's nothing new now
[Chorus: Repeat x2]
Took my chances carelessly
Choked on my own cigarette
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby
But you ain't seen the worst yet
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
And the woman who is dead
Who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one
And I ain't standing, never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Wrote my changes helplessly
Yeah but I got no regrets
Money it was on the table
So I booked with all the bets
Living like a lemon ain't so hot
And you ain't my idea
Of one high-rollin' shot
No I ain't standing, never standing
Big dark clouds hanging over your head
Hope you've heard, baby all I've said
You've been told, what I've said
No use crying, you're as good as dead
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
And the woman who is dead, who is out alright
Now I'm not the only one
And I ain't standing, never standing
Big dark clouds hanging over your head
Hope you've heard, baby all I've said
You've been told, what I've said
No use crying, you're as good as dead
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
An now you're blowin' smoke 
I think you're one big joke 
Me...I gotta lot to learn 
An I'm still waitin' for the heads to turn 
You say I walk a line 
Fuck they move it every time 
You walk a mile in my shoes 
And then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues 
You get what you pay for 
An freedom's real high priced 
An while your rippin' off children 
Somebody's fuckin' your wife 
It's never made a difference 
It's only how you survive 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
An now you ask me why 
I said it's do or die 
I'll stick it right in your face 
And then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place 
And you...you can suck my ass 
An I think it's so low class 
Me...I'm just so concerned 
I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn 
Ooooh you want a confrontation 
I'll give you every fuckin' chance 
With your verbal masturbation 
Me...I just like to dance 
How's that for provocation 
I'm just makin' a stance 
An I'm tired of the frustration 
Of livin' inside of your lies 
And I'm wired on indignation 
I said somebody's got to die 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't stay here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
Listen motherfucker 
You're about to pay your dues 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
If you're goin' up against me 
Then you know you're gonna lose 
I know 
I know (there's ways- that we- can find) 
I know 
I know 
You think anyone with an I.Q. over fifteen 
Would believe your shit...fuckhead 
Nothin' but a fuckin' pussy
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
And I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
Happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked ol' misery
And she's been here since then
Yeah, we're fucked!
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I, I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, oh yeah!
You like to hurt me you know that you do
You like to think in some way that its me and not you
You like to have me jump and be good, but I don't want to do it
You don't know why I wont act the way you think I should
You thought they'd make me, behave and submit

What were you thinking, cause I don't forget

You don't know why
I wont give in
To hell with the pressure
I'm not caving in
You know that I got under your skin
You sold your soul but I wont let you win
You talk to much
You say I do
Difference is know one cares about you

You've got all the answers
You know everything
Well nobody asked you
Its a mystery to me

I'm sorry for you
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe
I'm sorry for you
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)

You don't know who you can trust now
But you should believe
You should believe
You close your eyes
All well and good
I'll kick your ass like I said that I would
You tell them story's they'd rather believe
Use and confuse them their numb and naive
Truth is the truth hurts don't you agree
Its harder to live with the truth about you
Than to live with the lies about me

Know body owes you
Not one god damn thing
You know where to put your
Just shut up and say

I'm sorry for you

Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)

You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe

I'm sorry for you

Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)

You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free
She's got a smile it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh,
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Oh, oh
Where do we go?
Oh,
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Oh, (sweet child)
Where do we go now?
Oh,
Where do we go now?
Oh,
Where do we go?
Oh,
Where do we go now?
Oh,
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Oh,
Where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child,
Sweet child of mine.
Please allow me to introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
I've been around for a long, long year 
Stole many a man's soul and faith 
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
Had his moment of doubt and pain 
Made damn sure that Pilate 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game 
I stuck around St. Petersberg 
When I saw it was a time for a change 
I killed the Czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 
I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the Blitzkrieg raged 
And the bodies stank 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 
What's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah 
I watched with glee as your kings and queens 
Fought for ten decades 
For the Gods they made 
I shouted out 
"Who killed the Kennedy?" 
When after all 
It was you and me 
So let me please introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
And I laid traps for troubadours 
Who get killed before they reached Bombay 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is just the nature of my game 
Just as every cop is a criminal 
And all the sinners saints 
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer 
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 
So if you meet me 
Have some courtesy 
Have some sympathy, and some taste 
Use all your well-learned politesse?
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh baby 
Oh yeah
Tell me baby, what's my name 
Oh tell me honey, can you guess my name?
Oh oh oh oh
Tell me honey, what's my name 
Oh, just the sweetest, tell me what's my name?
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Oh oh oh)
Can papa get a holler now?
You know you're all alone
Your friends they aren't at home
Everybody's gone to the garden
As you look into the trees
You can look but you don't see
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care
What's it with you man, and this garden
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia
If you're lost no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
You can find it all inside
No need to wrestle with your pride
No you ain't losin' your mind
You're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself
Or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside
For the garden
I wasn't really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering 'round four days
With a smile upon my face
I never want to leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia
If you're lost no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Bye bye
So long, bye bye
It's glad to know ya
Bye bye
Bye bye
Aw...so long
I said baby you been looking real good
You know that I remember when we met
It's funny how I never felt so good 
It's a feeling that I know I know I'll never forget
Oooh it was the best time I can remember
Oooh and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever
There wasn't much in this heart of mine
But there's a little left and babe you found it
It's funny how I never felt so high
It's a feeling that I know I know I'll never forget
Oooh, it was the best time I can remember
Oooh and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever
I think about you
Honey you're the time my heart says 'yes'
I think about you
Deep inside I love you best

You know you're the one I want
I think about you
Darling you're the only one, I think about you...

I think about you
You know that I do
I think about you
All alone only you

Somethin' changed in this heart of mine
And I'm so glad that you showed me
Honey now you're my best friend
I want to stay together 'til the very end
Oooh, it was the best time I can remember
Oooh and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever
I think about you
Honey you're the time my heart says 'yes'
I think about you
Deep inside I love you best
I think about you
You know you're the one I want
I think about you
Darling you're the only one
I think about you (Oh oh yeah)
I think about you (Oh you)
I think about you (Only you you you...)
I think about you (You know I do)
I think about you (Only you)
I think about you
Only you
Only
You

And now I don't know why
She wouldn't say goodbye
But then it seems that I
Had seen it in her eyes

And it might not be wise
I'd still have to try
With all the love I have inside
I can't deny

I just can't let it die
'Cause her heart's just like mine
She holds her pain inside

So if you ask me why
She wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside

There is a special light
Still shining bright
And even on the darkest night
She can't deny

So if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else
Could ever make me feel
I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I've searched the universe
And found myself
Within' her eyes

No matter how I try
They say it's all a lie
So what's the use of my
Confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die
In my heart

So if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else
Could ever make me feel
I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I've searched the universe
And found myself
Within' her eyes

So if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else
Could ever make me feel
I'm so alive

I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I've searched the universe
And found myself
Within' her eyes

And now I don't know why
She wouldn't say goodbye
It just might be that I
Had seen it in her eyes
And now it seems that I
Gave up my ghost of pride
I'll never say goodbye
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I had to put her, six feet under, and I can still hear her complain

I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I knew I'd miss her, so I had to keep her
She's buried right in my back yard

I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
She bitched so much. She drove me nuts, and now I'm happier this way
I used to love her, but I had to kill her, and I can still hear her complain
Welcome to the jungle we've got fun and games

Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted
I bought them for you graceless lady
You know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hand
Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
I watched you suffer
A dull aching pain
Now you're decided
To show me the same
No sweeping exits
Or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter
Or treat you unkind
I know I've dreamed you
A sin n' a lie
I have my freedom
But I don't have much time
Faith has been broken
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living
After we die
Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Yesterday, there was so many things
I was never told
Now that I'm startin' to learn
I feel I'm growin' old
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Time just fades the pages
In my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket
And no hand in destiny
I'll keep on movin' along
With no time to plant my feet
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Some things could be better
If we'd all just let them be
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Got nothin' for me
Yesterday there were so many things
I was never shown
Suddenly this time I found
I'm on the streets and I'm all alone
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday
Yesterday
I tried so hard just to get through to you
But your head's so far
From the realness of truth
Was it just a come on in the dark
Wasn't meant to last long
I think you've worn your welcome honey
I'll just see you along as I sing you this song
Time can pass slowly 
Things always change
Your day's been numbered
And I've read your last page
You was just a temporary love
But honey you ain't the first
Lots of other come before you woman
Said but you been the worst
Said you been the worst
So goodbye to you girl
So long, farewell
I can't hear you cryin'
Your jivin's been hell
So look for me walkin' 
Down your street at night
I'll be in with another
Deep down inside
Deep down inside
It doesn't pay to try
All the smart boys know why
It doesn't mean, I didn't try
I just never know, why
It isn't 'cause I'm all alone
Oh, baby, you're not home
And when I'm home
Big deal, I'm still alone
It's so restless, I am
Beat my head against a pole
Try to knock some sense, down 'side my bones
And even though it don't show
Those guys are so old
[Chorus:]
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try
Don't try
You're just a basket case
And you got no name
Could you live with me?
Go on and say
And even though it don't show
Those guys are so old
Can't put your arms around a memory
[Chorus:]
Johnny you're me
Yeah, you're memory
I want to put my arms around your memory
I can't try, I can't try...don't try
I'm a cold heartbreaker
Fit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake
It's nuthin' new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie too
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin'
And your cocaine tongue
You get nuthin' done
I said you could be mine
Now holidays come and then they go
It's nothin' new today
Collect another memory
When I come home late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin'
And your cocaine tongue
You get nuthin' done
I said you could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine
You've gone sketchin' too many times
Why don't you give it a rest
Why
Must you find
Another reason to cry
While you're breakin' down my back n'
I been rackin' out my brain
It don't matter how we make it
'Cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage
But your flaps are wearin' thin
And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'
But this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers
With ridiculous demands
An you can take the pity so far
But it's more than I can stand
'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older
Tell me how long has it been
'Cause five years is forever
And you haven't grown up yet
You could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin'
And your cocaine tongue
You get nuthin' done
I said you could be
You should be
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine

I try and feel the sunshine
You bring the rain
You try and hold me down
With your complaints
You cry and moan and complain
You whine and tear
Up to my neck in sorrow
The touch you bring
You just don't step inside to, to fourteen years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say, you know
I've been the beggar
I've played the thief
I was the dog, they all tried to beat
But it's been 
Fourteen years of silence
It's been
Fourteen years of pain
It's been
Fourteen years that are gone forever
And I'll never have again, well
Your stupid girlfriends tell you
That I'm to blame
Well, they're all used-up has-beens
Out of the game
This time I'll have the last word
You hear what I say
I tried to see it your way
It won't work today
You don't just step inside to, to fourteen years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say
You know, I've been the dealer hangin' on your street
I was the dog, they all tried to beat
But it's been
Fourteen years of silence
It's been
Fourteen years of pain
It's been
Fourteen years that are gone forever
And I'll never have again, well
Yeah it's been, oh no!
Bullshit and contemplation
Gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth
What would they say?
Well I'm past the point of concern
It's time to play
These last four years of madness
Sure put me straight
You don't get back fourteen years
In just one day
So hard to keep my own head
Just go away
You know, just like a hooker she said
Nothin' is free
Oh I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way
Ain't it fun when you're always on the run
Ain't it fun when you're friends despise what you become
Ain't it fun when you get so high, well that you, you just can't come
Ain't it fun when you know that you gonna die young
It's such fun, good fun, such fun, such fun, aah such fun
Such fun, such fun aah, yeah, fun, such fun, such
Ain't it fun when you're taking care of number one
Oh ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun
Ain't it fun when you just can't seem to find your tongue
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
It's such fun, ah
Well, so good to me, they spit right in my face
And I didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
And I didn't even feel it, it happened so fast
Such fun, such fun, such fun
Ah such fun, such fun, such fun

Tied up, tied down
Up against the wall

Fucking bitch
Diamonds and fast cars
Money to burn
I got my head in the clouds
I got these thoughts to churn
Got my feet in the sand
I got a house on the hill
I got a headache like a mother
Twice the price of my thrills
An it's a cold day,
It's a continental drift
I said this traffic is hell
Can you give me a lift
An I'll try to paint a story
Got your pictures to tell
Yeah you got to make a living
With what you bring yourself to sell
I got some genuine
Imitation
Bad Apples
Free sample
For your peace o' mind
Only $9.95
I got my camera back from customs
Got my law fees up to date
Hell they musta seen me comin'
Ain't this life so fuckin' great
When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand
Yeah, well I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathing while it can
But what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky
Well I would float on by
While everybody's talkin'
Hell I'm just another guy
If it were up to me
I'd say just leave me be
Why let one bad apple
Spoil the whole damn bunch
Gold and caviar
Now why'nt you pour my apathy
I'd have all my bases covered
If I could teach my hands to see
But now we're down in the deep end
Where they'd love to watch you drown
I said your laundry could use washing
We'll hang it up all over town
I said Hollywood's like a dryer
An we're down on Sunset Strip
An you'll be suckin' down the Clorox
'Til your life's all nice and crisp
When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand
Yeah, well I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathing while it can

If it were up to me
I'd say just leave me be
Why let one bad apple
Spoil the whole damn bunch
Why let one bad apple
Spoil the whole damn bunch
Boy!!
I can't stop thinkin'
Thinking 'bout sinkin'
Sinkin' down into my bed
I call my mother
She's just a cunt now
She said I'm sick in the head
She said you ain't special
So who you foolin'
Don't try ta give me a line
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout
Seein' ya one more time
(Oh no)
But I already left you
And you're better off left behind

It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind

Too bad you're fucked up

I used to be wasted
Always tried to take it
Take it down into my vein
I call the doctor
He's just another
He said I'm sick in the brain
He said you ain't special
So who you foolin'
Don't try ta give me a line
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout
Doin' it one more time
(Oh no)
But I already left you
And you're better off left behind
(Oh yeah)

Aw it's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind

So bad...

Boy

It's a
It's a
Heads up
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
Now it's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind

But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout
Doin' it one more time
(Oh no)
See I already left you
And you're better off left behind
(Oh no, oh no)
It's a bad obsession
And you're always messin' my mind
See I already left you
And you're better off left behind
Uh huh...no

Maybe you'll do better next time
Punk!!
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better.

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better.

The hardest part this troubled heart has never
Yet been through now.
We've healed the scars that got their start
Inside someone like you now.

Well had I known or I'd been shown back
When I longed you'd take me.
To break the charge that brought me home
And all that won't erase me.

I never would know that I could
No matter what you'd pay me.
Replay the part, you stole my heart
I should have known you're crazy.

If all I knew was that with you
I'd want someone to save me.
It'd be enough, but just my luck,
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was

Now I know you better,
You know I'd know better,
Now I know you better!

So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution,
This melody inside of me still searches for solution,
A twist of fate, a change of heart,
Kills my infatuation,
A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,

No one ever told me when I was alone,
They just thought I'd know better, better.
Ooh, no one ever told me when I was alone,
They just thought I'd know better, better.
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Well, she's all geared up, walkin' down the street
And I can feel the slime, drippin' down her sleeve
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do

Ooh
Ooh

Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone
And I can hear her boots as she's near her home
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do

Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore
I never should asked for black leather
Black leather
Ooh, black leather
Ow black leather

And you can try to hide, but you won't get far
You can let her in, and you'll start it again
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do

Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore
I never should asked for black leather
Black leather
Ooh, black leather
Ow black leather

Ooh
Ooh
Black leather [x 8]
We all come in from the cold
We come down from the wire
An everybody warms themselves
To a different fire
When sometimes we get burned
You'd think sometime we'd learn
The one you love is the one
That should take you higher
You ain't got no one
You better go back out and find her

Just like children hidin' in a closet
Can't tell what's goin' on outside
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track
We'll get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love
Could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody darlin' sometimes
Bites the hand that feeds

When I look around
Everybody always brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can't see
But there ain't no peace to found
But if someone really cared
Well they'd take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand
Another one's despair
Remember in this game we call life
That no one said it's fair

Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Yeah
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Get down with yo' bad self
Alright

I've come to know the cold
I think of it as home
When there ain't enough of me
To go around
I'd rather be left alone
But if I call you out of habit
I'm out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me
If I fit you needs
Like when we both knew we had it
But now the damage's done
And we're back out on the run
Fun how ev'rything was roses
When we held on to the guns
Just because you're winnin'
Don't mean you're the lucky ones

Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Yeah
Breakdown
Breakdown
Let me hear it now

There goes the Challenger being chased
By the blue blue meanies on wheels
The vicious traffic squad cars are
After our lone driver
The last American hero
The the electric sitar
The demi-god
The super driver of the golden west!
Two nasty nazi cars are close behind
The beautiful lone driver
The police cars are getting closer-closer
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile yeah baby!
They about to strike, they gonna get him, smash! rape!
The last beautiful free soul on this planet

But it is written if the evil spirit
Arms the tiger with claws
Brahman provided wings for the dove
Thus spake the super guru"
"Did you hear that"
Don't you don't you want to thrill me
Don't you be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway
I've been looking for a reject
And you ain't had nothing like me yet
Don't you think it's time for motion
I can take what you've been pushin'
Hey I know what to do
I'm gonna
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck you
Fuck You
Yea I know what to do
I'm gonna
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck you
Fuck you
I'm gonna
I'm the beast and you're the master
You're the meat of the matter
I'm no fool for discretion
When it's on the tip of my tongue
Don't you don't you want to thrill me
Don't you be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway
Hey I know what to do
I'm gonna
Fuck
Fuck

Fuck you
Fuck you
Yea I know what to do
I'm gonna

Hair of the dog
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said "peace could last forever"
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land
And
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
Ow, oh no, no, no, no, no
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no
I don't need one more war
I don't need one more war
No, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no
Whaz so civil 'bout war anyway?
See you've caught me in a coma
And I don't think I want to 
Ever come back to this 
World again
Kinda like it in a coma
'Cause no one's ever gonna
Oh make me come back to this
World again
Now I feel as if I'm floating away
I can't feel the pressure 
And I like it this way
But my body's calling, my body's calling
Want me to come back to this
World again
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I got the light at the end
I got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing
I could leave so easily
My friends are calling back to me
I said yeah,
They're leaving it all up to me when
All I needed was clarity
And someone to tell me what the fuck is going on
Goddammit
Slippin' farther and farther away
It's a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit
Please understand me
I'm climbin' through the wreckage 
Of all my twisted dreams
And this cheap investigation
Just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting
At the crossroads
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Where are you
No one's gonna bother me anymore
No one's gonna mess with my head no more
I can't understand what all the fightin's for
But it's so nice here down off the shore
I wish you could see this 
Cause there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here and its fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live...
Zap him again...
Zap the son of a bitch again
Live your life like it's a coma
Won't you tell me why we'd want to
With all the reasons you give
It's kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason
Why you should stay
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway
I got a one way ticket on your last chance ride
Got a one way ticket to your suicide
Got a one way ticket and there's no way out alive
And all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is 
Then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor
No one else can heal your soul
Got your mind in submission
Got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger
They just stepped aside
They'll be down by the water
While you watch 'em wavin' goodbye
They'll be callin' in the morning
They'll be hanging on the phone
They'll be waitin' for an answer
But you know nobody's home
And when the bells stop ringing
It was nobody's fault but your own
There were always ample warning
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen them coming 
But we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one's listening
Why'd your best friend drop a dime
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a 
Way to spend our time
And it's so easy to be social
It's so easy to be cool
Yeah, its easy to get hungry
When you ain't got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you
With what you hope to find
But I'm still out here waiting
Watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking
Know it's gonna take some time
To heal those broken memories
That another man would need
Just to survive
Here come 'ol flatttop
He come groovin' up slowly
He got ju ju eyball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
He wear no shoeshine
He got toejam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say I know you..you know me
One thing I can tell you is you've got to be free
Come together right now
Over me
He Bag Production, he got
Walrus gumboot, he got
Ono sideboard, he one
Spinal cracker, he got
Feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
Come together right now
Over me
He rollercoaster, he got
Early warning, he got
Muddy Water, he one
Mojo filter, he say
One and one and one is three
Got to be good lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see
Come Together right now
Over me
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Sick of this life
Not that you'd care
I'm not the only one with
Whom these feelings I share

Nobody understands,
Quite why we're here
We're searchin' for answers
That never appear

But maybe if I looked real hard I'd
I'd see your tryin' too
To understand this life,
That we're all goin' through
(Then when she said she was gonna like wreck my car...
I didn't know what to do)

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
Never change

I met an old cowboy
I saw the look in his eyes
Somethin' tells me he's been here before
'Cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child
When the thought first came to me
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son
That brought back the devil in me

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
Never change

I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
Still wet behind the ears
I been around this track a couple o' times
But now the dust is startin' to clear
Oh yeah!!!

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
Ooh yeah, I'd be smilin'
No way I'd be smilin'
Ooh smilin'
Talk to me softly
There's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And please don't cry
I know how you feel inside I've
I've been there before
Somethin's changin' inside you
And don't you know
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
Give me a whisper
And give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you
tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinkin' of you
And the times we had, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
how I felt inside now honey
You gotta make it your own way
But you'll be alright now sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light now baby
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
Baby maybe someday
Don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry
Tonight
Found a head and an arm in da garbage can
Don't know why I'm here
Livin' on the run for oh so long
I gotta go collect
Double talkin' jive
Get the money motherfucker
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin'
I got (Lies)
No more patience man

Back in town an'a all new friends
They sayin' how ya been?
Fucked up and outta place
That's how I felt back then
Double talkin' jive
Get the money motherfucker
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin'
I got (Lies)
No more patience man
You dig what I'm sayin'?
All I need is some inspiration
Before I do somebody some harm
I feel just like a vegetable
Down here on the farm
Nobody comes to see me
Nobody here to turn me on
I ain't even got a lover
Down here on the farm
They told me to get healthy
They told me to get some sun
But boredom eats me like ketchup
Down here on the farm
Drinking lemonade shanty
Ain't no body gonna do me harm
But I'm like a fish out of water
Down here on the farm
I write a thousand letters
'Til my fingers all gone numb
But I never see no postman
Down here on the farm
I call my baby on the telephone
I say come down and have some fun
But she knows what the score is
Down here on the farm
I can't fall in love with a wheat field
I can't fall in love with a barn
When everything smells like horse shit
Down here on the farm
Blue skies and swimming pools
Add so much charm
But I'd rather be back in Soho
Than down here on the farm
On the fucking farm!
Are you born in a fucking barn or what?
Baaaaaa!
He lost his mind today
He left it out back on the highway
On "
"

She loved him yesterday
Yesterday's over
I said okay
That's all right
Time moves on
That's the way
We live an hope to see the next day
That's all right

Sometimes these things they are so easy
Sometimes these things they are so cold
Sometimes these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no man don't let 'em get ta you

She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister
She said O.K.
An that's all right
Buried her things today
Way back out deep
Behind the driveway
And that's all right

Sometimes these women are so easy
Sometimes these women are so cold
Sometimes these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let 'em get to you

Ya get out on your own
And you/take all that you own
And you/forget about your home
And then you're/just fuckin' gone

There's no logic here today
Do as you got to, go your own way
I said that's right
Time's short your life's your own
And in the end
We are just

Dust n' bones
When you're talkin' to yourself
And nobody's home
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone
(Alone)

So nobody ever told you baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to you baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

Old at heart but I'm only twenty eight
And I'm much too young
To let love break my heart
Young at heart but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart

I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
An what more could you ask from me
How could you say that I never needed you
When you took everything
Said you took everything from me

Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

Still talkin' to myself
And nobody's home
(Alone)

So nobody ever told us baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see

When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way
Find another day
With all the changing seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
An now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
You're back down on the ground

And you don't talk so loud
An you don't walk so proud
Any more, and what for

Well I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone
If it doesn't show give it time
To read between the lines

'Cause I see the storm getting closer
And the waves they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die

I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through, this time - oh this time
Without you
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die
It's a critical solution
And the east coast got the blues
It's a mass of confusion
Like the lies they sell to you
You got a glass jawed toothache
Of a mental disease
An they be runnin' round back
See 'em line up on their knees
Cause the kiss ass sycophants
Throwin' penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go
Watch 'em come in off the streets
While they're bangin' out front
Inside their slammin' to the cruch
Go on an throw me to the lions
And the whole damn screamin' bunch
Cause the pissed-off rip-offs
Are' everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's
Ever s'posed to learn
This fire is burnin'
And it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
I read it on a wall
It went straight to my head
It said Dance to the tension
Of a world on edge
We got racial violence
And who'll cast the first stone
And sex is used anyway it can be
Sometimes when I look out
It's hard to see the day
It's a feelin' you can have it
It's not mine to take away
Lost in the garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the garden of Eden
This fire is burnin'
And it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
Suck on that
Looking through this point of view
There's no way I'm gonna fit in
Don't ya tell me what my eyes see
Don't ya tell me who to believe in
I ain't superstitious
But I know when somethin's wrong
I've been draggin' my heels
With a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along
Lost in the garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the garden of Eden
Most organized religions make
A mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous
And out of control
The garden of Eden is just another graveyard
Said if they had someone to buy it
Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul
This fire is burnin'
And it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
Lost in the garden of Eden
(An we ain't talkin' about no poison apple or some missin' rib ya hear)
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
This fire is burnin'
And it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
Why do you look at me when you hate me?
Why should I look at you when you make me hate you too?
I sense a smell of retribution in the air
I don't even understand why the fuck you even care
And I don't need your jealousy yeah
Why drag me down in your misery

And when you stare you don't think I feel it
But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades
When I'm havin' fun ya know I can't conceal it
'cause I know you'd never cut in my game, oh no
And when you're talkin' about a vasectomy, yeah
I'll be writin' down your obituary...history!

You got your bitches with the silicone injections
Crystal meth and yeast infections
Bleached blond hair, collagen lip projections
Who are you to criticize my intentions?
Got your subtle manipulative devices
Just like you I got my vices
I got a thought that would be nice
I'd like to crush your head tight in my vice...pain!!

And that goes for all of you punks in the press
That want to start shit by printin' lies instead of the things we said
That means you andy secher at hit parader, circus magazine
Mick wall at kerrang, bob guccione jr. at spin
What you pissed off 'cause your dad gets more pussy than you?
Fuck you! suck my fuckin' dick!

You be rippin' off the fuckin' kids
While they be payin' their hard earned money to read about the bands they want to know about
Printin' lies, startin' controversy
You want to antagonize me? antagonize me motherfucker!
Get in the ring motherfucker! and I'll kick your bitchy little ass! punk!!

I don't like you, I just hate you
I'm gonna kick your ass, oh yeah! oh yeah!

You may not like our integrity yeah
We built a world out of anarchy oh yeah!

And in this corner, weighing in at 850 pounds; guns n' roses!

Get in the ring(x16)

This song is dedicated to all the guns n' fuckin' roses fans
Who stuck with us through all the fucking shit
And to all those opposed...hmm...well...
All right, take me back hold my hand
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back I want to go back
Take me back and my funky ass band
All the way back to the brotherland take me back (let's go)

How strong is my love? 
How strong is my love? 
How strong is my love? 
How wrong could it be? 
I'll walk a water mile 
Rest a while to kiss your smile 
Laugh and roll and after a while 
I'll begin to like your style 
How strong is my love? 
How wrong could it be? 
She turned me down this time 
She turned me down 
Lord, I can't believe she 
She turned me down 
She turned me inside out 
She turned me down 
All I ask of you 
Is turn me up this time 
[Chorus]
Come on over show me your 
Your glow soul I do adore 
I'll be sure to drop my guard 
Give it up it's not that hard 
Lord, I can't believe she 
She turned me down 
She turned me inside out 
She turned me down 
All I ask of you 
Is turn me up this time
[Chorus]
Tested life but that's alright 
Darker than the darkest night 
Living hell and pollocks at you 
Getting new down your back 
How strong is my love? 
How wrong could it be?

Listenin' to what I said
And try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance and
A chance to make out
Livin' in a citadel
It's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll and
I'm wide awake now
It must have been a hundred miles

Something inside the cards
I know is right
Don't want to live
Somebody else's life
This is what I want to be
And this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time
I could die for you
Oh this life I choose
I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights
These eyes have seen
What I really want to do is
Turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I'd use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then
I'd find a way to share
Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me yo
It's all for free
I could die for you
What you want to do
Oh this life I choose
I could die for you
What you want to do
Oh this life I choose
Come again and tell me
Where you want to go
What it means for me
To be with you alone
Close the door and
No one has to know
How we are
Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me yo
It's all for free
I could die for you
What you want to do
Oh this life I choose
I could die for you
What you want to do
Oh this life I choose
Make me want to say
I could die for you
What you want to do
Oh this life I choose
I could die for you
What you want to do
Oh this life I choose
Told you before, stay away from my door 
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
The freaks on the phone, won't leave me alone 
So don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
No! 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
Now that I showed you what I been through 
Don't take nobody's word what you can do 
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
Now that I found out I know I can cry 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man 
I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa 
They didn't want me so they made me a star 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out!
 
Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you 
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do 
Keep you occupied with pie in the sky 
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all 
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine 
No one can harm you, feel your own pain 
I, I found out! 
I, I found this out! 
I, I found out!
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down, get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
Well, I like dirt, well, I like dirt, well, I like dirt
The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream in your stream
Live in a dream
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down, get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
I like dirt, I like dirt
I like dirt, I like dirt
Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Lets unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go
Well, I like dirt, well, I like dirt, well, I like dirt
Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring
Live in a dream in your spring

And if I had a clue I'd know exactly 
What to do 
If I were the wiser of the two 
And if I saw it all so clear 
I'd write it down and bend your ear 
If I were the clearer of the two 
We could take a walk into the 
Canyons of Fifth avenue 
Sing and dance, just to name a few 
All I do 
All I do 
And if I heard the angels sing I'd 
Sing it back to you and bring the 
Sound of heaven ringing just for you 
And if I saw the sun fall down 
I'd pick it up and make a crown 
One that was a perfect fit for you 
We could take a walk 
Into the apple orchard by the school 
We could make a little residue 
We could find a place to stay 
A secret little hide away 
Spend a little time inside of you 
All I do 
All I do 
All eyes 
All eyes 
All eyes on you 
All I do 
All I do 
All I do 
All I do
A want to be gangster
Thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank
He's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head
Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him in the eye
He's not my kinda guy
Never be
Confusion proof
Pudding's sweet
But too aloof
Orange eye girl
With a backslide dew said
Yo homie
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
And a little lust
To the funky ass flea bass
Most in the race
Just lose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space
Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody want to come get some
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go

Don't ask me why
I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly
In my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on vaudeville
I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle
I saw a star spangled banner yet wave
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
God damn, what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced
Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I wonder why, why
Put us in your pumpkin shell
Where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell
When history books are full of shit
I become the anarchist, I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie, no place for me, I bleed
Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I decide to defy
Kill my trust if you must, but in my blood there is the lust
For life, that's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing through me like a shark
Crashing through the dark
Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I confide, confide
What am I supposed to do, I feel like I'm cut in two
Confused by rules
Do these two cultures clash or am I living in the past?
I ask, please, tell me fast
Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I thats right
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
Be wrong, thats wrong
I took my foot and kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead, forefathers, help me decide
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of adaption and I've got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man
Deep inside the soul hole of mother earth
Father time came with a supersonic supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy but I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone came felonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire from way down down down under
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
Erupting from the ground in Hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete his funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds they make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man it's time to take take take take the throne
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I 
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much too soon
Too much for me too much for you
You're gonna loose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends that you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life, don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie
If you see me getting mighty if you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty if you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away
Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you most every day my love's with you now fly away
If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high
Knock me down

If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high
Knock me down

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
Stiff club, it's my nature,
Custom love is the nomenclature
Turn down mass confusion
Hit the road 'cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision
Long hard look at my last decision
Hustle here, hustle there
Hustle me bitch and you best beware
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you
Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you
Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street life out my window
City-made breeze gonna stroke my skin though
Dropped a lot of words on an old brick wall,
Rob a lot of banks, got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, oh yeah
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna getcha
Move it ah gotta get ya, gonna getcha
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna getcha
Move it ah gotta get ya, gonna getcha
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna getcha
Move it ah gotta get ya, gonna getcha
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna getcha
Move it ah gotta get ya, gonna getcha
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, oh yeah
When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
My love comes, and when it does
It's a crazy kind of
Selective affection
My love flows like a wise guy's tie
In the zanniest of directions
My love protection, my love erection
You better get some of my infection
My love can be-a-bigger than
The hoover dam
My love can hide behind
A grain of sand
My love for life is fueled by
The love for my man
I love his mother and
The silly mystic man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
My love is the Zulu groove
My love is keep it or move
My love is a laughin' boozed
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is gettin' my food
My love, my love
My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a butter knuckle hands
My love for the swedes in the bad
My love for the legs that I spin
My love for the fat mingy
My love, my love
My love is my gross inner self
My love is my dick in my head
My love is my gross inner self
My love is my dick in my head
Loving and touching and
Laughing and Squeezing and
Walking and Joking and
Smiling and Teasing
Loving and kissing and
Rubbing and scrubbing and
Styling and slumming and
Rolling and cumming
I'll hold you a lifetime
I'll love you forever
I'll make you my wife and
I'll never forget you
I'll give you my smile
On the face of your child
I will give you my love
I will give you my love
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Love.
L.A. Lakers fast break makers

Knucklehead suckers better duck

Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
Cause they got more moves
That a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here - pops - then cheers
A roar through the forum
That deafens my ears
The one and only know if his kind
Sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for being bald and bold

All time great super super star

We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights
Just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth
And a pack of style
I say, she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself
Until I'm done, and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars
Make a diagram, and
Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah, hey
Oh yeah
So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind
For the red on rust, I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said
Now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause that's what we do
Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
We are the ones 
That will make you feel better
We are the ones 
That will make you feel better
We are the ones 
That will make you feel better
We are the ones 
That will make you feel better
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Like two sweet peas in an even sweeter pod
That's my friend and my friend's named Bob
Like the devil knows hell I know Bob well
Well enough to tell you 'bout his '67 smells
Well enough to tell you he's a hell-a-swell fellow
Well enough to tell you that we know each other better
Than we know our selves like freaks of a feather we rock together I know Bob well
But I think he knows me better
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
He's as close to me as a friend can be
I'll be standin' by my buddy he'll be standin' by me
Just another half of the two headed freak
But I need him like my heart needs to beat
At this point in this friendly verse
I've got to sing a little something that I haven't rehearsed it's about my man
And his name is Hillel for who my love is soul brother sacred take it huckleberry
Slim boy take it
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Jacky's eyes are closed but he's right on course
Because he's guided by the invisible force
He drives a kooky green Chrysler bad as anybody's Porsche
He's a working class drummer he's as strong as a horse
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Please don't ask me who, 
Or who you think I am
I could live without that, 
I'm just a modest man
Meet me at the corner and, oh
Tell me what to do
'Cause I messed up on you, 
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now,
Receding into the forest 
I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
Please don't ask me where, 
Or where you think I've been
I've been a lot of places 
But this could be my win
Meet me at the corner where I'll 
Tell me what to do
'Cause I messed up on you, 
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now,
Receding into the forest, 
I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know
I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know
Something I wanna show, 
I thought you'd wanna know
Please don't say you want 
To keep in touch I bare 
To see you on the corner 
That I just can't bare
Meet me at the corner and, oh
Tell me what to do
'Cause I messed up on you, 
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest, 
I will lay around and wait
And I turn, I turn my head 
When I thought I saw a sign from the Gods
A sign from the Gods that you were meant to be mine
And it's fine, taking it all for a ride 
Until the day when it's gone
I mystified my way and it all went wrong 
When it's gone
I live and I learn and I lose and I win, 
But it's better than ever, whenever I'm here, 
Thank you girl for everywhere that we've been
Persistent mystic faults my vision
Its like always this point of collision
Its raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
Three pound of love
About to burst
Inside my three pound
Universe
Its raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
Symbols I've been given to express my goal
Always come up short
You know they just don't get that low
Its raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
Bio organic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation
Cleaner than light
Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers
Of suffering succotash
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration,
Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation
I wait
I wait
For the waaaaaave to break.
I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop "yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I can not keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
The I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella
I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things
Good God where's my sleigh
Good God playing for days
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God purple haze
Good God the baddest of brains
Good God any day now
Good God ridin' my sleigh now
Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Copote
Talking about my throughts 'cuase they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch 'cause I lost my housekey
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo
Good God where's my sleigh
Good God playing for days
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God DeNiro's insane
Good God rackin' my brain
Good God anyday now
Good God take me away now take me away
Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things
Things will never be the same
Still I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of scorpios a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know
Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
We're millionaires
Against hunger
I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay
Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, I've got to say
You and I, we're millionaires, 
But we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts, 
And everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize, 
There's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide, 
E've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives
We're millionaires
Against hunger

I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got three or four yachts on the Chesapeake Bay
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay
Well I'm a millionaire too
All I know that is true is that I've got more cash than I can use
I want anything that I can have, 
But I don't need nothin' and I never have
Each damn day my heart's set far, 
But I'll be okay, 'cause I don't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, 
You know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires, 
Every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us learn
We're millionaires
Against hunger
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Nice and wise when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the Grail

The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask and are you up to task?
The catacombs of bet and bone where cultures come to clash
Several of my best friends wear, 
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up, 
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses tonight
The cloth between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears that I am in, the lovely cross to bear
Several of my best friends know, 
The secrets of this town
And Mary wants to raise it up, 
And Sherry wants to spit it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses tonight

The story of love that I'll never taunt you
Hey yeah

Say I will, and then I'll say I want to
The story of love that I'll always want you
Hey
My friends are so depressed
I feel the question
Of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will
Ex girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want, to give her seven years
For being sad
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words, I know of to express
This emptiness
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give, your love
No matter what
Yeah, what she said
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
I used to shout
Across the room to you
And you'd come dancin'
Like a fool
Shuffle step 
You funky mother
Come to me
All warm as covers
Rest with me
My lovely brother
For you see
There is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon
Save me a seat
Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can 
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can
In my room

Ever fill the
The hole you left my man

My lovely man if I can
Standin' on the corner of civilization
There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps
Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home
Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind
Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight
Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Runnin' through the woods laughin' at the blues
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness
Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just want to play
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

She's a witch
A bonafide bore
What's more - she snores
And that is a fact
Cow eyes lie
Yes it's time to resist
How did I ever
Get into this
How could I ever
Have kissed that bitch
So what if she's
Got big tits
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
She came like a cat
Like a cat to cat nap
She came in my lap
With her womanly hips
When I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
A blue blooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
Get the last laugh
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
Like two trains on one track
Bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were
Destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
Like fly by night news
We were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
You and your wack attack
Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
I thought that your love
Was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride
When I realized that
The smack in my bag
And my baseball bat
Was all you were after
Boys "you dirty rat"
She's a bitch and a brat
And a living disaster
She thought she was fast
But I was faster
The freakiest show I know
Is the show of my own
Living my life in and out
Of the twilight zone
Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me
Intercourse with a porpoise
Is a dream for me
Hell bent on inventing 
A new species
Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me
Riding down the path
On the back of a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed
Cause I passed some gas
Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me
Enchanted as a rabbit
That my life is a dream
Well everything is never
Just as it seems
The freakiest show I know
Is the show of my own
Living my life in and out
Of the twilight zone
I've got myself
In a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go
Shake it off
Just to redirect my flow
Come on let's go
Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
And come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
And you always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through
Looking up into
A reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up
Another stubborn scorpio
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
It's really, really you
Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
And come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
And you always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through
Sit up straight

Everything you ever see is never more than you and me

One big mob is home
One big mob is home a broken home
I'd like to share some air with you some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives to give and give
What was I thinking in my head the color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration now
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost a sullen cost

I was riding
Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike
Am I all alone

Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss
Am I all alone
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
If I chase it I might waste it, come and spit it
Am I all alone
Am I all alone
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
Close your eyes and click your heels
Can you believe how good it feels
Am I all alone
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
If I chase it I might waste it come and spit it
Am I all alone
Am I all alone
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
Say goodbye to where you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your mamma, pay your father take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done
Sitting in the fire, I get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher, oh, maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
Oh yeah!
Can you dig it, can you dig it
Welcome friends to my thoughts of when
The 'Fax City Four' were four young men
Time has come, now we jam
With the uplift mofo party plan
We're the organic anti-beat box band
One comes from the holy land
Another was born an Australian
Me I'm from Michigan
But Hollywood is the land of lands
It's a Hollywood jam
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
Life is grand in the land of lands
The mind does boggle the mind expands
The anarchy for have manned their craft
Get on your knees and shake your ass
To the jam that is
We don't ask we demand
That you and your clan
Listen now to this jam
To the power of the drummers bad
It's a Hollywood jam
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
There's a party in my town at 12:00
There's a party that's rockin' down to the rock
I've got nothin' against hip hop
But there's a party in my town
And no beat box jam that is
The party's got girls the girls got hot
The party's got boys and the boys got socks
Something popped the doors unlocked
House got up ran around the block
Sit down house
Take off your blouse
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
Any good friend of the lollipop kids
Over the rainbow with the wiz
We represent the Hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
With the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
It's a Hollywood jam!
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the other side
Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soul mate bled
Push the trigger and I pull the thread, I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on
Take it on
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it's born again
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
How long, I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.
L.A. is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton pickin' maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Like a come on a thumb
Poppin' hump, hump, hump
Pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
'cause I'm shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop
But he never met the Tree so he never be-bopped out hop!
Antwan the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat
And between his legs was a sweat young lass
He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all
By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone
Last night and the night before, I heard a
Fop outside, then I came in doors
Freak out!
Now that I told you a little something about the Flea
A little something about the Tree, a little something about me
I can't leave you hangin' but my man Shermzy, he swings the yang, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his playin', you better be burning Sherman!
We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.
Step out!
Leaving town I found a flower that I could deserve
Someone moves and someone's bound to get their feelings hurt
I'm loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you you're out of range

As I walked out into a world I feel a sudden chill
I was bleeding put it good onto a daffodil
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted to, you're out of range


I don't want too much more than
Than to be reborn
In the morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel you


I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times
Barely there, your voice is crackin' up across state lines
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you, you're out of range

Skies of ecstacy we're breaking well I do believe
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you, you're out of range

I don't want too much more than
Than to be reborn
In the morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel you

I know it hurts when it's taken away
I tell you that I could be living
Today with you or without you, ok
Washed by the rain and it's all gonna change

I don't want too much more than
Than to be reborn
In the morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel you

No sir, not too much more than
Than to be reborn
In the morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel you
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder

Under water where thoughts can breathe Easily
Far away you were made in a sea

Little lune all day

Porcelain, do you carry the moon in your womb
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Nodding and melting and fading away

Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're gonna get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Suckin' on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to funk, funk, funk, funk your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Push it on in and pull it on out
Pump that lemon 'till it pouts
Open your legs to the sensual sound
Let the beauty of the beat pump your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hump the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down
Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good
In my head, as a hellified hum
I take to rubbin' her on the bum
Just a little on the tum
With my thumb i stroke her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like oozing hot cum
Well i like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make her cum, make her cum, cum
Hair so smooth, black as coal
Aw baby the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue 
That you take my blues away
She comes and goes that I know
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist I kiss you lips [sic]
You're my sexy Mexican maid
My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone
When I wake up in the morn
She greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that I's a bright and sunny day
So serene she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say she's my sexy Mexican maid
My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone
She puts me in a bubble bath 
She tickles me and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean 
Then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap 
Upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow
Then we make it fast
My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone
I was not created
In the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary
I prefer a loving god
We are not the center
Of this funny universe
And what is something worse
I do not serve
In fear of such a curse
Shallow be thy game
Two thousand years look in the mirror
You play the game of shame
And tell your people live in fear
A rival to the way you see
The bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival
And your control company
You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I'll be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
To anyone who's listenin'
You're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you
Puke it in the nearest bin
Missionary madness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for the course
It's fucking rude
To think that you're above
The laws of nature is a joke
Purple sashes feeding masses
Smoke on which to choke
I might be a monkey
When it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred
Get down on your knees and
You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I'll be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
Looks to me like heaven sinned
No lullaby kid, no five percent
Any way you want to cut that cake
She's a-dyin' from a life of abandonment
Lost in a valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold
It looked to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in
It's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn no way too much
Shootin' dope in the back of a Cadillac jack
Slow down the road to my back forty
She needs somebody to hold
It looked to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Down in the south sea
Give me your mouthpiece
Resuscitation is the way I find these
I give you majors
You give me minors
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner
Now
Lost in the valley without my horses
No one can tell me what my remorse is
God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold
She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
It looks to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me
She's only eighteen
Don't like the Rollin' Stones
She took a short cut
To bein' fully grown
She got that mood ring
Her little sister, Rose
A smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose
This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette
She said, "My man, you know, it's time to get your fingers wet"
You hustle faster when you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you, why, you were screamin', "Handle it!"
Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share
I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on the lone pine
I'm gonna make you mine
It's understood, you wrap the fool right around my neck
You've got some glitter on ya kitty in the disco tech
I put my lovin' in your oven and I had to check
The last I heard from you a you we're screamin', "Resurrect!"
Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share, ooh
Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share
In a world that can be so insane I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I want to know more than your brain
Into my life you were injected not something that I expected
Now I smile from your affection we have made a soul connection
Just for whom does your bell toll don't be cold show me your soul
Sentimental gentlemen are not afraid to show you when
I am you you're my best friend show me your soul
In a world that can be so insane I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you I want to know more than your brain
Yes I find you so appealing when you show me how you're feeling
You my friend need not be kneeling open up and stop revealing
Trust in me, my heart is whole I need to see show me your soul
Sentimental gentlemen are not afraid to show you when
I am you you're my best friend show me your soul
In a world that can be so insane I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you I want to know more than your brain
Don't expect too much from me Perfection is no test for me
Because the best I'll ever be I just like you, a human being
You won't offend, I need to know
Please my friend Show me your soul
Sentimental gentlemen are not afraid to show you when
I am you you're my best friend show me your soul
(Hey, na, hey, na, na, na hey, na)
A long, long, long, long time ago
Before the wind, before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho
Sir Psycho Sexy that is me
Sometimes I find I need to scream
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go
Deep inside the garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no that would be treason
Believe me Eve she gave good reason
Botty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' 'cause she's the receiver
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that I met 1 time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that left me blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man he's the man he's the man 
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go
I got stopped by a lady cop
In my automobile
She said get out and spead your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said "what's up?" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped "ooh that's tight"
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man that you met 1 time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man that will leave you blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man 
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea
Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mama that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap "snap"
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooh and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while
Flashin' lots of cash and spendin' lots-o-loot
He's sitting at the bar then he's sittin' at the booth
Across the dance floor he does scoot he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
The caboose that could he goes toot toot been known to gag and sometimes puke
A very good friend of granny goose he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit
He's half man and half cartoon
But good buddy don't be confused
He's full blooded Looney Tune
He's a skinny sweaty man, in his green suit, face-to-face with the man in the moon
His family doctor is Doctor Seuss if you catch him in your soup please don't shoot
A skinny sweaty man in his little suit
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit
He was new in town
A freewheelin' clown
A very funny young duke Hangin' under the roof
Of a place in time United sound
He'll play a little guitar, sing a few blues
He's the kind-a-guy that you can't refuse
Despite the fact that he's no brute
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
Strike the magic groove, make him jerk and move
Like an eight legged freak in snake skin boots
Coming soon to a theater near you
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit
Waking up dead inside of my head
Will never never do there is no med
No medicine to take
I've had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I've had a chance to break
It's so bad it's got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say
I know a girl
She worked in a store
She knew not what
Her life was for
She barely knew her name
They tried to tell her
She would never be
As happy as the girl
In the magazine
She bought it with her pay
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Everyone has
So much to say
They talk talk talk
Their lives away
Don't even hesitate
Walking on down
To the burial ground
It's a very old dance
With a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone
Come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
Hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say, oh
When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on?
When it's killing me
When will I really see
All that I need to look inside
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me
What do I really need
All that I need to look inside
Hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and hey oh
Look here what I say oh
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up
I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
Hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh

Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
I said hey, hey, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
I said hey oh yeah, oh yeah
Tell my love now

I've got a bad disease
But from my brain is where I bleed.
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze.

Have turned to demons of greed that's mean.

And it's very sweet.

Take me to the river,
Let me on your shore.
I'll be coming back baby,
I'll be coming back for more.

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad

Bells around Saint Petersburg
When I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find
Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space
And this where I find the way
The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warning
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warning
Pushin' myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now
Alone inside my forest room
And it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start
Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling
Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry

Pushin' myself

Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen
Kind enough to disavow

Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,
Says he's got a bad cough wants to get it paid off
God knows when but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills you only got ten
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but the phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may orders from the D.A. the double D.A
Walk on your tip toes, don't try no doz
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, look out
Looks to me like you did a little to much hittin' kid
You should've took it to the bridge before you started to skid
Look out, kid
The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chillin'em, thrillin'em, and red hot killin'em
Said killin'em
Come on, come on killin'em
Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail
But users, cheaters, six time losers hand around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, look out
Step right up and listen please
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
Everybody gather round all aboard the underground
You've got to get in before you get out
And gettin' out is what it's gonna be about 
If you find that you are blind
Open your bashful mind
Let my band step inside
And take you on a cosmic ride
With honest sounds I'll paint your brain
For in this song I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be 
On this trip you'll ride for free
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus
Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw be my quest inside my grove
Cause what I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus
Take your body shake it around
Do the dog on the ground
And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have to make you piss your pants
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus
Should of been, could of been
Would of been dead

I need relief
Do you want me girl
To be your thief
Aw baby just for you

K-i-s-s-i-n-g

Kiss me please pervert me stick with this
Is she talking dirty
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss
Flat on my back In a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling Because I can not fall
Asleep tonight 
No not at all
Head lights flash Across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open Because I can not fall
In love with you, I know not at all
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid
Busted in two Like a brittle stick
I can not drink
Because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream and no I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid
Yeah, yeah
This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
I am not alive
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid
Oh oh how the price gets paid
Well I got to pay, I got to pay the price
I think I'll walk away
'Cause I couldn't survey, I couldn't pay
I couldn't price
This is my time
This is my tear
I can see clearly now
That this is not a place
For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time
This is my tear
Comin' on strong
Baudelaire
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime
All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
Devil may cry devil may care
Distiller's got a scream
And now I know just why
When she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time
California skies
Got room to spare
This is my time
All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
Oh never know
Take it outside
Take it out there
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time
All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
Oh never know
Could you turn up the track a little bit, please
My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth would not be true
Refuse the news
I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I supposed to do
Just lose and lose
First time I saw you
You were sitting backstage in a dress
A perfect mess
You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
I liked your whiskers
And I liked the dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes
You painted pictures
'Cause the one who hurts can give so much
You gave me such
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
'Cause I'm so afraid
That we will have to part

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

One day, I feel so happy
Next day, I feel so sad
I guess, I'll learn to take
The good with the bad

'Cause each night
I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear for nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through

Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear for nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through

Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye
'Cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody
Lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where do you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty, baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life could be a little sweet
But life could be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas city
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fitty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Lipstick junkie
Debunked the all in one
She came back wearing a smile
Looking like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one here is on trial
It's just a turnaround
And we go, oh
Well then we go uh huh huh oh
Tick-tock I want to rock you
Like the 80s
Cock blocking isn't allowed
Tugboat Sheila is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd
We better get it on the go
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
How Maggie makes it in her cloud
I said hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
Rain dance Maggie
Advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods
Little did I know
Her body was one
Delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
How Maggie makes it in her cloud
We've got the wrong girl
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone girl
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
How Maggie makes it in her cloud
I said hey now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone bye bye bye yeah
Bye bye bye girl
Bye bye girl
Bye bye girl
Bye bye
Give it up to this planet full of strife we're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap the cups went up like a natural fact
It was our shoulder space that made the perfect place
For the magic of the cup to style out with grace
With a tight turn twist and a slight swerve swank
The brothers cup kissed with a kick ass clank
We are the brothers cup we like to get it up
We are the brothers cup we like to get it up
Give it up to this planet full of strife we're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap the cups went up like a natural fact
So love all your brothers and love all your sisters
Love all the misses and love all the misters
Don't be shy when you're sharin' your kisses
The brothers cup kiss and we ain't sissies
(We're the brothers cup)
(We're the brothers cup)
(We're the brothers cup)
(We're the brothers cup)
(We're the brothers cup)
Get it
Do it
Do it, alright, keep it, keep it
It is our notion that the perfect peace potion can be found in the wake of the green sea's motion
The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean is the cradle of peace it's the perfect peace motion
Give it up to this planet full of strife we're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the power of the cup we are about to astound all your preconceptions they will come unbound
We are the brothers cup coming to your town bringing tubs of love we're going to spread it around
(We're the brothers cup)
(We're the brothers cup)
(We're the brothers cup) we like to get it up
(We're the brothers cup) we like to get it up
(We're the brothers cup) we like to get it up
Drivin' around I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love
Makin' my way I brake another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love
Who, you talking to, talk to me you
Sound of music
Who, you talking to, talk to me you
Sound of music
I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me
Sought and I found a life of makin my blood sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound the face of God is in Sensurround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love
Who, you talking to, talk to me you
Sound of music
Who, you talking to, talk to me you
Sound of music
I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me
Woke up this morning like I always do
I still like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay
Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea
I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay
Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea
The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea
I've got a soul that can not sleep
At night when something just ain't right
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red black or white, this is my fight
Come on courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into words
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality
Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
Media chief, you menance me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality
I've got tapes
I've got c.d.'s
I've got my Public Enemy
My lilly white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
Never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality
Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget, cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick, little piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick, eat my thickness
I've got a welt from the Bible belt
Dealing with the hand that I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist
Giving up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
No I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot
Little brother do you hear me
Have a heart oh come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity
I can't rest in war
Will you be my friend?
Dark ages never change
Well, I can't comprehend
Kiss me, we self destruct
Can you hear me, Lord?
Yes, I think we're fucked
But I can't rest in war
Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
I am playing for a better day
Playing for a better day, anyway
Oh yeah, I'm playing for a better day
Holy Mother Earth
Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face
I thought she had been raped
Killing your future blood
Fill her with disease
Global abortion pleas
That is what she needs
Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
And I am playing for a better day
Oh yeah, playing for a better day
Anyway
Are we fire flies
Flashing in the night?
Big thunder rumble fish
But did you get it right?
Headstrong 'bout this song
Exploding souls, be gone
Marvin Gaye, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
Well, I am playing for a better day
Can I get your hand to write on
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on
Take a look
It's on display for you
Coming down
No, not today
Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pick it up
If not too strong for you
Take a piece
And pass it on
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look
It's on display for you
Coming down
No, not today
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We'll find a place together
(Whoa) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - do you
(Yeah) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Whoa) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - want to
(Yeah) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We're gonna live forever
Forever

Dirty earthworms
Boy he was
Disturbed
Close to my skin

Sittin' by the phone
I'm left alone in another zone
John says to live above hell
My will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail
My will could sail yeah
It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste of being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything 
I will for you
Sailin' for the sun'cause there is one
Knows where I'm from
I care for you I really do I really do
Come closer now
So you can lie right by my side
Sit alone in the sun I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself, yeah
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything 
I will for you
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
Close to my skin someone who's been
I'm a falling in
Disasters are just another star
Falling in my yard
John says to live above hell
My will is well
Long to be with someone to tell
I love your smell
Throw away your television
Time to make this clean decision
Master waits for it's collision now
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old
Throw away your television
Make a break big intermission
Recreate your super vision now
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old
Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now
Oh oh oh
Throw away your television
Take the noose off your ambition
Reinvent your intuition now
It's a repeat of a story told

Time
I was walking 
Through a courtyard
Without shoes and 
Without regard 
Automatic catacombs
Take me where I want to go 
All around 
All in faces 
It astounds 
And amazes 
Good to last innatural 
Touch me I'm a chromosome 
What time 
Fascinated by the face of time 
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
Time 
Ultra-fine and ultralistic 
Can I spy into the mystic 
System down for infiltration 
Open mind free of frustration 
I was driving 
To a safe place 
And arriving
As I retraced 
Yell into a telescope 
Aim it at the star of hope 
What time 
Fascinated by the face of time
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
Time 
All over the under 
The smell of blood and thunder 
I'm connected by the lightning rod
Giving into the beauty and 
Heaven knows how well I know you

Time
Here's a song
Here's a little punk rock song for you
A little punk rock called
I think it was written by the Ramones

In the early 70's
Maybe before they started
You know, when it was really hard core back in the old days
Remember?

Flea
I could have sworn this was the Dead Kennedy's
No, no, no, no, no
I think it was Sham 69
No, this is the Buzzcocks

You idiot, you worthless peon
Don't you know this is one of the
It must have been, um
The Sex Pistols

No, this is non, non, non
Hey, it was the Church or the Weirdoz maybe

Hold me closer tiny dancer
I count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You've had a busy day today, woah

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You've had a busy day today, woah
Because I'm happy to be sad
I want it all I want it bad
Oh oh
It's what I know
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
Let's go, oh
It's what I know
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me please
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin' me so torture me please
All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go
It's what I know
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me please
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin' me so torture me please
The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill
Let's go
Let's turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound
Is so
All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
It's so
Torture me and torture me

You are my god, you are my dog
You kept me close, love never lost
I called you hippie, you said fuck off
Said your brother's a real punk rocker
Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me oh over the moon
Friends near death, you gave respect
Sympathetic intellect
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall (that's all)
Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you
Round and round inside your head
Smartest fucker I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul
Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me over the moon
Mule donkey ass you bore the load
Of all creations tortured souls
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall
(Like no other, I love you your my brother)
Water flowing and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood, will never be understood
Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey mother may I have lost a child
But she gave birth
To a loving stream
Oh, never know
When the gods will come and take you
To a loving stream
Oh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me were
From your loving stream
In a loving stream
Fuck the magazines
Fuck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream
Fuck the legal greed
Fuck the nothing scene
See the family
In a loving stream
Hoo, Lord 
Well, I'm gonna ride a saber tooth horse through the Hollywood hills

Some of us get a little
And some a lot
We've got to make due
With what ever we got
We get it hot we cool it down
And then we pass it around
You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
It's turning night into day
Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you
I turn into
And then I turn it again
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt
We turn it out
And then we turn it again, woo
I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get a beat and then
I turn it to ten
Lace boots and the
Ladies of Kazakhstan
Kick 'em high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba
Then Aruba then the Dominican
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you
I turn into
And then I turn it again
Here we go (two things I want to say now)
All we know
Heavy load (you make it all okay now)
Start to float
Without a doubt (I need to know that you are there)
We turn it out 
And then we turn it again
We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh
I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek
I turn a key
And then I turn it for free
We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling dervish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around
A robot
Doin' the astronaut
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you
I turn into
And then I turn it again
Here we go (two things I want to say now)
All we know
Heavy load (you make it all okay now)
Start to float
Without a doubt (I need to know that you are there)
We turn it out 
And then we turn it again
Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way (yeah yeah)
It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way (yeah yeah)
Ooh no (no no yeah yeah)
Love me I say yeah yeah
Under the bridge downtown
Is were I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away (yeah yeah)
Ooh no (no no yeah yeah)
Here I stay yeah yeah
Here I stay
I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still I so admired
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me she wolf style
Rip right through me
Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw love stream flow
Come on baby 'cause, there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better then love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run
I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight
Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put I saw love stream flow
Come on baby 'cause, there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for

Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Does it go from east to west 
Body free and a body less 
Come again just to start a fresh 
Once again to find a home 
In the moment of the meantime 
Dropping in coming through the mesh 
Checking in just to get it blessed 
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam 
Where you come from 
Where you going 
Where you come from 
Where you going 
Do it all then it all again 
Make it up and you make a friend 
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see 
All the mamas and the papas 
Take a chance on a recommend 
Hard as hell just to comprehend 
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze 
Where you come from 
Where you going 
Where you come from 
Where you going 
We all want to tell her 
Tell her that we love her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever seen 
We all want to kiss her 
Tell her that we miss her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever 
I know you said you don't believe 
In God do you still disagree 
Now that it's time for you to leave 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend
Your stylish mess of silver hair 
A woman of your kind is rare 
Your uniform returns to air 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend
And now it's time for you to go 
You taught me most of what I know 
Where would I be without you Glo 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend
I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be 
A kiss goodbye before you leave 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend
My friend
My friend
I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet
A detective of perspective
I need to try and get a bigger eye, open wide
Blood wood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
To me now
On a walkabout
You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in the desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout
High desert skies, are what I spy
So fly, you've got to wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear
The digeridoo original, man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout
You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout
A walk could cure almost all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One, two
I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about, can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round up
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing a song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
And if you float you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
Slight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
Slight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt

Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent

Easy living, easy hold
Easy teething, easy fold
Easy listening, easy love
Easy answers to easy questions
Easy tumble, easy doll
Easy rumble, easy fall
I get up on easy love
I get up on easy questions
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?

This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
The white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You
And in your life, there comes the darkness
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Now we're trapped, we're dark cloud's people
We are helpless to resist
In your darkest hour
But it was just a lie, just a lie
Just a lie, just a lie
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
Still turning heads, you know where it's at
This dread still covers us
You gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, and it's dark now
It was just a laugh, it was just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
Split infinite
And in your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard
In your darkest hour
If you had another one
If you had another name
So dark
We will never, never know
We will never, never know
So dark

I've had these jeans since I was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards
I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But mom and dad will not give in
And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
And now I know just what it is
It's called disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide
Too scared too talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye
And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
Wears him out
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
One two three four
Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall
Like domino's
In pretty patterns
Fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel now
What you ought to, what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible
Dead from the neck up
Because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
For no real reason
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
Take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel now
What you ought to
What you ought to
An elephant thats in the room is
Tumbling tumbling tumbling
In duplicate and duplicate
Plastic bags and
Duplicate and triplicate
Dead from the neck up
Guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough is enough is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough
A last stop
There's no real reason
Fitter, happier
More productive
Comfortable
Not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car, baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace, slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves

Somethings will never wash away

Hey it's me
I just got off the train
A frightening place
Their faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket
Panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great job, no message coming in
And you're so small
Glassy eyed light of day

The path trails off

Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop

Kill yourself to never ever stop

They're the once who'll spit at you
You'll be the one screaming out

And this just feels like spinning plates
My body is floating down the muddy river
Turn to nasty now
The dark cell
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke this spell
Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease
And you're such a flirt
Once you've been hurt
You've been around enough
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get earnest
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look
Your clue on hold, snapped up
Crawling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one that broke the seal
Obligation
Complication
Routines and schedules
Drug and kill you
Kill you
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get nervous
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look
Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease
And you're such a flirt
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me off
And cut me off
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to fill your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird lights float into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
I am gone
Everybody's waiting
And these fruit
Just a twist of poison
I won't be alone
When you're running in me
I can't stay
Like I'm somewhere always
I need more
A restless body cracks and rolls
I won't have the strength
When you're running in me
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
The head of state has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
We are standing on the edge
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
The head of state has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
We are standing on the edge
You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension 
The stress and the tension
I'm in a lull
There's nothing more dull
Than talkin', talkin' 'bout yourself
But what I meant to say
I'm sorry that I lost control 
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
Crawling through the keyhole
I'm in a lull
You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control

I feel better, 
I feel better now you've gone 
I got better, 
I got better, I got strong 
I feel better, 
I feel better, now there's nothing wrong 
I got better, 
I got better, I got strong 
Tell me something, 
Tell me something I don't know 
Tell me one thing, 
Tell me one thing, let it go 
I got something, 
I got something heaven knows 
I got something, 
I got something I don't know
Drift all you like
From ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions
And hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone
When you come home
I'll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me
Dressed for the kill
You're my man of war
You're my man of war
And the worms will come for you
Big Boots
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So unplug the phones
Stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
From poisoned clouds
To poisoned dwarf
You're my man of war
You're my man of war
And the worms will come for you
Big Boots
Yeah the worms will come for you
Big Boots
For you
Big Boots
Here it comes, Here it comes,
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully
Burning up the freeway
Here it comes
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful gets into beautiful trouble
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you.
Oh baby burn
Fast die younger
Burns rubber
Useless rockers
From England
Good times
Had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your crutches
Blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal
Interstate fire walk staright down the middle,
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby burn
Don't
Forget
That you are our son
Now
Go back to bed
We just know
That you are ours
You won't cry
Too hard
Death
To all
Who stand in your way
My arm, you
Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday..
Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no-one's listening anyway
Just trying to bribe me..
And if it's alright, then what am I doing here?
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man
Today I wrote a bad check
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no-one's looking anyway
I hope they miss me
I just think maybe I'm making a mistake.
Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release me
Release me
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around around around around
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
A glass, a gun, a bullet for us will make
Everybody wants to be a ?
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen from my life support
My iron lung
We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are loosing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
Iron lung
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out we'll just hum
This this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung
If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay 
If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said "I've been where I like"
"I've slept with who I liked"
"She ate me up for breakfast"
"She screwed me in a vice"
"But now
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied"
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and a-salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why
I feel
So skinned alive.
Like my thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
Yeah no one likes a smartarse but we all like stars
That wasn't my intention (tension), I did it for a reason (treason)
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
They love me like I was their brother
They protect me
Listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine
Made me happy
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
I call up my friend the good angel
But she's out with
Her answer-phone
She says she'd love to come help but
The sea would
Electrocute us all
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough
Now come home
Now come home
Now come home
Now come home
Nice dream

A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Nothing touches me, man
These walls are three feet thick
Wouldn't take one of them
Little drills to get through it
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
She went
Nothing touches me
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me, man
No matter how you split
Sticks and stones can get through bones
So I've given up looking out of it
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
She went
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now

Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
There'll be something missing
And now that you found it
It's gone
Now you feel it you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to Hell
For what your
Dirty mind is thinking
Flies are buzzing round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can?
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can

This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on animal farm
You can try the best you can

It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy, everyone is made for life
In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space

You're too busy to wait
But I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay too
Every one one of those days
When the sky's California blue
With a beautiful bombshell I throw myself into my work
I'm too lazy, been kidding myself for so long
I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay too

The sweetest flowers and fruits are hanging from trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word
Every gesture
And my heart, in my mouth
Like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
I was just your number
I want stay on it
And get back under
And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
Like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
When at last you'll give in
When at last you'll give in
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
sit down, stand up
sit down, stand up 
walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up) 
anytime (sit down) 
anytime (stand up)

sit down, stand up
we can wipe you out anytime (sit down, stand up)
we can wipe you out (sit down, stand up)
anytime (sit down)
anytime
stand up (the rain drops the rain drops)
sit down (the rain drops the rain drops)
oh
the rain drops x46
I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rappin' upon my windowsill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up sktterbrain
Any fool can easy pick a hole
I only wish I could fall in

A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere I'm not sktterbrain
Somewhere I'm not sktterbrain
Lightning fuse, power cut, sktterbrain
I walk down the staircase, 
Magnetic pull.
Back to the other place
That I cannot go.
I'm sending a chopper, 
To steal you away.
The pot is full, 
Let me take control, 
Let me take control.
The pot is full
Of secrets to be told, 
Secrets to be told.
Out of orbit
And I always will.
The pot is full, 
Let me take control, 
Let me take control.
The pot is full
Of secrets to be told, 
Secrets to be told
And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice 
And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me 
And they won't let me be 
There's nothing to say 
And there's nothing to do 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
And my mother say we don't't love you son some more
And the buildings say let me spit on your face some more
And the feeling is 
That there's something wrong 
'Cause I can't find the words 
And I can't find the song 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Dear sir, I have a complaint 
Dear sir, I have a complaint 
Can't remember what it is 
Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter anyway
Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop whispering, stop whispering, start shouting
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
Fade out again
Fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
I find it hard
To drive your stupid car
I find it hard
Cause I never get that far
And you put my brain in overload
And I can't change gears
I cannot see the road
You got concrete eyes
And I cannot see your face
And I failed in life
Cause you crushed me with your hands
And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gears
I cannot see the road
When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
What do you think you'll do then
I bet they shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
Ferryboat Bill, won't you please come home?
You know your wife has married a midget's son,
And that's the short and long of it.
She's over by the corner
Got her hands by her sides
They hit her harder harder harder
Till they thought she might die
Well I got a foggy notion, 
Do it again
Over by the corner, 
Do it again
I got my calamine lotion baby, 
Do it again
I got a foggy notion, 
Do it again
She made me do something 
That I never did before
I rushed right down 
To a flower store
I bought her a bundle 
A beautiful batch
Don't you know something, 
She sent 'em right back
Sally Mae, Sally Mae, 
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae, 
Sally Mae, Sally Mae

I find it's hard to lose
Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love
Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love
Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love
My mama told me, ever since I was seven,
Hold your head up high.
My parents toldmy ever since I was eleven,
"Hold your head up high."
They said the answer was to become a dancer,
Hold your head high.
Oh, just like I figured, they're always disfigured
With their heads up high.
Now I'm older, I'm getting so much bolder
With my head up high
Oh, as I figured, just like I figured
Since your head's up high, baby.
Oh, just like I figured,
You know, they was disfigured
Hold your head up high.
You know, they says the answer was to become a dancer
Hold your head high, boy.
Ever since I was a baby on my mama's knee,
Oh, just listened to what everybody told me,
Oh yes I did. But still the answer was to become a dancer,
And hold your head high,
But, just like I figured, they're always disfigured,
They hold their heads up high, Watch out!
Do the dog! Oh, watch out!
And now I'm older, they say I'm so much bolder
Got your head up high.
Oh, and the answer was, hey, to become a dancer,
Head up high.
Well, but just like I figured, they're always disfigured
They got their heads up high.
But the answer was, now, boy, to become a dancer
With your head up high
Head up high,
Head up high...
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now...
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now...
Ah oh, it looks so good
Ah oh, she's made out of wood
Just look and see
Oh, it's made out of wood
Just look and see now
She ever comes, she ever comes now
Now, now, now, now
She ever, ever, ever comes n-n-n-now...
I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you things aren't quite the same

When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death

You can't help me now, you guys
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
On a sailor's suit and cap

Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
Because a mainline into my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead

Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
And all the politicians making crazy sounds
And everybody putting everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

'Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care anymore
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
And thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
Oh, and I guess I just don't know
Three, four

Stayin up in the sky
I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too
You held up a stage coach in the rain
And I'm doing the same
So you're hanging from a tree
And I made believe it was me
I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too
People going to the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the cong?
But with you by my side I can do anything
When we swing
We hang past right or wrong
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me too
I'll do anything for you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you
It's hard being a man
Living in a garbage pail
My landlady called me up, oh
She tried to hit me with a mop
I can't stand it any more more
I can't stand it any more more, oh
I can't stand it any more more
But if baby would just come back, it'd be all right
Yeah, if baby would just come back, it would be all right
Come on, baby
I live with thirteen dead cats
A purple dog that wears spats
They're all living out in the hall
And I can't stand it any more
I can't stand it any more more
I can't stand it any more more
I can't stand it any more more
But if baby would just come back, it'd be all right
Oh, if baby would just come back, it would be all right
Be all right, now
Come on, baby
I'm tired of living all alone, yeah
Nobody ever calls me on the phone
But when things are getting better
I just play my music louder
I can't stand it any more more
I can't stand it any more more
I can't stand it any more more
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it ...
Pa papa papa papa

I found a reason to keep living
Oh and the reason, dear, is you
I found a reason to keep singing

Oh I do believe
If you don't like things you live
For some place you never gone before
Pa papa papa papa
Pa papa papa papa
Pa papa papa papa

Honey, I found a reason to keep living
And you know the reason, dear it's you
And I've walked down life's lonely highways
Hand in hand with myself
And I realized how many paths have crossed between us
Oh I do believe
You're all what you perceive
What come is better that what came before
Oh I do believe
You're all what you perceive

Here she comes now, now
Gone, gone, gone
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
Got my eyes wide open
Ever since I was on cripples Monday
Got my eyeballs on my knees, Aww my baby walkin'
After hours with Mad Mary Williams
Said she never understood a word from me, because...
I know that she cares about me
I heard her call my name
And I know that she's long dead and gone
Still she ain't the same
When I wake up in the morning mama
I heard her call my name
I know that she's gone, gone, gone
I heard her call my name
And then my mind split open...
When I think of all the things I've done
And I know that it's only just begun
Those smiling faces
You know, I just can't forget them
But I love you
When I think of all the things I've seen
And I know that it's only the beginning
You know, those smiling faces
I just can't forget them
But for now I love you
Just for a little while
Oh baby, just to see you smile
Just for a little while
When I think of all the things I've done
And I know, that it's only just begun
Oh, smiling faces, Jesus
You know, I can't forget them
But for now, I love you
Watch this minute, baby
Now I love you
At least for now
I love you
I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
The light on your door to show that you're home

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

I find it hard to believe you don't know
The beauty you are
But if you don't let me be your eyes
A hand to your darkness, so you won't be afraid

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

I'll be your mirror
I'll be your mirror
I'll be your mirror
I'll be your mirror
I'll be your mirror
You will search, babe, at any cost,
But how long, babe, can you search for what's not lost ?
Everybody will help you,
Some people are very kind.
But if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me,
I'll keep it with mine.
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
If I say I'm not loving you for what you are
But for what you're not.
Everybody will help you,
Discover what you set out to find
But if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me,

Still stuck on the line.

Come on, give it to me,

If you think that it's all good
You know what you'll have to do

Without you I ain't gonna be waitin'
You're not a hesitating, here it comes

I'm not too sorry
Now, that you're gone
I don't think, I'll miss you

If you know that it's not right
That I'll see you some other night
But if you want it when you're gone
You'll find yourself another one

So now, okay
Worry, it's around

I'm not sorry that you're gone
I don't think, I'm sorry
'Cause I found a new one
It wouldn't break my heart
It wouldn't make it hard to go around
I've been set free and I've been bound
To the memories of yesterday's clouds
I've been set free and I've been bound
And now I'm set free
I'm set free

I've been blinded but
You I can see
What in the world has happened to me
The prince of stories who walk right by me
And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion
I've been set free and I've been bound
Let me tell you people
What I found
I saw my head laughing
Rolling on the ground
And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion

It was a pleasure then
Could you just be here again
To know what there was to see
When all the Sunday people
Where so quiet in the dark
Afraid to be better the next day
La la la ...
It was a pleasure then
When we could sit and stare again
Until the stars feel 
through the cloudy trees
Onto the grass
Stars to smile with us
Until they too had tears in their eyes
Tell us this and tell of how much 
we must not agree
It was a pleasure then
To see the dying days again
In the horror of the night
Never, never, never, never, never, lise
Keep it secret
For to hide somewhere at last
As long as we could see
The sky confessed this crime
Of futile tasting hate romance
Above our shattered minds
It was a pleasure, It was a pleasure
La la la ...

Lady Godiva here dressed so demurely
Pats the head of another curly haired boy, just another toy
Sick with silence she weeps sincerely
Saying word that have oh so clearly been said
So long ago
Draperies wrapped gently 'round her shoulder
Life has made her that much bolder now
That she's found out how
Dressed in silk, Latin lace and envy
Pride and joy of the latest penny faire
Pretty passing care
Hair today now dipped in the water
Making love to every poor daughter's son
Isn't it fun
Now today propping grace with envy
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
And hasn't a care
Doctor is coming the nurse thinks sweetly
Turning on the machines that neatly pump air
The body lies bare
Shaved and hairless what once was screaming
Now lies silent and almost sleeping
The brain must have gone away
Strapped securely to the white table
Ether caused the body to wither and writhe
Underneath the white light
Doctor arrives with knife and baggage
Sees the growth as just so much cabbage
That now
Must be cut away
Now come the moment of Great! Great! Decision!
The doctor is making his first incision
One goes here - one goes there
The ether tube's leaking says someone who's sloppy
The patient it seems is not so well sleeping
The screams echo up the hall
Don't panic someone give him pentathol instantly
Doctor removes his blade
Cagily slow from the brain
By my count of ten
The head won't move
Lisa says that it's all right
When she meets me at midnight
Lisa says that she has her fun
And she'll do it with just about anyone

Lisa says that she's on the run
Looking for a special one
Lisa says that every time she makes it straight
She knows her heart will break
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Looking for a party, some action
Gone to make it feel okay
But what do you mind, where the time must come on down
Look at it all

Oh, Lisa says

Little Sister
(John Cale, Lou Reed)
Don't call me home, little sister
Before the night is done
My love and I are fleeing
Running into the sun.
Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well.
Take up all your jewels and gold,
Bury them away in the earth.
Let your memory reduce them to dust
But don't forget the knife that was thrust.
Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well.
Frozen kiss by the fountain
Running into the sea
Where shadows choose their horrors
Designed for music.
Turn to fly, go away,
Little bird, please don't stay,
Fare thee well.

Only proves you're my best friend

Some kinda love
Margarita told Tom
Between thought and expression
Lies a lifetime
Situations arise
Because of the weather
And no kinds of love
Are better than others
Some kinda love
Margarita told Tom
Like a dirty French novel
Combines the absurd with the vulgar
And some kinds of love
The possibilities are endless
And for me to miss one
Would seem to be groundless
Mmm-hmm, oh yeah
"I heard what you said"
And Margarita heard Tom
And of course you're a bore
But in that you're not charmless
'Cause a bore is a straight line
That finds a wealth in division

Ooh, are mistaken for vision, la-dee-da-da-dah
Ooh
Put jelly on your shoulder
Let us do what you fear most
Hmm, that, from which you recoil
But which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder, baby
Lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression
Let us now kiss the culprit, move it on, ooh
I don't know, just what it's all about
Tell you something, honey
But put on your red pajamas and find out
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ooh, Lord rock it on

Hmm, oooh
Love and learn
Take your turn
Somewhere there's a feather
Falling slowly from the sky
You need not know the reason why.
Stand apart
Hear your heart
Someday there will be
Another lover till the end
You need not hold your breath till then.
Don't ask me to explain to you
There's nothing to remain but what we see.
Fall and climb
Take your time
Somehow you must live up
To the precedents you've set
You need not hope for answers yet.
Don't ask me how I know it now
The future does not show itself to me.
So love and learn
Take your turn
Somewhere there's a feather
Falling slowly from the sky
You need not know the reason why.

Not a ghost bloodied country
All covered with sleep
Where the black angel did weep
Not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother
Walked on through the night
With his hair in his face
On a long splintered cut from the knife of G.T.

The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long
To his skull-shrill yell

Shining brightly red-rimmed and
Red-lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind
On ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razor's
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gone to choose, choose again

Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
Where you come from
The stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame, choose again

And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on

If the stone glances off
Split didactics in two
Leave the colors of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose, if you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start

Start the game I che che che che I
Che che che ka tak koh
Choose to choose
Choose to choose, choose to go
Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit. It was now Mid-August which meant he had
been separated from Marsha for more than two months. Two months, and all he had
to show was three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone
calls. True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, and he to
Locust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. She would
date occasionally, but merely as amusement. She would remain faithful.
But lately Waldo had begun to worry. He had trouble sleeping at night and when
he did, he had horrible dreams. He lay awake at night, tossing and turning
underneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he
pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of
some neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.
It was more than the human mind could bear.
Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. Daytime fantasies of sexual
abandon permeated his thoughts. And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how
she really was. He, Waldo, alone understood this. He had intuitively grasped
every nook and cranny of her psyche. He had made her smile. She needed him, and
he wasn't there (Awww...).
The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled
to appear. He'd just finished mowing and etching the Edelsons lawn for a dollar
fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from
Marsha. There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company
of America inquiring into his awing needs. At least they cared enough to write.
It was a New York company. You could go anywhere in the mails. Then it struck
him. He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,
true, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly simple. He would ship himself
parcel post, special delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to
purchase the necessary equipment. He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a
medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build. He judged that
with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably. A few airholes,
some water, perhaps some midnight snacks, and it would probably be as good as
going tourist.
By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly packed and the post
office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. He'd marked the package
"Fragile", and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber
cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried to picture the look of awe and
happiness on Marsha's face as she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the
deliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. She
would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of
this before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne
up. He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.
Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It had been a very rough
weekend. She had to remember not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about
it though. After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all,
it was certainly the way of nature, and even though, no he didn't love her, he
did feel an affection for her. And after all, they were grown adults. Oh, what
Bill could teach Waldo - but that seemed many years ago.
Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen
door and into the kitchen. "Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside." "Ach, I
know what you mean, I feel all icky!" Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton
robe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on
the kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. "I'm supposed to be
taking these salt pills, but," she wrinkled her nose, "they make me feel like
throwing up." Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd
seen on television. "God, don't even talk about that." She got up from the
table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue
vitamins. "Want one? Supposed to be better than steak," and then attempted to
touch her knees. "I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again."
She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the
telephone. "Maybe Bill'll call," she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on
a cuticle. "After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him." "I
know what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place."
She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. "The thing is, after a
while, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't
really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know
what I mean." She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over
her mouth. "I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while," here
she bent forward in a whisper, "I wanted to!" Now she was laughing very loudly.
It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang
the doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson
opened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his
green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had
gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den. "What do you
think it is?" Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.
She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living
room. "I dunno."
Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the
muffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down
the center of the carton. "Why don't you look at the return address and see who
it's from?" Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the
vibrating footsteps. It would be soon.
Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. "Ah, god,
it's from Waldo!" "That schmuck!" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation.
"Well, you might as well open it," said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the
staple flap. "Ah sst," said Marsha, groaning, "he must have nailed it shut."
They tugged on the flap again. "My God, you need a power drill to get this
thing open!" They pulled again. "You can't get a grip." They both stood still,
breathing heavily.
"Why don't you get a scissor," said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but
all she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her
father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when
she came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter
in her hand. "This is the best I could find." She was very out of breath.
"Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die." She sank into a large fluffy couch and
exhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the
end of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough
room. "God damn this thing!" she said feeling very exasperated. Then smiling,
"I got an idea." "What?" said Marsha. "Just watch," said Sheila, touching her
finger to her head.
Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could
barely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his
heart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and
walked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her
knees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the
long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through
the cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of
Waldo Jeffers head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red
to pulsate gently in the morning sun.

Here comes the ocean
And the waves down by the sea
Insects are evil thoughts, thought of by selfish men
Nearly drives me crazy 
I am a lazy son
And I never get things done
'Cause we're made up of water but
Here comes the wave 
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of our land
That has been down by the sea 
Way down by the sea, down by the shore
Way down by the sea
Here comes the ocean 
And the waves down by the shore
Here comes the ocean 
And the waves down by the sea
Insects are evil thoughts, thought of by selfish men
It nearly drives me crazy
Now I am a lazy son
I never get things done
'Cause we're made up of water but
Here comes the wave 
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of our land
That has been down by the shore
Way down by the sea
Down by the shore
Down by the sea
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves

There she goes again
She's out on the streets again
She's down on her knees, my friend
But you know she'll never ask you please again

Train round the bend
Takin me away from my country
I'm sick of the trees
Take me to the city
Train comin' round the bend

Been in the country Oh much too long
Trying to be a farmer
But nothing that I planted never seems to grow
Train comin' round the bend

We're the Velvet Underground and we have come to play
It's been 28 years since we've been here to the day
There's Maureen, she's on the drums, she's havin' lot of fun

There is Sterling Morrison, he's playing the guitar
He's a guitar hero, kicks their asses really far
Now you got here John and me

That's because we think it is real pretentious shit
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I'm waiting for my man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand

What goes on in your mind?

Baby, be good, do what you should
You know it will work alright
Baby, be good, do what you should

Somebody's cut their string in two
Baby, be good, do what you should

One minute born, one minute doomed

You know it will work alright
Baby, be good, do what you should
You know it will be alright
Hey, oh
Sheets of empty canvas
Untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did
All five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn
Oh and all I taught her was everything
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by
Some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
So why do I sear
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin
Round my head
I'm spinning
Oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away
And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures had
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see
All that I am
All I'll be
Yeah
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky
But why
Why
Why can't it be
Why can't it be mine
Who loves the sun
Who cares that it makes plants grow
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart
Who loves the wind
Who cares that it makes breezes
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart
Pa Pa Pa Pa
Who loves the sun
Pa Pa Pa Pa
Who loves the sun

Not everyone

Who loves the sun
Who loves the rain
Who cares that it makes flowers
Who cares that it makes showers
Since you broke my heart
Who loves the sun
Who cares that it is shining
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart

The snow on your eyelids that curtsy with age
Is freezing the stares on tyranny's wings.
The bitter is hard and the warmth of your skin
Is diseased with familiar caresses.
Withdrawing from splendor and royal decay
Among all the triumphs and jaded awards
The angry and blazing circus of sun
Blasphemes as the crown prince arises.
You cannot beget all the sins that you owe
To the people of paradise magic
Pretend to answer passion and form
With foreign rationalizations.
Primroses are the jewels that lurk
Among masks of pleasure that flicker with doubt
Embraces of fame that's simultaneously fear
To advance and demand to be recognized.
The river shall flow through hollow green faces
Of caricature's resentment etched out of the tongues.
Both reluctant princess asleep before birth
The classical sensitive failures.
The worshipping wicked cling to the dark of your heart
Lying there and wait with your angels
Moan and ravish from dawn to dusk
The avaricious young lovers.
Wrap your troubles in dreams
Send them all away
Put them in a bottle and
Across the seas they'll stay
Speak not of misfortunes
Speak not of your woes
Just steal yourself a holiday
Crouching by the door
Ride and sway to music's pain
Searing with the sides
Caress it with a lover's touch
For it shall be your bride
Wrap your troubles in dreams
Send them all away
Put them in a bottle
And across the seas they'll stay
Slash the golden whip, it slaps
Across the lover's sides
The earth trembles without remorse
Preparing for to die
Salty ocean waves and sprays
Come crashing to the shore
Bullies kick and kill young loves
Down on barroom floors
Wrap your troubles in dreams
Send them all away
Put them in a bottle
And across the seas they'll stay
Violence echoes through the land
In heart of every man
The knife stabs existent wounds
Pulse runs through matted hair
The gleaming knife cuts early
Through the midnight air
Cutting entrails in its path
Blood runs without care
Excrement filters through the brain
Hatred bends the spine
Filth covers the body pores
To be cleansed by dying time
Wrap your troubles in dreams
Send them all away
Put them in a bottle
And across the seas they'll stay
One, two, three
If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out
And say hello to never

All the people are dancing
And they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me

But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the wine-glass out
And drink a toast to never

Oh, someday I know
Someone will look into my eyes
And say hello
You're my very special one

But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
And the people on subways and trains
Looking gray in the rain,
As they stand disarrayed
Oh, but people look well in the dark

And if you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out
And say hello to never

All the people are dancing
And they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me

Cause if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again
I'd never have to see the day again,
Once more
I'd never have to see the day again
In what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
To all tomorrow's parties
And where will she go, and what shall she do
When midnight comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown and cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties
And what will she do with Thursday's rags
When Monday comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown and cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
For whom none will go mourning

A blackened shroud
A hand-me-down gown
Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries
For all tomorrow's parties
If I could be anything in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come swooping after you
And if the last time you were here, things were a bit askew
Well, you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes loose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries loose their bark
All the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains boulder after you
If I could be anything of the things in this world that bite
Instead of being a tethered ocelot on a leash
I'd rather be your kite
And be tied to the end of your string
And flying in the air, babe, at night
Because you know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You've got a hairy minded big bare bear
And all the bells are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you
Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving down the street
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now, when people say her feet smell, they mean her nose
And curtains laced with diamonds, dear, for you
And kingdom's Christian sailors (soldiers), dear, for you
And melting ice cap mountains, dear, for you
And knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats, that with a kiss turn prince for you
Swoop, swoop, oh, baby, rock, rock ...

Now, now, now, now, now, now baby I'm beginning to see the night, now
It's comin' softer
Hey now, baby I'm beginning to see the light

And I just want to tell you everything was alright
Hey now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
Here comes two of you
Which one will you chose?
One is black and one is blue
Don't know just what to do, all right!
Well I'm beginning to see the light
All right now, here she comes!
Yeah, yeah, baby I'm beginning to see the light
Oh, some people work very hard
But still they never get it right
Well I'm beginning to see the light
Come on, let's get a little softer there now
Now, now, baby I'm beginning to see the light
Oh, it's coming around again
Hey now, now, now, now baby I'm beginning to see the light
One more time
There are problems in these times
But ooh, none of them are mine
Oh baby, I'm beginning to see the light
Here we go again
I thought that you were my friend
Here we go again
I thought that you were my friend

Candy says I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world
Candy says I'd like to know completely
What others so discretely talk about
I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me
Candy says I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be

I've lost a friend
